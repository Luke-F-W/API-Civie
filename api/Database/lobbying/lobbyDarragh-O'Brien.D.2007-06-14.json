    "Subject Matter":"Planning & Development Bill 2023",
    "Intended Results":"To acknowledge the progression of the Planning and Development Bill 2023 over the last number of months and the revision of the previous Planning and Development Act 2000, that we hope will make planning procedures more streamlined and easier for farm families to invest in the development of their enterprises.::To emphasise that it is imperative for farm families that planning applications are streamlined, effective, and not open to obstruction by false and unfounded claims by members of the public or organisations which have no sufficient interest in the progression of a planning procedure.::To highlight that it has never been more important for farmers to have the ability to invest in their enterprises to advance the sustainability and profitability of their businesses in the face of an increasingly uncertain policy environment. This is especially important in the context of increasing slurry\/nutrient storage on farms to improve nutrient balances, which IFA has communicated consistently over the past number of months.::To welcome the more comprehensive definition of sufficient interest in Section 271 of the proposed Bill for unincorporated bodies and hopes this will prevent unfounded legal claims being pursued by individuals or organisations whose only goal is to prevent the development of farm businesses. To also welcome the tighter time frame for judicial proceedings to be conducted under the new Bill and the more comprehensive nature of this section of Bill in its entirety.::To voice concerns  remaining within the proposed Bill which IFA seeks clarity on moving forward. Under Section 271 (3) of the proposed Bill, it remains a possibility for individuals to take judicial proceedings against planning applications regardless of whether they are directly or indirectly materially affected on the basis that the claimant has contributed relevant submissions in a material form prior to this.::This has the potential to undermine the firmer nature of the definition of sufficient interest for Organisations and Unincorporated bodies referenced above and thus has the potential to not resolve the issue of serial objection which has consistently disrupted planning procedures in rural areas for a number of years.::To note the previous definition in the Draft Planning and Development Bill 2022 in Section 249 (C) ;::(c) the applicant has a sufficient interest in the ground and for these purposes—::(i) an applicant shall not be regarded as having a sufficient interest for the purpose of this section unless that applicant is or may be directly or indirectly materially affected by the matters to which the application relates.::(ii) a sufficient interest shall not be limited to an interest in land or a financial interest.::To highlight the loss of this definition from the Planning and Development Bill as it provides a far clearer and more comprehensive definition of sufficient interest which may have helped prevent serial objectors from taking unfounded claims against planning applications that disrupt on farm development.::To show concern at the establishment of an Environmental Legal Assistance Fund under Section 280 of the proposed Bill. It is fair to presume that the safeguard of financial assistance in the face of a lost claim will only further promote the amount of unfounded environmental claims brought forward for judicial review.::This mechanism is disproportional and has the potential to hamper any progress made elsewhere in the Bill on making planning procedures faster and simpler for the development of farms and rural areas.::To highlight increased concern at the length of time it is taking to secure planning for environment structures such as slurry\/nutrient storage tanks or anaerobic digestion facilities. IFA believes that there should be an enabling clause in the legislation to allow local authorities to fast-track approvals for environmental infrastructure which are in line with Government policy.::To request that the concerns outlined above will be considered in their entirety prior to enacting the final legislation. Only those who have a direct interest in planning applications should have the ability to contest the legitimacy of an application, consistent with the definition outlined in the Draft Bill from 2022.::To also seek clarity on how the proposed Environmental Legal Assistance Mechanism will function and what type of claims may qualify for remuneration under this provision.::To highlight the vexatious nature of planning appeals that are disrupting farmers' plans to upgrade their farms and make them more efficient.::To emphasise that it is absolutely vital that the new Planning and Development Bill ensures farmer planning applications are not open to obstruction by false and unfounded claims by individuals or organisations who have no sufficient interest in the progression of a planning application.",
