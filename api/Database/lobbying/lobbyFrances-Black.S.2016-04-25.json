In relation to a psychosocial assessment completed by a mental healthcare professional member of the Multi-Disciplinary Team, we would propose that such assessments be specifically completed by a CORU registered mental health social worker. Mental health social workers are best placed to complete a psychosocial assessment, as th::as they have an appreciation for complex systemic factors, risk management and the various therapeutic approaches.::In relation to access to forensic assessments; “In the instance that a person is detained to ensure safety of others, access to a forensic assessment needs to be made available.” This is especially important in the context of families where there is risk of domestic violence, intimate partner homicide, parricide, filicide and intra and extra familial child homicide.::The new act should be informed by the guiding principles of trauma-informed care in relation to manual or other forms of seclusion and restraints. We would be particularly concerned by reports that mechanical restraint has been used in some of the inpatient child and adolescent facilities. We would ask that this legislation explicitly prohibits the use of mechanical restraint on children.::We note the legislation mandates the Mental Health Commission to visit and inspect every community mental health service at least once every five years. We would ask that it is clarified that this encompasses community mental health services for all age groups. We would also ask that the Mental Health Commission’s remit is extended to regulate low, medium, and high support HSE hostels. We would ask that all inpatient facilities are mandated to have a space that families can meet in privacy.::We support the change of terms in the report, including the use of mental disorder in appropriate contexts, the renaming of mental health review tribunals to mental health review boards. This is an important change as people often felt they had done something wrong if they needed to attend a tribunal. Such changes in technology are positive and welcomed.::We also welcome the changes in related to provision for children. We would ask that there is further exploration and development of the transition of children to adult mental health services. This area is inconsistent around the country – leading to serious issues in both CAMHS and Adult services.::We welcome the changes to the rules around consent for children. We would also seek appropriate clarity in the legislation of what would happen if a young person consented to treatments, but their guardian opposes it. We would also ask that the family or guardians of a young person are specifically included in the care of young people in inpatient facilities – this would ensure the best possible outcome when they return home.::We welcome the importance placed on advocacy and the role of the Guardian ad Litem.",
