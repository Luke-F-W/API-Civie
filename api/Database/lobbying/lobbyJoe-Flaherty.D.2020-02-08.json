This action aimed to address the issue by bringing it to the attention of the local council and Minister for Education. |Email|2-5::Telephone call between Penny and Andrea Feeney (CEO of State Examinations Commission) to discuss the impact of the ambiguous RACE guidelines for students who stammer, which ISA reported were causing inequitable access to oral exam accommodations.
