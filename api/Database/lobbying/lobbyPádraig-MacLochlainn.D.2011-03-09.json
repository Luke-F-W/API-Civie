An assessment of annual turnover for Irish Aquaculture (based on 2019 figure vs extrapolated 2020 figures) has shown a predicted 58% reduction of annual turnover for Irish aquaculture.::- The announcement of the Covid-19 Aquaculture Support Scheme worth €1.5m was made by Minister Charlie McConalogue at IFA Aquaculture’s AGM in October 2020. The announcement came almost 6 months after the EU Commission amended regulations to allow Member States to redirect available EMFF funds in response to the Covid-19 crisis, further meaningful State support will be needed to assist the sector in navigating the challenges of Covid-19 and Brexit.::- The implementation of the ‘Aquaculture licensing review recommendations’ continues to be a key policy for IFA Aquaculture, seeking a clear commitment from the incoming Minister with regard to an implementation plan that prioritises and gives clear timelines for each of the recommendations outlined in the review.::- In broad terms the objectives of the draft National Marine Planning Framework, address a no. of recommendations outlined in the recent ‘Review of the Aquaculture Licensing Process’, where the report concluded that the aquaculture licensing system was in ‘urgent need of reform’. However, IFA Aquaculture notes that Department of Agriculture, Food & Marine is not referenced in regard to the ‘Marine Planning and Development Management Bill’ and it would appear that proposed legislative framework::- The ‘Strategic Guidelines for Sustainable EU Aquaculture’ have been drafted by DG MARE. These updated guidelines aim to inform Member States as they update National Strategic Plans for Sustainable Aquaculture, which are currently being drafted by BIM and DAFM.::- Aquaculture provides for one of the most carbon efficient sources of protein, when there is an increasing demand globally for sustainable sources of protein.::- Consideration must be given to the role of the aquaculture industry as a carbon efficient source of sustainable protein. Aquaculture also contributes to the control of nitrogen\/phosphorous removal shellfish are filter feeders which aids to reduce eutrophication of waters.::- Food production has never been more important and the current Covid-19 crisis has shown the value of sustainable food production systems. There is now a significant opportunity for aquaculture in light of the increasing global demand for seafood, more sustainable food sources, and carbon efficient food production.::- These growing demands along with the recently announced ‘EU Green Deal’, provide a real opportunity for the aquaculture sector to position itself as part of the solution to these growing demands and acknowledging the role Aquaculture has to play in sustainable food production and the Covid-19 recovery plan.::- The ‘Farm to Fork Strategy’ addresses the challenges of sustainable food systems and recognises the links between healthy people, healthy societies and a healthy planet. We appreciate the relevant role that this strategy places on aquaculture.",
