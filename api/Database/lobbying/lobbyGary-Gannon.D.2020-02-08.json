    "Intended Results":"In respect of item number 2(a), ‘Revised Draft of the Street Performance Bye-Laws 2016’ (the “Bye-Laws”) as at June 21, 2016, Dublin City Buskers (“DCB”) remark the following:::•\tDCB welcomes the conciliatory initiative for Temple Bar proposed by Dublin City Council whereby limited 'acoustic' performances are permitted in the extended prohibited zone marked along Fleet Street to Temple Lane South. The interests of residents seeking removal of amplified performance in the proximity of their homes have been accommodated while simultaneously preserving the tradition of street performance, in a limited form in the area.  It is regrettable that Temple Bar Residents were not::more engaged in the forum on street performance coordinated by Dublin City Council (the “Forum”), and it is hoped that this initiative will be welcomed as satisfactory bearing in mind the significant deprival amounting to an amplifier ban in Temple Bar leaving ‘Temple Bar Square’ as the only area where amplifiers are permitted.::•\tNotwithstanding the above, DCB wishes to express dissatisfaction that this initiative was not extended to all prohibited areas as described in the Bye-Laws, including the GPO, in line with Forum discussions.::•\tIt remains the position of DCB that a EUR10 renewal fee for existing permit-holders and permit-holders renewing in the future should be reflected in the Bye-Laws and respectfully ask you to fully support a motion to reform the current permitting system.::•\tDCB welcomes the initiative for one-hour performance times beginning and ending on the hour mark; however, it is regrettable that this initiative was not applied beyond Grafton Street and across the city in order to reduce repetition and increase variety and clarity with respect to the operation of the system.::•\tAiming to reduce repetition and improve quality standards, DCB supports a minimum repertoire of 60 minutes for permit holders instead of 30 minutes recommended by DCC::•\tDCB is not in support of a complete ban on backing tracks, preferring assessment based on quality and necessity.::•\tDCB recognises that the Bye-Laws lack definitions for “generator” and “large band”, and highlight risk of expansive interpretation and\/or onerous application of the Bye-Laws.::•\tSimilarly, DCB is concerned that the 'one-strike' rule for probationary permits are somewhat onerous for new and\/or young performers, and believe that the proposed ‘three strike rule’, should apply here also.::DCB would like to thank Dublin City Council for the kind facilitation of the Bye-Laws in advance of the June 21, Arts Culture and Recreation Strategic Policy Committee meeting, and for coordinating the Street Performance Forum. We hope further progressive steps for street performance in Dublin can be achieved transparently and in the spirit of cooperation.::Beannachtaí, Le meas,  Na Stiúrthóirí ó Dublin City Buskers.",
