However, it must be funded through an increase in the CAP budget or from the implementation of the EU genuine farmer definition. It cannot be funded by reduced per hectare payments above the average. The objectives of convergence should be achieved through upwards only adjustments in payments per hectare.::That a full sectoral impact analysis of the convergence proposals be conducted. CAP reform 2021-2027 must not create move unviable farmers.::That the genuine farmer concept be fully explored in the context of the need to target payments towards active farmers. A further issue to be evaluated in the context of defining the genuine farmer, is the practice of farmers leasing out their entitlements, having exited farming.::That in the context of increased CAP funding the option of introducing more coupled payments as part of the next CAP must be considered in targeting support to active farmers in vulnerable sectors::That the current EU Commission position on capping be supported and that leased-in entitlements are excluded from the calculation, and family employment and formal partnerships are factored in.::That Pillar I eco-schemes should be voluntary for Member States and farmers. That measures under Pillar I eco-schemes must not undermine environmental schemes in Pillar II. Where eco-schemes are entered into, they should not involve additional costs on the farmer, and the schemes must be simple and easy to apply for. ANCs should be allowed as part of the 40% environmental calculation requirement (Pillar I and Pillar II)::That all farmers, including those selected for inspection, must get at least 70% of their BPS payment in mid-October. Issues arising for farmers selected for inspections thereafter can be resolved from the 30% balancing payment. • A close-out system on inspections to allow farmers time to correct unintentional non-compliances without incurring penalties.::No increase in cross-compliance requirements, with full recognition for existing Statutory Minimum Requirements (SMRs) and Good Agricultural and Environmental Conditions (GAECs) achieved by farmers. • Targets and indicators imposed on Member States must be realistic and not add to complexity or delay payments. • Farmers must be adequately compensated to cover costs of any increase in requirements and standards.::On Rural Development IFA proposes:::• Increased funding from €4bn to €5bn for the RDP 2021- 2027 to support farm schemes.::• Targeted sectoral support for sucklers (€200\/cow), sheep (€30\/ewe) & tillage (per\/ha payment).::• Whole farm environmental schemes, similar to REPS, with a maximum payment of €10,000 per farm, with higher payments for designated Natura SAC and SPA lands.::• An increased annual allocation of over €300m for the ANC scheme.::• TAMs investment scheme be made available for all sectors, with 70% grant aid for young farmers and 50% for all others.::• Introduction of increased funding to support farmers involved in environmental and economic resource efficiency programmes, such as the Smart Farming programme.::• Strong measures to support committed young farmers across all schemes.::• Minimise leakage of funds for advisory and service providers.::• The introduction of user-driven knowledge exchange models, such as e-Learning tools.::• A payment for EcoSystem Services, for biodiversity and establishment of more broadleaf woodlands.::Generational renewal: Strong support for committed young farmers to include: preferential national reserve, top up payments (BPS TAMs and Installation aid), partnership supports and mainstreaming of the land mobility service.::• The introduction of a retirement scheme to encourage transfer of farms::• Taxation policy to incentivise and support young trained farmers.::• Entitlement transfer system that favours active farmers and committed new entrants::Removal of the €70,000 limit placed on young trained farmers under Article 18 EU Commission Regulation (EU) No. 702\/2014.::Producer Organisations (POs)::CAP post 2020 continues to support POs for all sectors. • The costs, rules, regulations and administrative burden, including reporting and inspections of POs, be simplified further to encourage uptake. • Additional funding to support establishment and ongoing running costs is required. • Additional protections are required against the unfair treatment of POs by buyers.::• The environmental requirements under Article 44 of COM(2018) 392\/3 CAP reform 2021-2027 should be retained at current levels.::Potato producers must qualify under the EU Fruit and Vegetable PO scheme.",
