This ensures that adults at risk of harm receive holistic perspectives and best outcomes in safeguarding responses.::The single profession approach, so evident in the medical model traditionally employed, must be dismantled by the HSE, and replaced with more effective – MDT – approaches.::All investigation reports relevant to safeguarding must be routinely published to inform learning and change practice. Onerous work is currently required to understand the lessons of unpublished or hard to access reports. In the absence of the publication of the Brandon report, IASW members have shared lessons from formal and informal briefings on the Brandon case to understand the learning for social work. Parliamentary questions prompted by IASW members were required to unearth, thanks to 1\/2::Fergus O’ Dowd T.D. for example, the disciplinary findings of the Aras Attracta Trust in Care Review. Data produced by the National Safeguarding Office on reporting of adult safeguarding concerns (and by whom) remains weak. The routine publication of safeguarding investigation reports allows relevant stakeholders to understand the lessons learned and subsequently monitor how that learning is translated into policy and practice. 2\/2::The HIQA remit to be extended to include inspections of Safeguarding and Protection Social Work teams. Just as we call for holistic perspectives in the delivery of safeguarding, so too, we call for external eyes and perspectives in social work practice. HIQA inspections will ensure that any gaps in the delivery of safeguarding social work practice are identified and addressed.",
