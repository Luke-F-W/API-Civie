    "Subject Matter":"National Outdoor Recreation Strategy 2023-2027",
    "Intended Results":"IFA strongly reject the proposal of Keeping Ireland Open (KIO) which can be summarised in short by seeking legal rights for recreational users to access private farmland for recreational use, such as hills and commonage areas.::To highlight the need for sufficient enforcement of permissive agreements. Currently in Ireland, the majority of land is privately owned. Many recreational users may have a view that there should be more open public access as they have in the UK & other EU countries. This is not the case, as many perceived Public Rights of Way are in fact only 'permissive paths' where the landowner is entitled to withdraw consent at any time.::Public access in the UK is limited to registered sites only (approx.. 8% of English lands), with clear parameters in place. Some are similar to that currently employed here in Ireland by way of permissive agreements, but here we lack sufficient enforcement, something which would amplify concerns were public access be granted.::To insist that the role of the landowner should not be diminished when compared to the rights and privileges of those accessing private land for recreational use, especially when many of the routes pass close to farm yards & dwellings. It is important to remember that without private landowner consent many of the current recreational areas would not exist.::IFA would have serious concern about removing the rights of landowners to refuse permission to their land. Recent events concerning alleged physical assault of a farmer, who refused access to a trail, has resulted in the closing of this walking trail. While such extremes are rare, they cannot be tolerated.::While hill areas\/commonages may be vast in size, they are still part of working farms. Lambing\/calving season are particularly sensitive times of the year. Any disturbance to animals at this time of year would spark serious concern for animal welfare from landowners.  The presence of walkers during this time can also be extremely dangerous for users.::To highlight how the issue of dogs on the hills also poses a serious threat. IFA have a strong stance on ‘No Dogs Allowed' under any circumstance on farmland at any time of the year. Dog attacks are causing unimaginable suffering for sheep and lambs and huge economic losses for farmers. All dog owners must behave in a responsible way and adhere to this. All dog owners should take heed that they are fully liable for all damage and suffering caused to farmers and their sheep by their dogs.::To highlight how further strengthening the Occupiers Liability Act to address some of the concerns of landowners will be beneficial as landowners can't be responsible for recreational users on their land. Liability is a major cause for concern for many landowners who agree access routes for recreational activity through their land. ::To highlight that both IFA and KIO are represented on Comhairle na Tuaithe (The Countryside Council). The recent launch of the National Outdoor Recreation Strategy (NORS) by Minister Heather Humphreys outlines a vision, mission and series of actions which will lead, guide and facilitate the sustainable development and management of the outdoor recreation sector for the next five years.::Section 5 of the document outlines actions related to improving Access for recreational activity. Action 5.5 relates to expanding the Walks Scheme to 150 walks, which IFA have long lobbied for. The walks scheme currently supports approximately 2,400 farmers across the country to maintain walking trails through their land. The recently announced expansion will further support farmers in walkway maintenance, improve access for users and boost rural tourism.",
