In this regard, the regulatory provision governing circumvention is set out in EU Regulation 2116\/2021 in Article 62 - Circumvention Clause.::- Without prejudice to specific provisions of Union law, Member State shall take effective and proportionate measures to avoid provisions of Union law to be circumvented and ensure, in particular, that no advantage provided for under agricultural legislation is granted in favour of a natural or legal person in respect of whom it is established that the conditions required for obtaining such advantages were created artificially, contrary to the objectives of that legislation.y::- In order to comply with this Regulatory requirement, the Department is obliged to highlight this provision to prospective scheme applicants. With regard to the National Reserve, the Terms and Conditions refer to the Circumvention clause and provide and example of circumvention as the removal of existing entitlements from land for the purpose of creating 'naked land' upon which a National Reserve allocation may be made.::The Department's concern is cases where there is a clear and obvious attempt to artificially create conditions required to obtain advantage under schemes. Payment entitlements are not attached to land and the owner of the entitlements has the option to transfer the entitlements by methods including sale or lease in line with normal business decisions regarding the farming enterprise and the future of the holding or the individual.::The Department cannot give pre-approval for an application or for the inclusion of particular land as part of an application. Each application must be considered in its entirety when it has been submitted following the scheme closing date, including the land submitted in support of the application.::However, all applications will also be considered in the context of the intention of the support measure, which is generational renewal in the case of the National Reserve, and the steps required to facilitate generational renewal within the holding. Where a case is found to be outside the spirit and intention of the support measure the Department's concern will be that a clear and obvious attempt has been made to artificially create the conditions to benefit.::. A genuine application submitted in keeping with the spirit and intention of the scheme is the basis on which the Department seeks to approve support measures for young farmers and new entrants. The Department may require further information in relation to an application when the applications are being processed and, in this regard, you should satisfy yourself that the application is in compliance with the objectives, and the Terms and Conditions, of the scheme.",
