In this regard, the growing media companies who produce the peat, and the primary horticulture producers who are the end users, must be at the table.::Usage of Peat in the Horticultural Industry::Due to a Supreme Court decision earlier this year, there has been no harvesting of peat on bogs over 30ha resulting in big reduction of stocks required by the horticulture sector.::There is no commercial alternative currently available to the use of peat, a point which is expanded on in IFA's submission  to the consultation process into the use of peat in the horticultural industry and also in Teagasc's submission on same.::As a result of this Supreme Court case, procedures around applying for leave to apply for substitute consent are required. We understand the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government are currently drafting legislation to rectify this particular matter. However, even if this is resolved, companies still have to apply for substitute consent from An Bord Pleanála, then planning from Local Authorities and finally a licence from the EPA.::Even in a best-case scenario one is looking at a timeframe of 2 to 5 years.::In the event of Irish peat not being available, it will be imported adding extra costs to production, while also adding to the carbon footprint of the plants and crops produced.::Importance for our horticulture producers to have access to Irish peat for the viability of the industry.",

Uncontrolled dogs are causing serious animal health and welfare issues for our animals and significant financial losses as a result of attacks and killings that occur.::Dog owners are required to have a dog licence and to have their dogs microchipped.  Oligations of dog owners must be enforced.::The lack of compliance with these obligations is unacceptable and cannot be allowed to continue. Local Authorities must enforce the current obligations on dog owners in a more effective way.::There is an urgent need to strengthen the legislation, include appropriate sanctions and develop a single national database identifying dogs and their owners.::More needs to be done by local authorities through enforcement and information and awareness campaigns for dog owners, pointing out their obligations and the damage their uncontrolled dogs are doing to farm animals.",

Afforestation on peat soils in acid sensitive catchments must stop. ::6.\tThe Plan cannot ignore the coast. It must set out all coastal-specific pressures and the measures to address them.::7.\tWater governance must be made transparent and brought into compliance with the Aarhus Convention.
