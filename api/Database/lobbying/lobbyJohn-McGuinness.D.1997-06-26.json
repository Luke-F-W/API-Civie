Credit outstanding at the end of 2020 is €3.3 billion.  According to the Central Bank, the cost of credit for agri-borrowers is higher than other SME-borrowing  and well above the EU-average. The diminishing level of competition in the lending sector has been  further eroded by NatWest’s recent decision to end its Ulster Bank operations in Ireland.::To acknowledge this Bill and look forward to its implementation. As it stands, Personal Contract Plans (PCPs) are an unregulated form of lending and this legislation will provide greater transparency.::To recommend regular detailed reporting on the lending which is carried out under PCPs. It would be useful if data is collected and made available every six months on the amount and types of these loans.  Specifically, it would be welcome to be able to see which agri sub-sectors (e.g. dairy\/beef\/sheep\/poultry)  are availing of PCP finance. The agri-sector as a whole will benefit from this increased transpareny.",
