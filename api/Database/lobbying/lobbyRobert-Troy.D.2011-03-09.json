This is because a commercial operator has suggested they service the premises.  This needs to be reviewed and amended to ensure businesses are connected.::Tullow Industrial Estate spends est €50k pa on leased lines and they need more stable and quality connections, engineers have advised it would be straight forward to connect the estate and this needs to happen to continue supporting the 400+ working here::The NBI rollout plan is too rigid and needs to allow for changes, especially give the challenges that have seen so many changes in the country over the last 14 months::The definition of broadband as used by the department and NBI as 30mbps down and 6mbps up is outdated and needs to be changed to reflect modern demands and requirements",

    "Subject Matter":"A letter concerning the appointment of extra High Court Judges",
    "Intended Results":"Introduce the automatic striking out of court proceedings if there has been no activity in the case for 12 months, without the need for a court hearing.::Shorten the period within which proceedings must be served to three months and require an attempt at service by registered post or personal service within that period or the action is automatically struck out; this would stop plaintiffs delaying and would also avoid unnecessary court hearings::Require plaintiffs in personal injuries matters to furnish a copy of all medical notes and records for three years before and one year after an accident, within three months of service of proceedings. This would avoid wasting court time with discovery applications that are always granted of this category.::Set the PIAB Form A to be the originating court document if an assessment is not accepted. This would save court and court office time.::Identify categories of discovery documents in straightforward cases; e.g. photographs of the scene of an accident, any non-privileged contemporaneous witness statements that will be presumed to be discoverable, and which must be discovered by plaintiff and defendant. This would streamline straightforward matters.::The maximum legal costs permitted should be set by law. There should be scales for the value of the claim, the type of issues and whether it is settled or run to trial. This is already done in the district court, and German Federal Courts provide an even more comprehensive scale. This incentivises resolving matters efficiently.::Charge parties for judges' time. There should be a maximum High Court judge time for particular types of case. Beyond this, the court fees should rise (and come out of the overall budget).::Use judges’ time better. Improved informal (by appointment; not by court list) case management by court officials, Masters or deputy judges. Our system of case management is too formal and judges are too involved. We have one High Court Master whereas in Northern Ireland they have seven, who do a lot of this type of work. Equally, in England are more masters and deputy judges who do much of the organisational side pre-trial. This is done much more efficiently in chambers.::Use witness statements as the evidence of the witness so that the hearing involves cross-examination only, as is the norm in England and Wales::Require that judgments are limited in length barring extreme exceptions. A lot of High Court judges' time is taken in the writing of decisions on cases that are of little or no precedent value.::Require that costs must follow the event. This is already set out in law and is a rule of the superior courts, but it is routinely ignored by judges. Plaintiffs dismissed as fraudulent by a lower court are free to appeal to the High Court or the Court of Appeal without a care as to their ability to pay their costs if they fail.",

    "Intended Results":"To mandate Joint Audit in certain circumstances and to permit an extended audit tenure in Ireland where a company adopts the joint audit model for its European business. This would increase Joint Audits in Ireland and support international businesses to manage the rotation of auditors in a longer timeline, and provide the Boards of, in particular, US companies with greater flexibility in co-ordinating US and European audit teams.",
    "Lobbying Activities":"This was a follow-up meeting to discuss Mazar’s perspective on Audit Reform and how it has advanced in the last six months both in Europe and in the UK, which are the key sources of Ireland’s audit and accounting regulations. Key points discussed included • How the lack of progress in expanding meaningfully the number of market participants in the audit market poses a threat to the resilience of European economies, including Ireland. • The importance to Ireland of its a role as a ‘bridge’ between Europe, the UK, and the US, and the economic impact of possible audit failure on that role. • The increasing importance of the European “Green Deal” and the key role of the Non-Financial Reporting Directive both in furthering the goals of the Green Deal and in shaping the development of the audit market. • The role of Joint Audit as an important contributor to a more resilient audit market.|Virtual Meeting|1::To arrange the meeting.|Phone call|1",
