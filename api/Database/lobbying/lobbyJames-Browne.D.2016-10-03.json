They will be joined in this by other major operators, including Bet365, Betway, The Kindred Group and many more.\n\nThe Code represents a set of minimum commitments by the industry, which are drawn from best practice elsewhere and reflect the particular circumstances of the Irish market. Operators can and do in many cases, go above and beyond the provisions of the Code.\nWe believe these are important changes for customers and represent the single widest industry initiative seen in Ireland since the introduction of Safer Gambling Week.

    "Intended Results":"To advocate for a well-regulated licensing system that considers the interests of all stakeholders, ensuring a sustainable future for shooting and its contributions to Irish society. Improvements can be made to the licensing system for the benefit of all stakeholders. Standardised and consistent processes, specific firearm training for all personnel involved in overseeing firearms legislation and an online application system would improve consistency, efficiency, and fairness.::To highlight the multifaceted benefits of shooting and fostering a well-regulated licensing system, we can nurture sustainable and thriving rural communities while maintaining public confidence.::To highlight the importance of shooting in the context of farming and recreation.::Vermin Control  Farmers are the largest group of firearm holders in Ireland. It is imperative that the tools necessary for farmers and their agents to protect the health and welfare of their animals and production levels of crops on their farms continue to be available. Vermin control is of utmost importance for farmers, as vermin can cause considerable damage to both livestock and crop yields.::To highlight that the use of firearms is a key method for controlling vermin populations and ensuring the safety and health of farm animals, which in turn contributes to the farmers' livelihood and the overall agricultural economy. The responsible use of firearms for vermin control also reduces the need for chemical interventions, fostering a more sustainable and environmentally friendly approach to pest management in the Irish countryside.::That the use of moderators\/silencers is crucial for effective vermin control. These tools help minimise noise disturbance, preventing the startling of other livestock and reducing stress on the animals. This contributes to a more efficient and humane approach to vermin control on Irish farms.::To recommend that moderators\/silencers should be regarded as essential tools for vermin control and for deer management\/control.

The protection of the curlew is just one example of how well-managed hunting, combined with focused conservation programs, can play a significant role in safeguarding native species and preserving Ireland's biodiversity. The Curlew Conservation programme is an example where local famers and gun clubs work together to pro::To highlight that Shooting clubs invest in habitat management & conservation projects contributing to the overall health of the countryside. The over-regulation or restriction of shooting could lead to significant ecological issues and place an additional burden on the government to manage these problems. Well managed hunting can mitigate against many threats to biodiversity. 1::Ecological Monitoring  Hunting activities often require monitoring and research, which can provide valuable data on population dynamics, species behaviour, and habitat health. This information can be used to inform conservation strategies and management plans, leading to more effective protection of biodiversity.::By engaging hunters in data collection and scientific observation, hunting can contribute to a better understanding of species' ecology and the impacts of human activities on their habitats.::Conservation Funding  Well-regulated hunting activities can generate revenue that can be used for conservation efforts. For instance, a proportion of hunting licenses fees, and taxes can be directed towards habitat restoration, wildlife management, and conservation projects. These funds can support initiatives like reforestation, wetland conservation, and species monitoring, which contribute to the overall protection of biodiversity in Ireland.::Mental Health and Well-being  Shooting activities, predominantly in rural regions of sometimes dispersed communities where the opportunity for social interaction may be limited, serve not solely as a form of leisure but extend to play a crucial role in social interaction and the bolstering of mental health for many of the inhabitants.This engagement often forms an intrinsic part of rural community dynamics, further evidenced by the active participation of shooting enthusiasts in charitable event::The sport cultivates a spirit of camaraderie and community cohesiveness, establishing an environment conducive to mitigating feelings of isolation and loneliness sentiments often exacerbated by the inherent geographic dispersion in rural landscapes. Moreover, the participation in shooting activities has ancillary benefits such as promoting physical fitness, acting as an effective medium for stress relief, and fostering an appreciation of the natural environment.::The health benefits of shooting. Shooting is a prime example of an activity that takes place in the natural environment. Shooting sports teach discipline and focus. Competitive shooting sports offer a platform for athletes to showcase their talent, represent their country in international competitions and bring pride to their communities.::To highlight the Revenue that shooting generates  The sport generates significant revenue through license fees, sporting goods sales, and tourism. 2A study in Ireland (2007) show that hunters contribute €111.6m to the national economy of which 80-90% was spent in rural areas.::To highlight that there are a number of areas where the current licensing system can be improved for the benefit of all stakeholders::Implementation of an online firearm application system to streamline the process and make it more accessible for applicants.::That the Issuance of a receipt or acknowledgement of application with a reference number to provide transparency and allow tracking the progress of applications.::Inconsistency  Addressing the issue of extensive discretion granted to Garda Superintendents in granting firearm licenses by advocating for a standardised and harmonised licensing process. This will help eliminate inconsistencies in license approvals, even across different counties. Collaboration with stakeholders will ensure fairness and accountability.::Reformatting the firearms certificate to enhance its durability and include the holder's photograph for improved identification.::Provision of specific firearm training for all personnel involved in overseeing firearms legislation to enhance their knowledge and competence in this area.::Centralisation of the licensing authority within An Garda Síochána with appropriate input from local districts\/divisions during the licensing process.::Shifting the focus of licensing from individual firearms to licensing the individual person, removing limitations on the number of firearms a person may possess, use, or carry. The requirement should be satisfying a valid 'good reason' and meeting necessary security standards.::Establishment of a non-judicial appeals mechanism to address firearms licensing decisions, providing applicants with a fair recourse for review.::Introducing a letter of intent to refuse a firearms license application, issued prior to a refusal decision, to allow applicants an opportunity to provide additional relevant information that could potentially influence the licensing decision.::Insurance  Farmers provide access to hunters to use their land. Mandating regulated insurance which includes liability cover as a prerequisite for firearm certification, ensures that all stakeholders are adequately protected. This measure would safeguard their interests and act as a safeguard by providing financial protection and mitigating the potential financial burden on individuals involved in firearm-related incidents.::Shooting on private land in Ireland predominantly takes place through mutually agreed access arrangements between the gun club\/shooter and the local landowner, fostering a wellestablished relationship built on trust. This informal understanding honours the farmer's right to determine whether written permission is necessary, acknowledging their discretion in choosing to require or forgo such documentation.::Gun clubs provide an important service to local farmers through their knowledge and skill in effective vermin control. This valuable service helps protect crops and livestock which has a direct economic affect and also contributes to wildlife management.::Access should always be by agreement only. In recent times there have been a number of incidents nationwide involving gangs with dogs, illegal hunting and trespassing on lands with a 10  P a g e number of assaults, threats and intimidation warnings against farmers and landowners. Finding a middle ground that acknowledges the benefits of written permission while preserving the flexibility and trust within the shooting community would be ideal.::Written Permission  This could involve promoting voluntary written agreements as a best practice, recognising the importance of open communication and understanding between shooters and landowners. Offering support and resources to facilitate the process, such as standardised templates or guidance, can help streamline the paperwork without imposing unnecessary burdens.::Ultimately, striking a balance between formalisation and the existing trust-based approach is key to ensuring effective vermin control, preserving landowner autonomy, and fostering sustainable relationships between gun clubs and farmers. The aim should be to maintain the valuable services provided by gun clubs while addressing any concerns raised by both sides and working towards a mutually beneficial solution.::Data collection and analysis  implement a centralised system to collect and analyse data on firearm licenses, including types of firearms owned and incidents involving firearms. This can help identify pattern trends and potential areas for improvement in the licensing process.::Continuous evaluation and improvement  establish a mechanism for continuous evaluation and improvement of the firearm licensing system, including periodic reviews, feedback mechanisms and the ability to adapt to changing circumstances or emerging challenges.::Firearm safety education  promote mandatory firearm safety education and training for first-time applicants::Collaboration with stakeholders  foster regular communication and collaboration with relevant stakeholders to gather feedback and insights on the licensing system and make informed improvements.::IFA emphasises that, while the establishment of a Public Consultation Platform is a step towards gathering users' views, it is crucial to observe the limitations it presents and that this platform alone will not be sufficient for effective decision-making. Feedback from our members highlights the challenges faced in completing the online survey.::Many individuals found it difficult to provide meaningful input due to the technical terminology and the lack of opportunity to provide open-ended responses. This presents a significant barrier for meaningful participation. Meaningful participation and engagement of individuals and groups is vital to ensure a comprehensive understanding of diverse perspectives and to foster collaborative solutions.::IFA stress that it is imperative to go beyond the online survey and actively involve people in face-to-face discussions, workshops or public forums eg the Firearm Conference held in Mullingar in 2008. These interactive settings provide an opportunity for stakeholders to engage in open dialogue, share their valuable expertise and experiences and contribute to informed decision-making::Going forward, the establishment of a firearm forum or consultancy panel will ensure an open dialogue between all relevant parties and facilitate the crafting of well-informed firearm legislation that takes into account the unique needs of rural communities and the shooting community.::IFA would require further clarification and discussion on expanding the framework of the current firearm licensing system to require authorisations for clubs by An Garda Síochána. It is important to acknowledge that these clubs are already functioning effectively and play a significant role in rural Ireland. Imposing additional layers of authorisation may introduce unnecessary bureaucracy.::These clubs have already established their own internal regulations, safety protocols, and oversight mechanisms to ensure responsible firearm use among their members. They have demonstrated a commitment to promoting safety, fostering a sense of community, and providing valuable services such as vermin control and wildlife management.::By functioning autonomously, these clubs have been able to adapt to the specific needs and circumstances of their local communities. This collaborative approach has proven to be efficient, practical, and responsive to the unique challenges faced by rural communities.::In some areas there may be limited availability of shooting clubs. This could pose a challenge for individuals living in remote rural areas or urban environments.::On the other hand, club membership would allow for a level of oversight and accountability. Club officials can monitor the behaviour and conduct of members, ensuring that they adhere to club rules and regulations. Thus, helping to maintain high standards of conduct and responsible firearm ownership.::Expanding the involvement of An Garda Síochána in the authorisation process could introduce unnecessary delays, administrative burdens, and potential inconsistencies in the management of these clubs. It would require additional resources and monitoring to ensure compliance and proper oversight.::IFA disagrees with the recommendation of introducing different types of firearm certificates aligned with the purpose for which the firearm has been sought. While the intention behind this proposal may be to provide greater specificity and control, implementing such a system would be impractical and unworkable in the Irish context.::1. Administrative complexity   Introducing multiple types of firearm certificates would significantly increase administrative complexity for both applicants and licensing authorities. the process of evaluating and categorizing firearms based on their intended purpose would require extensive resources, expertise, and time. this could lead to backlogs in the licensing process, undermining the timely acquisition of firearms for legitimate purposes.::2. Ambiguity and Interpretation  Determining the exact purpose for which a firearm is sought can be subjective and open to interpretation. Differentiating between categories such as target shooting, limited hunting and shooting wildlife, or hunting and shooting wildlife may create ambiguity and disagreements regarding the appropriate categorisation of firearms. This could result in inconsistencies in the application and approval process, leading to confusion and potential legal challenges.::3. Fluid Nature of Firearms Use   Firearms are versatile tools that serve multiple purposes depending on the situation and need. Restricting firearm certificates to specific purposes fails to acknowledge the dynamic nature of firearm use. many individuals engage in a variety of shooting activities, including target shooting, vermin control, and hunting, which may require different firearms based on factors such as distance, accuracy and calibre.::Limiting firearms to specific certificates may impeded individuals' ability to adapt to changing circumstances and restrict their lawful activities.::4. Practicality for Rural Areas   Rural areas in Ireland often have diverse wildlife management and vermin control needs. Farmers, Landowners, and gamekeepers face a range of challenges in protecting their livestock, crops and natural habitats. Restricting firearm certificates to specific purposes may hinder their ability to effectively address these challenges. The current licensing system allows for flexibility, enabling individuals to utilise firearms based on their own needs.::5. Potential Disincentive for Participation - Introducing complex categorisations for firearm certificates may discourage individuals from engaging in shooting sports or other legitimate firearm - relating activities. The increased complexity, associated costs, and potential limitations imposed by specific-purpose certificates could deter individuals from pursuing these activities, resulting in a negative impact on sports shooting clubs, vermin control efforts, and overall participation in::The increased complexity, associated costs, and potential limitations imposed by specific-purpose certificates could deter individuals from pursuing these activities, resulting in a negative impact on sports shooting clubs, vermin control efforts, and overall participation in in responsible firearm use.::To highlight how, rather than implementing a rigid system of different types of firearm certificates, it is more practical and effective to maintain a flexible licensing framework that ensures appropriate background checks, training requirements, and adherence to safety regulations. This approach allows individuals to use firearms responsibly while accomodating the diverse needs and activities relating to firearms in Ireland.::There should be no Limit on the number and types of firearms a person may hold::It is important to note that the vast majority of firearm owners in Ireland are law-abiding citizens who adhere to regulations and guidelines. Imposing limits on the number of firearms they can possess may unfairly penalise responsible individuals while doing little to address any potential public safety concerns. Instead, the focus should be on effective background checks, licensing procedures, and ongoing monitoring to identify individuals who may pose a risk to public safety.::Rural areas in Ireland often have unique challenges and rely on responsible firearm ownership for various purposes. Limiting the number and types of firearms individuals can possess could adversely impact rural communities, where firearms play a significant role in protecting agricultural interests and maintaining a balance between wildlife conservation and agricultural practices.::Imposing a limit on the number of firearms a person can possess fails to recognise the diverse needs and circumstances of firearm owners. A person may possess multiple firearms due to participation in various disciplines of shooting.::Graded Security Standards::Balancing the need for enhanced security measures with practicality and individual circumstances is crucial when considering graded security arrangements for multiple firearm holders. The aim should be to promote responsible firearm ownership while addressing legitimate security concerns in a manner that is reasonable, effective, and proportional to the associated risks.::It is important to consider that multiple firearm holders may have different reasons for owning multiple firearms, such as different shooting disciplines, hunting purposes, or specific needs for vermin control. Applying a standardised graded security arrangement without considering individual circumstances could be overly restrictive and may not effectively address the actual security concerns.::Training and Qualifications::IFA acknowledges the importance of appropriate training for first-time applicants seeking firearm certificates in Ireland. However, training options should not be limited to taking place at specific shooting ranges. There are existing models and courses that can effectively provide comprehensive training, and oversight for such training can be conducted jointly by the Department of Justice and An Garda Síochána.::The Department of Justice and An Garda Síochána can establish a system of accreditation and certification for training providers to ensure that the programs offered meet the necessary standards and align with national requirements.::This would allow for consistent quality and adherence to training guidelines across different training models. The Department of Justice and An Garda Síochána can play a crucial role in overseeing the training process, ensuring that it meets national standards and guidelines for firearm competency and safety.::Implementing a mandatory minimum requirement for firearm certificate holders to spend a specified number of hours on a range each year may not be the most practical approach. while the intention behind such a requirement may be to ensure ongoing proficiency and safety, it is important to consider the diverse circumstances and needs of firearm owners.::Requiring a set number of range hours fails to account for the varying availability of ranges across different regions, especially in rural areas where access to suitable facilities may be limited. It may place and undue burden on firearm owners who have limited access to ranges due to geographical constraints or other logistical challenges.::Oversight of Licensing::In the context of licensing considerations, subjecting shooting clubs to authorisation when a firearm is sought on the basis of club membership could create unnecessary barriers for law-abiding citizens who are members of legitimate shooting clubs. It is essential to strike a balance between ensuring safety and preserving the rights and freedoms of responsible firearm owners.::Limited Club Options  Requiring club membership as a prerequisite may limit individuals' choices, especially if there are only a few clubs in a given area. This could create a situation where individuals are forced to join a specific club, regardless of their personal preferences or compatibility with that particular club.::Accessibility and Affordability  Some clubs may have stringent membership requirements or high fees, making it difficult for certain individuals, particularly those from lower-income backgrounds, to access and afford membership. This could disproportionately affect individuals who are interested in legitimate shooting practices but are unable to meet the financial obligations associated with club membership.::Administrative Burden  Implementing and managing a system that requires authorisation through club membership can introduce administrative complexities and increased workload for both clubs and authorities involved in the licensing process. It may require additional resources and monitoring to ensure compliance and proper oversight.::It is important to consider these potential problems and strike a balance between regulating firearm ownership and ensuring accessibility for individuals engaged in legitimate shooting practices.::IFA would not see the merit of introducing specific fees for different forms of clubs. Imposing additional fees could deter individuals from participating in recreational shooting activities and unfairly burden law-abiding citizens who already comply with existing regulations. It is important to promote inclusivity and affordability within the shooting community without introducing unnecessary complexity or financial barriers that could discourage participation in shooting sports.::IFA believe that subjecting clay target shooting and shotgun ranges to inspections may not be the most effective approach for ensuring their safe and responsible operation. Instead of burdening these clubs with additional regulations, a more constructive approach could involve setting guidelines and providing training on how to run an effective clay target club. T::These guidelines can cover essential aspects such as safety protocols, range management, target handling, and proper maintenance of equipment. By focusing on education and training, clubs can develop a culture of safety and responsibility among their members, fostering an environment where best practices are followed and potential risks are minimised.::Additionally, offering resources and support to clubs in implementing these guidelines can further enhance their capacity to maintain high standards of safety and professionalism. This approach recognises the expertise and commitment of clay target shooting and shotgun clubs while providing them with the necessary tools to ensure a safe and enjoyable shooting experience for all members.::IFA would see merit with the recommendation on the topic of electronic registers for Registered Firearm Dealers. Introducing electronic registers would streamline record-keeping processes, enhance efficiency, and ensure accurate and up-to-date information is readily accessible. This move aligns with the digital transformation efforts in various sectors and can contribute to improved regulatory oversight.::While the principle of ensuring safe storage during transportation is important, the additional storage requirements for multiple firearms should be clearly defined. It is crucial to strike a balance between practicality and safety, taking into account the specific circumstances and needs of firearm owners.::To discuss the recommendations put forward by the Firearm Expert Committee (FEC) from an IFA and IFA Countryside point of view through an in-person meeting with the Minister of State at the Department of Justice.",
