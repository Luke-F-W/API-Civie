Further spread of bracken on the mountain should also be prevented.::To highlight that it is imperative that farming and rural communities are supported so that they in turn can support the rural landscape as they are and have been the custodians of the land for generations.::NH1454 Ardee Cutaway Bog  - The  Ardee Cutaway Bog has been proposed as a NHA and yet this is also a proposed route for the Ardee Bypass.  Louth County Council must ensure that farmers in such areas are supported fairly considering the Council's own willingness to overturn such restrictions when concerning their own projects.::Climate Action  On-farm Renewable Energy projects connecting to the grid via the local Substations should be facilitated and encouraged in the new Plan. A further Renewable Energy initiative that would be beneficial for the County Council to action would be the use of Anaerobic Digesters (AD) to treat domestic waste.::Further Louth IFA Proposals  In regard to the N2 Ardee to Castleblaney Road Project, we continue to ask that Louth County Council, Monaghan County Council and Jacobs Consulting Engineers are transparent and fair with affected landowners. Full compensation must be paid in regard to the loss incurred and that the Compulsory Purchase Order (CPO) Goodwill Payment is restored to €5,000 per acre and adhered to.",
