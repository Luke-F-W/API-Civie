Given these students’ care histories, likely potential experiences of trauma, and the many obstacles they will likely have overcome by the time they reach third level education we suggest flexibility and discretion in relation to support::we propose that a designated officer within SUSI be appointed so that Aftercare Workers (and young people) can correspond directly with someone about the specific issues they are facing. In some other areas, for example housing, Aftercare Workers have a person they can contact directly within County Councils when issues arise around a young person’s accommodation.
