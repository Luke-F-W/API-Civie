    "Intended Results":"In the impending remuneration review, the Department may wish to consider extending the types of remuneration permissible to be taken into consideration, e.g. relocation bonuses, daily stipends, allowances etc::The Special Circumstances Permit is an opportunity for the Department to respond to situations that “fall between” the current system.  3.3.\tIt would be useful for the Department to engage with stakeholders as to what jobs might be considered to fall within this permit type.::The current position is that moving an employee to another group company amounts to a breach of the Acts.   Head 12 and Head 25 require further assessment.::The waiver of the 50:50 rule for sole employees is a very welcome development. It isn’t clear if this also applies for renewals, and we would suggest amending Head 26(15) to clarify the position.::The Society notes that Head 15 doesn’t appear to specifically exempt employments over a specified remuneration level from the Labour Market Needs Test.   It may be more appropriate to include that exemption in Head 15 rather than the regulations..::The new provision in Section 17 has the potential to cause issues when considering the interaction between atypical work permits and employment permits.::It isn’t apparent to us why the mere fact that an individual is obtaining a second employment should be a reason for refusal provided the individual meets all other requirements in respect of both applications, particularly where the individual is highly skilled.::It would be helpful if the permit process was revised slightly for applicants who already have a permit. One potential solution would be to extend the period for returning the original permit and making the issuing of the new permission conditional on the return of such permit.::Employees in possession of a critical skills employment permit cannot apply for a Stamp 4 letter until they have been employed for 21 months. However, it is taking a considerable period of time (up to 12 weeks) to receive support letters for Stamp 4 applications. This effectively means that the employee is in limbo until they receive their stamp 4 letter and obtain an appointment with the department, resulting in a risk that the employee will not get an appointment until after expiry  of permit",

IFA believes that, with the increasing scarcity of nursing home beds, particularly in rural Ireland, as well as the desire of older people to remain in their own homes, there is a strong necessity to introduce a Home Support Scheme.::Such a scheme could create a more inclusive, person-centred, and forward-thinking healthcare system. This aligns with the evolving needs and preferences of our ageing population, promoting a culture of care that prioritises individual well-being and autonomy.::To seek a meeting with the Minister of State for Health to discuss the development of a statutory Home Support Scheme to support people to live and be cared for in their home.::To highlight that the Programme for Government commits to 'introduce a statutory scheme to support people to live in their own homes, which will provide equitable access to high-quality, regulated home care'.::To emphasise that a key step in this process is to regulate home support services so that no matter where or how care is provided, service users can be assured that their provider meets minimum standards of quality.::To highlight the advantages of a Home Support Scheme that would play an important role in modern healthcare systems by providing essential care and assistance to individuals in the comfort of their own homes.::The significance of  implementing and maintaining a robust home support scheme cannot be stressed enough;::1. Aging Population::- With aging populations worldwide, there is a growing demand for long-term care services.::- A Home Support Scheme enables elderly individuals to age in place, preserving their independence and dignity.::2. Enhanced Quality of Life::- Home support services contribute to a higher quality of life by allowing individuals to remain in familiar surroundings.::- Personalised care plans cater to the unique needs and preferences of each individual, promoting overall wellbeing.::3. Cost-Effectiveness::- Home-based care is often more cost-effective than institutional care, such as nursing homes and hospitals.::- By preventing unnecessary hospital admissions or readmissions, a home support scheme helps to reduce healthcare expenditures.::4. Family and Community Support::- Home support services alleviate the burden on family caregivers, enabling them to balance caregiving responsibilities with other obligations.::- Individuals receiving home support remain connected to their communities, fostering social integration and support networks.::5. Timely and Flexible Care::- Home support services offer timely and flexible care, adapting to individuals' changing needs over time.::- This flexibility accommodates diverse schedules and preferences, ensuring that individuals receive the right level of care when they need it.::6. Preventative Health Measures::- Home support workers can implement preventative health measures, such as medication management and fall prevention strategies, reducing the risk of adverse health events.::To emphasise that it is important that the new Home Support Scheme will be integrated with other healthcare and social care services to provide person-centred care. It is also important that the planned statutory scheme be complimentary to, and supportive of, the provision of care by the families and other unpaid carers.::To highlight that it is important for everyone to have access to an affordable, universal, single-tiered healthcare system, and that the design of the new home support will aim to ensure that cost is not a barrier to accessing services. People should be supported to live at home and to receive the required care and support in their own home or as close to home as possible.::For vulnerable groups such as the elderly and those living with disabilities, reducing the use of residential care in favour of a 'home first' approach is beneficial. Keeping people in their homes should have benefits for patient health and wellbeing, and it may also serve to reduce the demand on long term residential care and acute hospital facilities.::To highlight that with the projected increase in our ageing population, it is necessary to prepare for the increasing demand for homecare and home support services in our communities.",
