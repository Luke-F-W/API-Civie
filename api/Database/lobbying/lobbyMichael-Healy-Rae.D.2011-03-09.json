The UK and Ireland have identical tobacco control policies, except for the approach to e-cigarettes, which is open in the UK and very skeptical in Ireland. Ireland should follow the UK approach if it wants to accelerate the decline in smoking incidence.::Highlight the conclusions of the House of Commons Science and Technology Committee report on e-cigarettes, which overwhelmingly concludes that not only are e-cigarettes substantially less harmful than traditional cigarettes but that they can be used to significantly reduce smoking rates.",
