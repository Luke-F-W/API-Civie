    "Intended Results":"The Society focused on four key areas in making this submission,  1. Looking after those most in need.  2. Keeping Competitive and Growing.  3. Administrative and technical issues which have been raised previously, and 4.  The manner in which the Finance Bill and related legislation is introduced.::Qualifying benefits of permanently disabled individuals:  The Society recommended a reversion to the original application of Section 84 of the Capital Acquisitions Tax Consolidation Act, 2003 in respect of qualifying benefits of permanently disabled individuals.::That there is an anomaly regarding the taxation of financial dependant cohabitants,  where provision is made either by agreement or by a court order. Effectively, the current legislation encourages parties to litigate as the tax treatment is less onerous on those who proceed to Court, rather than through agreement. We see no policy rationale for the distinction.::In respect of Fair Deal:  In calculating the assets of a person applying under the Fair Deal scheme a percentage of the capital value of their house is taken into account for the first three years.  We would recommend that where a house which would qualify as a principal private residence is sold then where the sales proceeds are retained the Fair Deal applicant should be assessed on the same basis as if the house had not been sold.::A penalty exists for co-habitants where the co-owner dies:  Section 52 of the Finance Act, 2016 effectively removed the relief from all inter vivos transactions, save to a “dependant relative” as defined. As a result, qualified cohabitants continue to be excluded from the relief inter vivos and the dwelling that both live in can only pass on death.::Higher tax on qualified co-habitants on inheritances:  should a qualified cohabitant fail utterly to provide for a surviving qualified cohabitant, any application by the qualified cohabitant for provision under s. 194 of the Civil Partnership Act, 2010 will pass free from CAT. This has the outcome of encouraging a qualified cohabitant to fail to make proper provision as litigation will result in the surviving qualified cohabitant receiving proper provision free from CAT.",

    "Subject Matter":"Benefit-in-kind on professional subscriptions",
    "Intended Results":"In eBrief No. 04\/18 Revenue updated their guidance for the interpretation of section 114 TCA 1997 in relation to professional membership fees. Revenue’s position on the ‘wholly, exclusive and necessarily” test is stricter than that set out in previous guidance.::The circumstances in which professional fees are viewed by Revenue as incurred ‘wholly, exclusive and necessarily’ in the carrying on of an office or employment are (1) where there is a statutory requirement for membership of a professional body or to hold a practising certificate and (2) where statutory provisions must restrict the ability of an individual to fulfil the full duties of an office or employment unless they are members of a relevant professional body.::The new Guidance does not taken into account the maintenance and promotion of standards, education and the continuing professional development of the professional sector by professional bodies. Payment of membership fees to a professional body and completion of continuous professional development is often a requirement of the professional body in order for an individual to maintain their professional qualification.::Revenue’s position on second or more memberships penalises the employee or office holder who wishes to boost their skillset with a second relevant qualification in their chosen field and who is paying a subscription fee in relation to that qualification. There is a concern that Revenue’s new guidance may lead to a decline in membership of professional bodies.::By way of comparison in the UK, a statutory list of approved professional bodies is maintained whereby subscriptions to such bodies are not treated as a taxable benefit if paid by an employer and if the activities of the body are of direct benefit to, or concern the profession practiced in, in the performance of the duties of the employment.::The stricter interpretation of the wholly, exclusive and necessarily test in relation to professional subscriptions is not welcomed by the Law Society nor is the apparent narrow view taken by Revenue on subscriptions paid to two or more professional bodies. Our tax system should help rather than hinder the development of an educated and skilled workforce in order to attract inward investment to Ireland.",
    "Lobbying Activities":"The Society was signatory to the publication 'Building Ireland's Future - The Role of the Professions'; which detailed the value of the professions and underlined the importance of a practical approach to the tax treatment of subscriptions of professional bodies. \n\nSee the full submission at: https:\/\/lawsociety.ie\/policyandlawreform|Submission|1",

    "Subject Matter":"Renewables Submission - Budget 2019",
    "Intended Results":"To highlight that IFA sees a role for farmers in achieving the targets set down in the EU Energy Directive which mandates Ireland to achieve 16% of our energy requirements from renewable sources, by 2020.::That farmers could achieve these targets through farm-scale, community or farmer-led Renewable Electricity Projects (REE) projects.::That IFA's proposals for REE projects would be taken on board as follows:::* Feed-In Tariffs - proposed price support bidding process put forward by the Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment is not suitable for REE projects. Such projects would not have the economies of scale to successfully compete in a competitive bidding process.::In order to deliver on Government’s ambition of promoting economic development and supporting community and citizen participation in the transition to a low carbon economy it is essential such projects are not part of the competitive bidding process. A guaranteed Feed-In Tariff must be delivered.  The generation Feed-In Tariff should be 17c\/kWh, guaranteed for 20 years and linked to CPI. An increased generation Feed-In Tariff for roof mounted solar projects, should also be introduced.::* Technology specific base price::Current renewables policy supports a least cost and technology neutral approach to the delivery of renewable energy in Ireland. This is not compatible with Government’s energy policy objective of broadening and diversifying the renewable technology mix and cannot be achieved if there is a continuation of the least cost strategy, which has resulted in vast disruption to rural communities and the reliance on a single technology, large scale on-shore wind.::The IFA does not support the proposal to hold technology neutral auctions. Instead the process should include a guaranteed base price for REE projects, and discriminate in favour of alternative energy sources including solar, hydro and anaerobic digestion.::To deliver on the Government’s high-level commitment of supporting REE projects, a budget of €100m should be ring-fenced from the current PSO levy funds collected. This represents approximately one-fifth of the overall budget. This ring-fencing should also be extended beyond total capacity of each auction, to include ring fencing at connection point (substation etc) to include REE projects.::* Grid connection policy::Grid connection policy should be linked directly with landowners who gave the original permission for the grid connection application to be made. This would prohibit speculative trading of grid connections.::The proposal to universally impose bid bonds or penalties should be reviewed, as it would be a disproportionate cost burden for certain projects. For REE projects, the proposal for bid bonds and penalties should be removed as this requirement may act as a barrier to adoption.::* Opportunities for micro-energy generation::The development of a micro-generation renewables sector in Ireland will support the rural economy and also provide an opportunity for a wider number of citizens to displace their fossil fuel use. There is need for a budget and implementation timeframe for micro-generation, in line with Government policy.::A clear statement of intent is required for micro-energy generation, which includes: •\tA ring-fenced budget from the PSO levy •\tTimeframe for implementation  •\tPlanning and development charges exemption for all farm-scale renewable projects •\tGrid connection preference and waivering of connection costs for farm-scale projects::* Financial supports for community-led projects::The provision of finance for REE projects will be essential to support early stage adoption. This must be complemented by the introduction of a robust Feed-In Tariff structure, which includes an increased tariff REE projects and roof-mounted solar projects.   There would also be an on-going requirement for the terms and cost finance to be monitored, to ensure the project financing costs remain competitive.::The terms of existing investment mechanisms, such as the Employment and Investment Incentive Scheme, should be tailored to accommodate the inclusion of investments for REE projects.::* Community participation in renewable energy::Community participation in renewable energy production must be at the centre of future Government policy. To achieve this IFA proposes an additional generation Feed-In Tariff of 2.5c\/kWh, in addition to the standard generation Feed-In Tariff.::REE projects, grid access and electricity infrastructure costs should be waivered and grid access should be ring-fenced. Furthermore such projects should be supported through the innovation process through the provision of information and advice to help guide and assist projects during uncertainty.::In addition, a requirement for an annual community contribution during the duration of large-scale renewable projects should be mandatory and legislated for. This contribution should be the greater of 1.5% of turnover or €2\/MWh. This annual contribution should be used to support rural regeneration, working closely with initiatives such as the LEADER programme.",
