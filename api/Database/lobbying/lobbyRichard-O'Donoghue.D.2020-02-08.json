It is critical for the sector, that the shelf space which has been hard won in the major retailers in the UK is safeguarded for Irish product. A situation cannot be allowed arise where through market disruption or administrative delays that Irish beef loses any of this market share.::In addition, the EU market must function to support Irish and EU beef farmers. Current beef imports from Mercosur countries of circa 250,000t should be stopped immediately. This is consistent with the recent vote in the EU Parliament against ratification of the EU-Mercosur trade agreement.   In any on-going negotiations with third countries, EU market access for sensitive products must be off the table.",
