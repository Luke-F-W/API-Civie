These include the exclusion of setback areas in commercial forests and the proposed seven-year eco-scheme system payment, which is much too short.::To highlight that the scheme overall is very disappointing especially for commercial forests where a setback will apply, and the area is not included in this scheme.::To emphasise that the proposed seven-year payments for ecosystems are far too short and should be extended.::Ash Dieback::To emphasise that an urgent Roadside Ash Dieback Scheme is needed to safely removed diseased trees. As it is a costly and dangerous operation, farmers need support to provide traffic management during felling, and financial support to engage suitably qualified professionals to safely fell trees.::Bark Beetle::To highlight that, while measures are currently in place to prevent an outbreak of Spruce Bark Beetle, the effectiveness of these measures must be scrutinised and it must be a priority to avoid another devastating blow to the forestry sector.::To meet with MEP's to discuss the ongoing issues in Farm Forestry.",
