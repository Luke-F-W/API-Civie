However, in the past number of months, it has been brought to IFA's attention that items the VAT could previously be reclaimed upon, such as automatic calf feeders, robotic scraping systems, drafting gates and bulk milk tanks, have now been refused refunds by Revenue. This change in the interpretation of the relevant legislation has been abrupt and without any communication or engagement.::To challenge this change in interpretation of the S.I. by Revenue, which is causing major issues at farm level. For many farmers such large capital expenditure is financed by bank lending, and the amount financed would be the VAT exclusive amount because of the expectation that the VAT incurred would be refunded.::To highlight that these farmers now face the situation where the amount borrowed no longer covers the expenditure incurred and may struggle to find further finance to fill this shortfall. In addition, many who had planned expenditure on such items are now reconsidering such expenditure due to this extra cost.::That the issue this change of interpretation is also causing, is with the Targeted Agriculture Modernisation Schemes (TAMS) grant funding. The ceilings for items under TAMS are set as the VAT exclusive amount in most instances, again with the expectation that the VAT incurred would be refunded. If as it appears this is no longer the case for such items, then the ceiling for those items needs to be adjusted up accordingly and further funding allocated to the TAMS.::To request a meeting with the Minister for Finance to engage further on this issue.",
