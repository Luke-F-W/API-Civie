    "Subject Matter":"Agri Taxation - IFA 2017 Budget Submission",
    "Intended Results":"To tackle income volatility:::- Extension of income averaging where farmer’s spouse is self-employed -  where a spouse of a farmer has a fully separable source of income from self-employment, income averaging should be allowed on the farm profits.::- Individualising income averaging through temporary opt-out - that a farmer on income averaging is permitted, in a year when farm income falls significantly, to pay the tax due for a single year only on the actual income earned in that year, rather than the average tax due arising from the previous five years’ income. The underpayment of tax in that year would be carried forward and paid over a three year period.::Over a five year period, the farmer would have the option of using his actual income as the basis for his tax payment on two occasions.::While the scheduling\/timing of the tax payment would differ, the total amount paid to the Revenue Commissioners would remain the same. The farmer would pay higher tax in the years following the opt-out, than if he had not opted out, but this should be at a time of higher income, and therefore greater ability to meet this tax payment::Removing discrimination in the income tax system - Earned Income Tax Credit - with reference to the commitment in the Programme for Government to increase the Earned Income Tax Credit from €550 to €1,650 for the self-employed, to match the PAYE credit, by 2018. Given the positive exchequer returns in 2016, there is scope to introduce this for 2017 in October’s budget.::Farm Transfer and Restructuring - Agricultural Relief and CAT Values - that the retention of 90% Agricultural and Business Relief is critical to support the transfer of family farms and other small businesses. In addition, to ensure that farms of a viable size can continue be transferred, IFA supports the commitment in the Programme for Government to increase the Category A threshold (parent and child) in future budgets.::CGT Restructuring Relief - that the CGT Restructuring Relief measure should be extended past the current expiry date of end 2016. While recognising that it is a measure that applies to a small number of farmers, its retention is important.  Where the opportunity arises to restructure a farm through land disposal and re-purchase, it is of huge benefit to that individual, and can significantly improve both the financial and environmental efficiency of that holding.::Stamp Duty Consanguinity Relief for Registered Farm Partnerships - that stamp duty consanguinity relief (1% stamp duty) is extended to farm transfers that are undertaken within the structure of a Registered Farm Partnership.::Land Leasing tax exemption between siblings - that the land leasing tax exemption scheme should be extended to leases between siblings, but with restrictions in place to ensure that it continues to be used in genuine circumstances only.::In particular, IFA proposes that where the lease is between siblings, only one sibling can avail of the income tax exemption – i.e. there can be no situation whereby two farmer siblings lease land to each other and avail of the income tax exemption.::CGT Relief on Farm Partnership dissolution - that, in order to continue to encourage farmers to enter into farm partnerships,  the Joint Tenancy Ownership Relief from Capital Gain Tax that was available until December 2013, where there was the dissolution of a farm partnership, should be reinstated.::Aquaculture – implementing the proposals of the marine taxation review -that the extension of Agricultural Relief to the marine sector, including aquaculture, must be implemented in Budget 2017.::Farm Investment - Accelerated Capital Allowance for investment in energy efficient equipment - that the extension of the SEAI accelerated capital allowances scheme for investment in energy efficient equipment to sole traders, as proposed in the Agri-taxation review 2014 and Marine Taxation Review 2016, would be a progressive move to encourage on-farm investments and improve the overall efficiency of farming enterprises.::Incentivising farm level renewable energy initiatives:::For farmland used for solar power generation, - that land leased on a long-term basis to a solar panel enterprise, where the land is also used in the trade of farming, must qualify for the income tax exemption for long term leasing of farmland::- Where the lease concludes and reverts to the original farmer, CGT Retirement Relief and Agricultural Relief must apply on transfer of the land, subject to the other qualifying conditions being satisfied::- •\tWhere the farmer installs the solar panels on his land and continues to farm the land around the panels (does not lease the land out), this land will qualify for CGT Retirement Relief and Agricultural Relief upon transfer::To further encourage farm-based renewable energy initiatives IFA proposes:  A generation feed-in tariff must be introduced for farm-scale renewable energy production, in particular solar, wind and Anaerobic Digestion::- Investment in  farm-scale renewable energy  initiatives must qualify under the EIIS scheme;::- Income received for the alternative use of farmland for renewable energy projects should receive an income tax exemption, if such income is used for the purposes of re-investment in the farm business; and::- Revenue from the Carbon tax should be ring-fenced for re-investment in and support of renewable energy initiatives.::Changes to excise and licensing regime for small scale cider production:::- that the upper excise band for cider should be removed. The result would be a single rate of duty of €94.46\/hectolitre, for all ciders of volume from 2.8%-8.5%;::- an Artisan Cider Manufacturers License should be established for annual production quantities up to 1,000 hL. Such a license would permit both retail and wholesale sales.::Apprenticeship tax credit - that incentives through the tax system are provided for small business employers who take on apprentices in an approved programme. This would be in the form of an income tax credit similar to the Apprenticeship Job Creation Tax Credit  scheme currently operating in Canada.::Rejuvenating rural towns and villages:::Support for the proposal in the Programme for Government to introduce a new and improved Town and Villages Renewal Scheme in this year’s budget.::New business start-ups should receive an exemption from rates for an initial time period and with a continuation of the three year tax exemption for start -up companies::•\tWhere businesses establish in rural villages and town centres, they should be eligible to claim double income tax relief on their rental expenditure for their premises.",

    "Subject Matter":"Sheep Sector - Inputs Inflation.",
    "Intended Results":"To highlight that the production cost increases sheep farmers are now exposed to have very serious consequences for the sector. It is a vulnerable low-income sector dependent on direct payments for over 100% of Family Farm Income (FFI). To this end, there is an immediate need for interventions to support sheep farmers.::To highlight that the updated Situation and Outlook report issued by Teagasc clearly identifies the seriousness of the situation. The average income on sheep farms in 2022 is forecast to reduce by 20%, based on increased production costs of 30%.::To highlight the measures IFA sees necessary to address these issues on farms which will allow sheep farmers put in place their plans for the year ahead.  These are as follows::1.\tAvailability of key inputs such as fertiliser, fuel and feed.::2.\tAll land must be utilised to produce food. Restrictions on land use under schemes must be removed to ensure farmers are facilitated in using all lands at their disposal to produce food. These include areas such as traditional hay meadows and low input grasslands in the GLAS scheme.  •\tTraditional hay meadows::o\tThe facilitation for grazing must be extended past the 15th April to allow farmers utilise the potential of all grasslands at their disposal.::o\tFarmers must be allowed cut the meadows prior to the 1st July to maximise the quality of the crop and facilitate earlier utilisation of the lands afterwards.::o\tThe limits on chemical fertiliser usage must be increased.::•\tLow input grasslands.::o\tFarmers must be allowed harvest hay and or silage on these lands.::o\tThe limits on chemical fertiliser usage must be removed.::•\tEmergency Catch\/Fodder Crop Incentive.::o\tIn order to maximise the amount of fodder produced in 2022, all options including fodder and cover crops must be implemented. The emergency tillage incentive is a welcome and timely initiative but livestock farmers with poor or limited access to machinery may not be in a position to plant tillage crops but the planting of temporary fodder or catch crops into grassland later in the season could be more feasible.::o\tFodder crop establishment in the late summer\/early autumn may also provide a good opportunity for efficient use of slurry if available on farm.::o\tA significant area of fodder or catch crops could be planted for grazing by sheep and lambs later in the season if financial incentives were available.::o\tThe fodder incentive scheme launched in response to the drought event in 2018 was successful with almost 20,000ha of catch crops planted. With significant concerns over the cost and availability of imported concentrate feeds in the second half of this year and as yet an unknown quantity of silage harvested, IFA believes a similar incentive should be given serious consideration by the Department of Agriculture, Food & Marine.::o\tA payment of at least €300\/ha for the establishment and production of catch crops such as, but not limited to  kale, forage rape, tillage radish, redstart, Tyfon hybrid turnip.::o\tThis level of payment would be required to cover the significantly elevated fertiliser and fuel costs that farmers are currently experiencing.::o\tCrops should be sown to ensure a worthwhile yield of biomass is produced before winter.::3.\tDirect financial support to sheep farmers.::o\tImmediate direct financial supports must be provided to farmers to offset the increased costs for feed, fertiliser and fuel on sheep farms.::o\tThese supports must be paid directly to farmers based on their level of production.::o\tThe updated Teagasc Situation and Outlook report identifies the levels of input cost increases for sheep farmers and should be used as the basis to determine the levels of direct financial support per farm.::o\tThese payments must be provided without condition in order to allow each farmer address the situation on his\/her farm that best suits the farm enterprise and land type.::The crisis fund of up to €48m which the Commission have provided €16m towards and allowed flexibility for 200% national co-financing must be used as part of these supports for sector.::4.\tGuaranteed support for farmers investing in sheep production for the remainder of the year and into 2023. It is vital sheep farmers continue to finish lambs and hoggets in line with our well-established production systems. These practices require upfront investment in animals and feed which in normal times carries a degree of risk. This risk is now at levels that are not sustainable for the low margin sheep sector.::There is a real concern the trade of store lambs will be severely disrupted and in turn our supply chain for sheep meat if there is a failure to put guarantees in place for farmers who ordinarily finish lambs for this Autumn and into 2023. Direct financial supports and guaranteed price returns must be committed to for these farmers to ensure production continues as normal for the remainder of the year and into 2023.::5.\tFood security must be protected and food producers valued.::The direction of travel of policy makers at EU and national level has failed EU consumers and EU farmers. The relentless pursuit of a cheap food policy; erosion of supports for food production; and the trade-off of Irish and EU farmers in trade deals for the benefit of large corporations and industrialists has undermined Irish and EU food sovereignty.::The CAP, Green Deal and Farm to Fork have further undermined the ability of Irish and EU farmers to produce food. The damage done to productive farmers in these flawed policies must be reversed.::Irish and EU farmers must be supported directly for the production of food based on their levels of production. EU and national policy must value the vital role of farmers in providing security of food for the citizens of the EU, food which is produced to the highest environmental and welfare standards in the world. Sheep farmers must be provided with €30\/ewe payment in the Strategic Plans for the new CAP.::Trade deals cannot be allowed undermine the viability of Irish and EU farmers by facilitating access for sheep meat produced outside of the EU and at differing production systems that do not meet the exacting welfare and environmental standards of Irish and EU sheep farmers.",

    "Intended Results":"Diversify Ireland’s agricultural system and support an expeditious and comprehensive implementation of the Green Deal, including Farm to Fork and Biodiversity Strategies. We must shift towards environmentally and socially sustainable farming practices. This is the only path that ensures long-term food security, and food sovereignty, while reducing our exposure to risks and external shocks.::The global food system will continue to suffer from crises and uncertainties as we weather the impacts of climate change over the coming years and decades. By acting now, to reduce greenhouse gas emissions within our agricultural sector we can positively contribute to the resilience of global food systems.::Ensure a Just Transition for Irish farmers. Farmers must be supported and incentivised to move to more sustainable agricultural practices9::The horticultural and tillage sectors have been badly neglected and would benefit from a renewed emphasis on the prosperity of their sectors. There must be greater equity in the opportunities and responsibilities associated with the transition to a more sustainable food system.::Now is the time to plan for the reduction in the dairy and beef herds. The reintroduction of dairy quotas at an Irish or EU level would contribute to this goal, as would limits on fertiliser usage that are in line with environmental carrying capacity. In that context, the government should withdraw its application for a new Nitrates Derogation and introduce a permitting system for intensive dairy and beef farming, similar to that for pigs and poultry.::A renewed focus must be placed on farming systems which are less dependent on synthetic pesticides and fertilisers. Greater support is needed for regenerative agriculture, organics, nutrient management planning, and multi-species swards.::Ensure no reductions \/ conversion of areas and habitats for biodiversity in current RDP and future CAP (2023-2027).",

    "Subject Matter":"Food Supply Chain Bill 2022 - Pre Legislative Scrutiny of the Agricultural & Food Supply Chain Bill",
    "Intended Results":"IFA seeks the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine to state that the focus of attention of this Office will be on the actors at the top of the Food Chain; the main retailers of food in Ireland today. These are the actors that hold the buying power and have distorted the market against the primary producer. • Make available analysis of information on price and market data in the agricultural and food supply chain in Ireland::IFA requests that the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine clearly enshrines the reporting requirements on a regular basis. IFA suggests monthly reports publicised with at least quarterly information seminars (online & in-person) to assist in dissemination the data to stakeholders down the food chain.::This analysis should also include data on percentage share of the food value chain that is returning to the primary producer. • Encourage, enforce and investigate compliance with the rules on unfair trading practices provided for by or under this Bill.::The focus should be clearly stated that the new Office will tackle the stakeholders with the greatest power i. e. the main retailers, in the supply chain, not the smaller buyers, as a priority. • Bring summary proceedings for offences under this Bill;::IFA seeks full powers of entry and investigation as outlined under this Bill to be used by all agents of the new office in bringing investigations and proceedings before the Courts. 9 The Bill gives very substantial powers to agents working for the new office. The Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine must get assurance from the Minister for Justice and the Garda Commissioner, that every support from An Garda Siochana will be given, when required to assist in investigations.::Board and Membership -  The Bill outlines that the Board will consist of a Chairperson and five ordinary members, two of whom shall be primary producers. IFA seeks the expansion of this board to at least 5 primary producer members to allow greater representation. The elected President of the IFA should be allocated the first primary producers' board seat. The primary producers' members should not have conflicted interests in other sectors of the food chain such as food processing or retailing::Committees - IFA welcomes the inclusion of the provision to establish necessary committees. IFA suggest that vulnerable sectors that are in severe decline due to their reliance on the domestic retail sector, must have representative committees established as a priority. Primary producers, independent advisory experts, Teagasc, Bord Bia and IFA staff should be considered in nominating membership of such committees.::Other agri-sectors which have a larger dependency on exports market should also have committee representation. However, the priority is the fresh produce sectors that are being squeezed out of existence by big retailers.::Office Engagement of Expert Consultants and Advisors - IFA encourages the practice of seeking the most suitable qualified expertise when and where needed. When setting baseline costs of production, IFA encourages the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine to recommend that the Office engage with both Teagasc and UCD School of Agriculture and Food Science. Additional recognised expertise should be engaged when and where needed::Complaints to Office -  IFA is the only farmer representative body representing all agri-sectors, and the only representative body for the most vulnerable sectors which are dealing directly and the most reliant on retailers. This includes fruit and vegetable growers, liquid milk producers and pig and poultry farmers. The fear factor of making a formal complaint to the new office is a real barrier to suppliers making formal complaints Anonymity is fundamental to the success of this legislation.::IFA propose that Bill Head 38 Complaints, 3(b) is reworded to the following  ‘Other organisations that have a legitimate interest in representing suppliers shall have the right to submit complaints, provided that such organisations are independent non-profit-making legal persons.::This is required to encourage those that believe they are being negatively affected by more dominant buyers in the food chain and subject to UTPs'.::(Removing “at the request of a supplier, and in the interest of that supplier”)  (9) Where the Office considers that there are insufficient grounds for acting on a complaint, it shall inform the complainant in writing of the reasons within a reasonable period of time after the receipt of the complaint. (Inclusion of in writing)::Prohibition on Unfair Trading Practices – Regulation Additions to Head 39 - 39. (1) A person shall not engage in an unfair trading practice prohibited by or under this Bill. (2) Where the Minister considers it to be appropriate having regard to::IFA Additions  (i) to the viability of the primary producer (m) there is a risk of the continued supply of Irish produced food The Minister may, having consulted with the Commission of the European Union, by Regulations prohibit certain trading practices in business-to-business relationships in the agricultural and food supply chain (referred to as an “unfair trading practice”) where such practice::(iv) undermines the viability of the primary producer (v) puts the supply of seasonality available Irish food at risk.::Engagement with Suppliers IFA call on the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine to include in the regulations a stipulation that dominant retail buyers must engage with their suppliers when in receipt of written\/email requests. Where requests to review terms of supply contacts, the supplier must be afforded the opportunity to outline supply issues to the more dominant retail buyer in the food chain.::IFA is aware of numerous incidents in 2022 where suppliers of agri-food have failed to get any engagement with their retail buyer regarding both ongoing supply contacts and contracts that were nearing renewal date. This must be clearly defined as a UTP and subject to severe repercussions when found to be used as a delaying tactic by dominant retail buyers.::Head 44 Agri-food Regulations 44. (1) The Minister may make regulations relating to, or for the purpose of— IFA additional wording  (j) the collection of price at all stages in the food supply chain and market information to address issues of lack of transparency and information asymmetry in the food supply chain.::Head 52 Fines and Penalties 52. (1) A person who commits an offence under section 29(3) is liable, on summary conviction, to a class A fine. (2) A person who commits an offence under sections 48(11) or 49(1) (a) is liable, on summary conviction, to a class A fine or imprisonment for a term not exceeding 6 months, or to both, or (b) is liable, on conviction on indictment, to a fine not exceeding €500,000 or imprisonment for a term not exceeding 3 years, or to both.::IFA propose a much higher limit of €4million or 4% of annual turnover, whichever is higher. This would coincide with similar penalty criteria as set out by the GDPR legislation. IFA consider the upper limit of €500,000 on summary conviction too low in the context of the annual turnover of the largest most, dominant stakeholders in the food chain.::Head 55 Fixed payment notice (2) An officer who receives a report under subsection (1), if he or she considers it appropriate, may serve on the person a notice in writing (“fixed payment notice”) stating that— (b) the person may during the period of 28 days beginning on the date of the notice made to the Minister, at the address specified in the notice, a payment of €250 (or such other amount, being an amount not exceeding €1,000,::as stands specified by order made, from time to time, by the Minister and different amounts may be specified in respect of different offences) accompanied by the notice. IFA consider the Fixed payment of up to €1000 as too low in the context of the offence and damage to the supply of food. For payment of a fixed charge notice, an upper limit of €100,000 and a lower amount of €2,500 should be imposed in the Bill.::Head 56 Fees 56. (1) Subject to subsection (2), for the purpose of meeting expenses properly incurred by the Office in the due performance of its functions under this Bill, the Minister, with the consent of the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, may make regulations imposing fees to be paid by a person making a complaint under this Bill.::IFA considers it unnecessary and a deterrent to the success of this bill to have a legislative ability to impose fees to be paid by a person making a complaint under this Bill. This provision should be removed.::Alternative Dispute Resolution IFA seeks the office to intervene as a first step and use its powers given in this Bill to investigate and apply sanctions if deemed necessary as first practice. Alternative dispute resolution can have a useful role especially between stakeholders that are more closely aligned in terms of power in the food chain, size and non-dependency on one party or the other.",

The use of electroejaculation is a successful method of collecting semen samples from breeding males which has been used across the world for decades.::The use of electroejaculation is a succes It should be noted, breeding males are some of the most valuable animals on farms and farmers clearly would not continue to avail of this collection method if there existed any concerns for the well-being of the animal at any point in the process. Determining the fertility of breeding males is a vital management practice for farmers. Access to a competitive semen collection system to inform this must be maintained.::- It is extremely dangerous to reach firm conclusions that would impede access to this important service for farmers and breeders based on the limited research available in relation to EEJ and the less than conclusive outcomes of this research.::- It should also be noted a large amount of the research referred to could be described, at best, as dated. Advances in the equipment used and the competence of current operators must form the basis of determining the appropriate path forward as opposed to dated and limited research.::- Alternative methods of collecting semen referred to in the research all have shortcomings in terms of efficacy, operator safety and animal welfare.::- Given that there is no safer or comparable alternative method of semen collection than the use of EEJ, it is vital that access to this on farm method of sample collection continues to be competitively available to farmers.::- Placing this method of sample collection under veterinary supervision would place an unnecessary additional cost on farmers. Additionally, the availability of large animal veterinary services is already a major concern for farmers throughout the country. IFA members are increasingly highlighting extended waiting times for veterinary call outs around the country and have raised concerns around potential animal welfare issues caused by these delays.::It would be impractical and disproportionate to require veterinary supervision to this practice.::- An accredited training course to train technicians who provide this service to farmers is an appropriate approach to addressing the lack of regulation around the use of EEJ in Ireland. This approach would ensure the most up to date and appropriate techniques are always used, reducing the likelihood of any potential discomfort.::- It should also be considered allowing only the use of the most suitable EEJ equipment recognising advances in the development of the technologies available.::- It is important that this safe, efficient on farm management tool continues to be competitively available to farmers through competent service providers who are accredited trained individuals using the most appropriate equipment available.",

    "Subject Matter":"National Bioeconomy Action Plan",
    "Intended Results":"IFA propose that:::- Income generating potential from natural resources must be maximised.::- The development of the bioeconomy must be complementary to, and not in competition with, high quality food production.::- Clear objectives prioritising the bioeconomy strategy's contribution to jobs and economic activity in rural areas must be set out.::- The available biomass streams must be used with higher value-added potential and given preference within the bioeconomy framework.::- Resource efficiency recycling should be optimised, where possible.::IFA proposes these specific measures::1. Establishment of measurable targets -::The National Bioeconomy Action Plan should set out clear and measurable targets (in the short and long term) related to income generation, employment and regional distribution of bio-based businesses. Clearly defined objectives and guiding principles will be essential to enable those working in the bioeconomy sectors to achieve goals and allow progress to be assessed::- Income generating potential from natural resources must be maximised.::- The development of the bioeconomy must be complementary to, and not in competition with, high quality food production (as per guiding principle set out in National Policy Statement on the Bioeconomy::- Clear objectives prioritising the bioeconomy strategy's contribution to jobs and economic activity in rural areas must be set out.::- The available biomass streams must be used with higher value-added potential and given preference within the bioeconomy framework.::- Resource efficiency recycling should be optimised, where possible. 2. Public::2. Public awareness campaign for farmers::- A targeted information campaign to promote greater awareness and understanding of the potential of the bioeconomy should be developed for farmers. The goal should be that farmers are better informed about bioenergy and biobased business, its benefits, challenges and the opportunities that it presents.::- Given the complexity of the bioeconomy such a campaign is key to developing a knowledge-based dialogue between farmers and consumers to strengthen understanding of the potential of biobased products in Ireland. The campaign should also be used to provide an opportunity to establish new networks and connections, both regionally and nationally, between organisations, industries and the supply chain to assist in the development of the bioeconomy.::- IFA would propose holding a national conference targeted at farmers to discuss the potential of the bioeconomy, the opportunities and the supports that are available to interested stakeholders. It would also provide an opportunity to showcase existing agri-businesses that are forging ahead in the bioeconomy in Ireland.::3. Demonstration projects::- Although knowledge and technical potential of the bioeconomy has increased in recent years, significant gaps exist. Valorisation and demonstration projects should be supported to make the transition from research to production possible. These demonstration projects or models of best practice will create confidence in the market and encourage further investment.::An example of such a project could be the establishment of a smaller-scale bio-refinery demonstration facility to produce citric acid, bioethanol, or other chemicals from crops such as barley and wheat. This would underpin greater confidence in the Irish tillage sector which is targeted for growth under the Irish Climate Action Plan::- On farm demonstration projects into crops and new farming systems to optimise yield of biomass must be supported. The funding programme must support the transition into practice by funding activities in plant production, agricultural technology and logistical networks.::- The demonstration projects should also support on farm or community level development of business model innovations that link production cycles and by products from agriculture, forestry and aquaculture sectors to the most appropriate bioenergy and biobased products markets. This may require the establishment of collaboration networks between producers and relevant stakeholders.::4. Sustainable biomass production::- Sustainable management of agriculture, forests and aquaculture is a basic prerequisite for providing most of the raw materials for the bioeconomy. The IFA led resource efficiency initiative, Smart Farming, focuses on improving farm returns while enhancing the rural environment. By developing resource management and operating resources efficiently, agricultural production can be increased whilst also benefiting the environment::The policy must address the growing demand for biomass and the projected shortfall in biomass resources, by introducing new of measures or amending existing measures to increase biomass production, these include::- The re-introduction of an improved Bioenergy Scheme (BES) with additional energy crops supported under the scheme.::- Remove restrictions on planting productive marginal land to address the falling afforestation programme. COFORD Land Availability Working Group identified 180,000 hectares of land technically suitable for forestry that is currently restricted from the forestry programme.::- The introduction of appropriate funding to support Producer Organisations to establish regional and national networks, creating the necessary economies of scale to optimise efficiency in the supply chain.::5. Biomass market development::- The Bioeconomy Action Plan should set out clear targets and measures to stimulate market demand in the bioeconomy, if farmers are to invest in the necessary infrastructure to develop sustainable supply chains. The development of the bioenergy sector in Ireland has been thwarted by the lack of a Bioenergy Plan and adequate supports to stimulate market development. It is essential that the Government introduce appropriate supports through the following measures::- Develop a National Bioenergy Plan so farmers have confidence to invest.::- Introduce a Renewable Heat Obligation scheme (RHO) with attractive subsidies as soon as possible to support the wide scale deployment of biomass production. This will give greater certainty and security of revenue for farmer led projects.::- Provide capital grant funding to farmers and forest owners to establish biomass energy supply companies\/organisations to develop, build and operate biomass-based energy systems in order to meet the biomethane climate targets, as set out in the Climate Action Plan 2023::- Streamline current regulations to support the development of AD plants, particularly a small scale on-farm AD plant.::6. Biomass trade and logistics centres::- The development of regional biomass trade and logistic centres (BTLC) that optimise the sustainable mobilisation of Ireland's biomass resources and improve the economic effectiveness of production, must be a key priority in the policy statement.::- The establishment of robust biomass supply chains is one of the biggest challenges to provide the required network spread of centres where potential customers can be guaranteed a quality supply over the long-term. Farmers must be supported to optimise logistics and trading to enable different biomass fuels (firewood, chips, straw, energy crops etc.) to be collectively marketed at a guaranteed quality and price.::A funding programme must be introduced to create end user confidence that a sustainable long-term supply of biobased products is available; therefore, the programme must support the following::- The development and coordination of farmer producer organisations to facilitate collective supply of biomass.::- The purchase and construction of essential infrastructure such as specialised harvesting, processing and transport machinery, storage and drying units, fuel quality measurement equipment and weighbridge and other infrastructure.::7. Training and development programmes::Ireland needs to build up and expand the expertise necessary for the bioeconomy, a network of specialised personnel including farmers need to be educated. Existing training programmes need to be adapted and new programmes introduced to inform farmers about new innovations to increase production, alternative crops or technologies to increase efficiencies on farms.::Funding support measures should be introduced to support motivated students and farmers to develop the necessary skills to take advantage of the new opportunities offered by the bioeconomy.::8. Blue Bioeconomy::The National Policy Statement on the Bioeconomy (2018), precursor to the development and implementation of a National Bioeconomy Action Plan, extends from farming and the agri-food businesses to marine-based industries and products, recognising the potential for materials and their associated ‘waste' by-products to be converted into valuable products aimed at generating innovative products and services from these marine resources.::- Further, the EU Bioeconomy strategy mentions further integration of marine and land-based farming, which presents new approach for a sustainable blue economy::- The potential for waste and by-products should also be investigated with particular emphasis on opportunities for circular economy initiatives (reducing waste to minimum or zero). The added value of shellfish by-products and waste shell which can be re-used as biomaterial for water and wastewater treatment systems, among many other uses should also be further investigated.",

    "Subject Matter":"Common Agricultural Plan (CAP) Strategic Plan Evaluation Plan",
    "Intended Results":"To recommend that evaluation efforts are afforded to the degree to which administrative simplification has been achieved under the CSP, both from perspectives of beneficiaries and administrating authorities. Feedback to date has been that the current Common Agricultural Plan(CAP) is anything but simplified.::The proposed delay in farm payments for beneficiaries in 2023 as a result of the new system is a reflection of same and completely unacceptable, particularly in this financially challenging year, and must be resisted.::To highlight the importance of how evaluation efforts are conducted, covering not only the CSP and individual interventions therein, but also the national and EU policy instruments contributing to these goals, where aligning success or otherwise in the Common Strategic Plan (CSP) interventions toward broader economic\/social and environmental ambitions.::To recommend that evaluation of the Suckler Carbon Efficiency Plan (SCEP) within the CSP evaluation plan is not limited to its contribution to net emission reduction, when the scheme also supports other broader objectives (e.g. animal welfare; economic and social sustainability in rural Ireland etc.). These broader objectives must also be factored into the success or otherwise of the Suckler Carbon Efficiency Programme (SCEP) scheme.::To stress that maximum flexibility must be afforded within evaluations undertaken, with swift corrective action taken where necessary to support adaptation for the benefit of the farmer within the current period.::To insist that maximum advanced payments must also be afforded within individual scheme measures, to limit the financial burden encountered by farmers in terms of their implementation.::To emphasise that farmers must not be unduly disadvantaged, penalised or prone to increased on-farm inspections as a result of data collection or monitoring mechanisms\/requirements.::To insist that the privacy and data protection rights of the farmer are secure and protected at all times. The sharing or transfer of data from one data source to another, even within individual entities, is not permitted without the prior consent of the farmer.::To recommend that the level of ongoing monitoring of on-farm activities must be proportionate and similar to that afforded to other employment cohorts. Overall, the monitoring \/ inspection regime should seek to be more proactive toward achieving compliance, rather than merely tracking performance and applying penalties. Herein, the recommendations in the Agricultural Appeals Office review must be implemented without delay, and an Independent Chairman, with farmer representation appointed.::•\tMonitoring mechanisms (e.g. Fertiliser Register) need to be practical, with realistic timelines and expectations set. Undue or mandatory obligations on the part of the farmer to comply with monitoring activities in all situations will not be acceptable. Participation must be voluntary with adequate reward \/ compensation provided.::To recommend that within the context of promoting increased operating certainty and our environmental ambitions, unless to the advantage of the farmer, individual terms\/qualifications of agri-environment schemes must hold true for at least the term of the new Common Agricultural Programme (CAP). There can be no downward revision or pro-rata reduction in either payment or maximum eligible area within individual measures of future iterations of the Agri-Climate Rural Environment Scheme (ACRES).::To emphasise that, in evaluations regarding the ‘impact of changes to direct payments on farm income', it is important that a range of outcomes is provided rather than purely an average \/ aggregate perspective, as relying on aggregate data only can conceal the true impact experienced. Similarly, the degree of change must also be quantified and presented.::To highlight the importance of using Scope 1 IE data coefficients where available, rather than using international coefficients in evaluating the impact of the Common Strategic Plan (CSP) interventions on GHG and ammonia emissions using coefficients. These may not be representative of Ireland's unique grass-based production system.::In addition, it is important to recognise that the emissions reduction benefit of CSP interventions may not be immediately obvious. A time lag often exists between intervention, execution, and emission reduction benefit.::The projected impact of the Common Strategic Plan (CSP) interventions must be provided rather than purely annual year on year variation of individual interventions, with comparisons vs Baseline, EU counterparts and annual variations also beneficial.::To highlight that it is essential existing data collection mechanisms (e.g. Agri-Climate Rural Environment Scheme (ACRES) results-based scoring) are maximised before the creation of new costly mechanisms,  with regard to the proposal for ‘Monitoring and Evaluating Biodiversity (Habitats)' .::To seek clarification pertaining to R.33 ‘Improving Natura 2000 management'. A full review of the internal operating dynamic surrounding designations, compensation and applications for the Agricultural and Rural Convention (ARC) programme is required. The existing is not fit for purpose.::It is imperative that Government ensure, that maximum flexibilities apply at a local level and that actions are applied on a voluntarily basis only, but there must be an adequate financial package provided, independent of Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) funds,to compensate farmers for their endeavour and any lost income and\/or asset value arising. With regard to the latter, false promises were made in the past to farmers operating in designated areas.::This must be rectified in the first instance, and the same mistake avoided at all costs. IFA will not agree with land being designated or re-wetted without prior agreement with farmers and full compensation must be provided for any reduction in farming activity or associated impairment of land values.::To highlight the importance of wider reflections being incorporated also. For example, with the Agri-Climate Rural Environment Scheme (ACRES), only thirty thousand applicants were identified as the participating Tranche 1 target, despite general acknowledgement that a significantly higher volume of farmers would be interested in participating in the Agri-Climate Rural Environment (ACRES) scheme, having been participants of previous agri-environment schemes.::In other words, infrastructural limitations and complexity of new results-based approach, in the case of the Agri-Climate Rural Environment (ACRES) Scheme, have to date shown to be constraining factor rather than farmer demand \/ inaction.::To highlight the importance of segregating agricultural related influence from other sources, and recognise too that not all Common Strategic Plan (CSP) interventions will exhibit direct benefit to improved water quality immediately. Similarly, it is important to recognise and account for the fact that other external factors (e.g. prevailing weather conditions) can have a significant influence on water quality.::Simply layering agricultural land use data onto the Irish Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) water quality maps to determine the impact the Common Strategic Plan (CSP) interventions are having on water quality as outlined is overly simplistic and will yield erroneous results. Multi-year assessments, taking above consideration into account is required. Short-term trends are less reliable as seasonal influences and weather events can override the benefit of additional protective measures.::To question if similar profiling is planned for Best Agricultural Technique (BAT) on conventional farm operations (e.g. Low Emission Slurry Spreading (LESS); protected urea etc etc)? the same as Organic farming as per  Spending Review 2023  ‘Profiling the beneficiaries of the Organic Farming Scheme 2023-2027'.::To question how many evaluations are planned for each \/ all objectives during the relevant period according to the draft evaluation plan that states  ‘As per Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) 2022\/1475, each Member State is required to evaluate each specific objective and cross-cutting objective at least once during the programming period'.::To question if there is there a hierarchy re individual groups\/Committees and ultimate derived monitoring\/evaluation outcomes?::To question if there is a mediation \/ appeals process where consensus cannot be reached either within or across units?",

    "Subject Matter":"Plant Protection",
    "Intended Results":"That a derogation of the herbicide Diquat is secured for this season to ensure that the potato sector remains a viable enterprise for growers.::To highlight that the decommissioning of Diquat will have significant detrimental effects on the potato sector including::- Further delay of the potato season, leading to very difficult harvesting conditions and higher crop losses.::-  Potato farmer margins will be further eroded due to lower crop yields.::- The potential growth of the potato sector will be stunted::- Use of alternatives with lower efficacy will in turn cause higher food waste levels due to lower health and condition of potatoes.::- Increased crop losses may lead to further food inflation next year.::To highlight that, in relation to the successful growing and management of the potato crop, the desiccation of the potato canopy is critical, enabling growers to stop bulking when tubers reach the desired marketable size as well as promoting skin set. It also helps reduce the risk of diseases such as late blight, blackleg and virus affecting the potatoes, reducing storage problems or, in the case of seed, carrying over to future crops.::To emphasise that potato foliage needs to be destroyed about 3-4 weeks prior to harvest to ensure diseases do not pass from the foliage to the tubers in the soil below. Ireland has a wet, humid climate which results in increased disease pressure (blight, blackleg) on the potato crops compared with most European countries. Ireland also produces mainly late season variety potatoes such as Rooster (60% of the area sown)::Given the ongoing difficult weather conditions, harvesting these varieties will be delayed even further leaving the crop extremely vulnerable to both unfavourable growing conditions and higher rates of disease; subsequently producing lower yields. Therefore, in lieu of the use of Diquat, the viability of the potato sector is at significant risk.::To highlight that Diquat is the product of choice for this purpose. There are other products on the Irish market which desiccate the potato stems such as Spotlight, but they are not effective in burning the leaves. In addition, these products are only of use when the potato crop is already in senescence and must be used in combination with flailing (topping) the potato stalks in order to open the crop.::To emphasise that the topping of the potato stocks is not a viable option on all farms as it involves an extra pass of machinery, which is very difficult particularly in wet conditions due to damage to soil structure and the spreading of disease. The process can also damage potato tubers due to mechanical and bird damage, leading to severe food waste issues although we appreciate the inclusion of Haulm Toppers in the Tillage TAMS.::To insist that for other desiccants to be of any use, they must be used when light intensity is high. Light intensity levels are always much less in Ireland in the back end of the year when potato harvesting takes place. Crop development in regions such as Donegal is typically much later than the south east, which further compounds the issue for growers in this region. This will result in crops reaching maturity very late this season when daylight is shortened and light intensity low.::That there would be a derogation on Diquat for the desiccation of hybrid seed oilseed rape crops.. Ireland's cool, damp climate, combined with a very low national area of other oilseed rape\/brassica species makes it an ideal location for hybrid seed production. However, high rainfall and high humidity in August at harvest time can cause significant delays and losses prior to harvesting.::To highlight that the ability to use Diquat as a desiccant on these crops would allow quicker, more timely harvesting after rain delays and would put growers and seed assemblers in a more competitive position.::To insist that, in accordance with Article 53 of Regulation (EC) No 1107\/2009, there is provision to grant authorisation for emergency use of a plant protection product if required. Given the unprecedented volume of rainfall, emergency action for the derogation of Diquat is fundamental to the sector's viability.::To request an emergency derogation for the Plant Protection Product Diquat from the 1st of August 2023 to the 31st of October 2023 due to the absence of suitable alternatives for the potato sector and the prevailing planting and growing conditions,::To propose that the same risk mitigation measures would apply as per last year's authorisation. In this regard a part rate of the product would be required to desiccate the leaves and then follow on with one of the approved products on the stems.",

If these recommendations are implemented in the revised animal welfare legislation later this year, it could potentially result in the closure of several viable family farms and businesses. The::- The poultry sector plays a vital role in our economy, providing employment opportunities, supporting rural communities, and contributing significantly to the overall agricultural industry. Family farms and small-scale poultry businesses are the backbone of this sector, and any measures that jeopardise their existence would have far-reaching consequences for local communities across the country and indeed the EU.::To emphasise that it is crucial to consider the economic implications of the proposed changes. Birds on Irish farms are raised to Bord Bia Quality Standards, and are further audited by individual retailers to ensure that birds are kept at the highest standards.::To demonstrate the importance for the Commission to prepare an impact assessment to assess the economic, social and environmental impact of the envisaged changes to the EU animal welfare legislation. The recommendations put forward by the EFSA must be thoroughly evaluated in terms of their practicality, feasibility, and potential impact on the livelihoods of those involved in the poultry industry.::To stress the importance of recognising that chicken is the most sustainable source of meat protein. The poultry industry has made significant advancements in reducing its environmental footprint, including efficient feed conversion rates, lower greenhouse gas emissions, and responsible water usage. By promoting the consumption of poultry products, we can align our sustainability goals with the demands of the growing population.::To highlight how crucial it is to strike a delicate balance between the welfare of animals and the economic viability of our farmers and businesses. We believe that by engaging in a constructive dialogue and working collaboratively, we can find solutions that ensure the welfare of animals while safeguarding the interests of the poultry sector.",

This should have been done at the beginning of the year before the scheme opened for applications where relevant stakeholders would have been given the opportunity to contribute to its design.::To question if the late circulation for approval means that, with none yet received from the Monitoring Committee, that the Department of Agriculture, Food, and the Marine have not yet initiated their review of Tranche 1 applications. This is completely unsatisfactory if this is the case as it is creating huge issues and frustration among farmers.::To recommend that farmers are not disadvantaged in the current scheme for payments made from the Targeted Agricultural Modernisation Scheme (TAMS) 11. Marks should be assessed per applicant rather than per holding so as not to disadvantage a new entrant\/farm successor undertaking investment to better align with their future plans\/orientation of the farm business.::To challenge the logic in the Departments plan to disadvantage and penalise farmers most in need of on-farm investment. This is counter-intuitive, the objective of the scheme should be to support farmers making necessary on-farm investment.::To question the inconsistent application of the Nitrates variable - i.e. increased intensity deemed a positive for the Solar Investment Scheme; the Pig and Poultry Scheme, yet it is negative for most Targeted Agricultural Modernisation Schemes (TAMS). It is likely that the more intensive operations will be the ones most likely to be undertaking the investments.::To insist that farmers are put at the centre of negotiations given that it is Agricultural policy, farmers voices are being diluted by increasing number of non-farm stakeholders who seem to carry equal weight in these negotiations.::To highlight that the detail, depth and complexity of the documentation is overly complex which makes farmers' engagement more difficult and relies on third parties to execute. Greater simplification and recognition that it is the farm family that is being charged with administering each intervention of the Common Agricultural Policy (CAP), whether targeted at economic\/environmental or social gain.",

    "Intended Results":"To request an urgent meeting with the Minister for Agriculture, Food, and the Marine (DAFM) to relay grave concerns about the proposed new measures restricting farming activities on peatlands.::To highlight that the restrictions proposed by the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine (DAFM) to meet the Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) conditionality would designate, by the back door, up to 720,000 hectares of land and significantly erode the economic sustainability of 42,000 herd owners, and the value of assets they hold.::To highlight how the lack of engagement by the Department of Agriculture, Food, and the Marine (DAFM) with impacted farmers, and the lack of of an adequate Department of Agriculture, Food, and the Marine (DAFM) impact assessment will result in restrictions that are far too severe and are unacceptable to farmers.::To call for an alternative solution that better supports rather than disadvantages the thousands of farmers potentially affected by this and for a full socio-economic impact assessment to be completed before anything is implemented.::To propose that ;::- Department of Agriculture, Food, and the Marine (DAFM) need to cast aside current proposals and find an alternative solution that adequately rewards farmers for the protection of wetlands\/peatlands rather than economically impacting thousands of farmers via restricted measures as proposed.::- Rather than a catch-all series of restrictive measures being introduced, irrespective of underlying peat type as proposed, a robust carbon trading mechanism should be introduced first, and a proactive education initiative undertaker, providing site specific information and guidance to farmers on how best to protect peatlands, herein serving to progress both the economic and environmental sustainability of individual farms.::- It is imperative that the Department of Agriculture, Food, and the Marine (DAFM) ensures, not only that maximum flexibilities apply at local level in designing the Good Agricultural and Environment Condition (GAEC) 2 standards to minimise its impact on farm families, but also that proper engagement with farm organisations and impacted farmers is facilitated prior to its implementation.::A full socio-economic assessment of GAEC 2 restrictions required prior to any implementation of measures dwhich should be applied on a voluntary basis only.::- A January 2024 application appears unrealistic given, even now, we lack specifics on key definitions and what land is in scope. Farmers need clarity, and they need viable alternatives too. A later application date therefore is required.::- There must be an adequate financial package provided, paid annually and independent of Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) funds, to compensate farmers for their endeavour, any reduction in farming activity, and any lost income and\/or asset value arising from Good Agricultural and environment Condition (GAEC) standard 2.::- It is important that Good Agricultural and Environmental Condition (GAEC) 2 measures relate only to the protection of peatlands\/wetlands, and should apply only, on individual land parcels, where > 50% of the land parcel is covered by organic soil of at least 30% (dry mass) organic matter over a depth of at least 45cm in undrained land and 30cm deep on drained land.::- It is imperative that ongoing maintenance activities (e.g. existing drainage networks; active pumping etc) including the installation of replacement and additional drains where relevant, are permitted to preserve current land use and drainage systems, and that any introduced measures does not economically disadvantage the farm operation.::- The implementation of the Good Agricultural and Environmental Condition (GAEC) 2 in it's design, must acknowledge and take account of other National\/EU policies and indeed other GAEC's within the Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) programme seeking to protect peatland\/wetlands.::- A full review of the internal operating dynamic surrounding designations, compensation and applications for Activities Requiring Consent (ARC) is required because the existing is not fit for puropse.",

    "DPOs Lobbied":"Charlie McConalogue|Minister|Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine",
    "Subject Matter":"Carbon Farming Framework for Ireland",
    "Intended Results":"To emphasise that farmers are committed to playing their part in reducing greenhouse gas emissions. Already, they have made significant investments to improve efficiency and reduce emissions. In dealing with the climate change challenge, it is imperative that Irish farmers' current sustainability credentials and the existing carbon reservoirs on farms in the soils and hedgerows are fully acknowledged.::To seek additional payment to carry out the measures set out in the Climate Action Plan 2023 (CAP23) to deliver the emissions reduction target. Even if a measure is supported under the Climate Action Plan (CAP) or the Forest Programme farmers should be eligible to generate an additional payment for the carbon removed or the emissions reduced as a result of the measure being implemented.::To insist that this payment will be paramount to incentivise widespread adoption and the long-term sustained change that is required at farm level to meet sectoral targets. Based on the latest Teagasc MACC report widespread and near full adoption of measures set out in the Climate Action Plan (CAP) 23 is required to deliver the legally binding emission reduction targets.::To highlight that a  primary motivation for farmers to adopt carbon farming practices, particularly at the scale required, will be that it improves overall economic profitability and intergenerational resilience of their farm business. These co-benefits will be strong motivators for adoption and should be central to the design of Ireland's carbon farming framework.::Carbon Farming Definition -::To welcome the widening of the scope of the definition of carbon farming as proposed in the guidance document to go beyond carbon removals. Under the proposed framework there will be a three-pronged approach to reward measures undertaken by farmers to (i) remove carbon, (ii) reduce\/avoid emissions and (iii) deliver co-benefits of biodiversity and ecosystems.::- The expansion of definition to include emissions reduction and nature-based solutions is very important considering that carbon removals such as afforestation or rewetting peatlands are accounted for under Land Use and Land Use Change and Forestry (LULUCF) not under Agriculture.::- Bearing in mind that approximately 65% of agriculture's emissions are biogenic methane it was vital that the framework created a mechanism that can value and pay farmers for reducing on farm emissions and support the widespread adoption of the proposed measures set out in the Climate Action Plan 2023.::Credibility of Carbon Framework -::To propose that Ireland should take advantage of the lessons learnt from voluntary carbon markets (VCMs), particularly around allegations of “greenwashing” that some programmes have been plagued with in recent years as they did not deliver the predicted carbon reductions.::To ensure that the development of government led regulatory framework to certify carbon removals or emission reductions is based on robust measurement, using Irish science where possible, to safeguard the credibility and integrity of the carbon credits generated on Irish farms. There must be full transparency on the guidelines, methodologies used as well as carbon transactions to create trust.::If there is trust in the framework this could lead to greater market activity and potentially unleash significant finance to enable farmers to invest in low-carbon technologies and nature-based climate solutions.::Additionality Viewed Negatively by Farmers -::To demonstrate that the proposed additionality requirement that farmers would only be eligible for a carbon payment for new actions or measures implemented to remove carbon is viewed negatively by farmers, as it (i) does not value the existing carbon reservoir in soils and or hedgerows on farms and (ii) penalises earlier adopters of practices that have improved carbon removals and prevents them from earning as much money as farmers who adopt practices later.::To propose that the additionality requirement as well as the definition of additionality be reviewed so that it does not create an unfair penalty for farmers who had been innovative and forward-thinking enough to adopt beneficial practices years before the framework is introduced. Farmers should be paid for their beneficial practices, regardless of when they started.::To highlight how studies have shown that the additionality requirement can establish a perverse incentive against maintaining beneficial practices over the long term and\/or encourage farmers to switch practices in order to qualify or enhance their eligibility for payments in the future. This needs to be fully considered as part of the development of the framework.::Terms and Conditions of Carbon Payment -::To ensure that the carbon farming framework provides farmers with an additional payment for the carbon removed or the emissions reduced to encourage farmers to act for the climate. A farmer must not be restricted from receiving a carbon payment if in receipt of a Climate Action Plan (CAP) payment for undertaking a measure that is included within the framework.::To highlight that, as set out in Ireland's Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) Strategic Plan 2023-2027, payments are made based on (i) additional costs incurred and (ii) income foregone as set out in the EU Regulations under Article 31 (7) (b) of the Common Agricultural Plan (CAP) Strategic Plan Regulation. It is not a payment for the carbon sequestered or the ecosystem service provided.::Therefore, farmers should be eligible for a carbon payment even if the measure is supported under the Climate Action Plan (CAP), particularly considering the carbon sequestered goes beyond the lifespan of the current Climate Action Plan (CAP) programme.::Predictable Carbon Payments -::That the carbon price to be paid must be predictable and fully transparent for each measure eligible under the framework. The uncertainty with regards payments has been a criticism of farmers who have participated in VCMs globally.::To highlight that, according to studies the most consistent complaint raised by farmers participating in carbon markets is that the payment is simply too low to drive substantial practice changes on their farms. The cost of changing practices, should be fully compensated, or else farmers will be hesitant to take a ‘leap of faith' into the VCM.::To propose that a clear price signal would allow farmers to plan and invest in low-carbon technologies and nature-based climate solutions. Establishing a carbon price corridor (carbon floor and ceiling price) that could be reviewed regularly could provide the necessary certainty and reduce the risk for farmers as there would be transparency on the payment to be received.::To ensure that, as carbon sequestration is a long-term process, farmers need long-term support for at least 20 years.::Farmers Must be Main Beneficiary -::To insist that the carbon farming framework must be designed and structured to benefit farmers rather than agri-businesses, large corporations and\/or offset buyers. There must be transparency in relation to the pricing structures and traceability to ensure that farmers are being fairly paid to undertake the measures versus the carbon price paid for the credit generated.::- The framework must support the development of a fair price for farmers that reflects the real costs for farmers, as well as for the benefits for society. It is important to prevent the reward for carbon farming from entering an international race to the bottom, just as we do with food prices.::Suitable for All Farm Types -::To propose that the carbon farming framework must be structured so that it can be easily applied to all farm types and enterprises. The cost of measuring and verifying carbon credits, including third party verification, must not be a barrier to smaller family farms participating. The level of detail required to participate in the programme must not disadvantage small and mid-sized farms and contribute to further consolidation of agricultural land.::Standardisation of Measure, Verify and Report (MVR) of Different Measures -::To insist that Teagasc should be the lead organisation to support the development of science-based methodologies to measure, verify and report (MRV) the carbon reductions. This would complement the work that is ongoing as part of the development of the MACC, Signpost Farms and the NationalAgricultural Soil Carbon Observatory (NASCO). It would also ensure that the credits are only issued for genuine reductions in greenhouse gases.::Support Widespread Adoption -::To highlight that, in order to support widespread adoption farmers must trust the systems and methods used to measure the carbon payment. The incentive for adoption must reflect the effort and cost of implementing the measure as well the costs involved in measuring, verifying and reporting, which could hinder the wider adoption of the framework by farmers.::Simple and Streamlined Participation Process -::To ensure that the framework should not be excessively convoluted and burdensome, and should enable farmers once baseline has been created to input data without the need of professional assistance. It should have simple methodologies and flexibility including easy to follow rules and administrative processes and it should not impose legal constraints that may affect the viability of the farm and the earning potential of future farmers.::Governance -::To propose that formal adoption of voluntary frameworks into national rules would help delineate responsibilities and reduce the opportunities for inaccuracies and fraud. The framework should aim to connect companies looking to offset their carbon footprint directly with farmers. This would give buyers the comfort of knowing that their money actually ends up with the farmers they want to support.::It should provide a clear and motivating framework that is aligned with other policy objectives and requirements (CAP23, Water Framework Directive (WFD), National Biodiversity Action Plan, proposed EU Nature Restoration law, proposed EU Soil Monitoring law etc.). This would avoid contradictory policy and administrative tangle for farmers at farm level.::Farmers must not Lose Control of their Data -::To highlight that, to qualify for carbon credits, farmers will be required to share enormous amounts of data about what is happening on their farm. Farmers are concerned about who will control the data and as this could provide agri-businesses and companies with unprecedented access to their data. Often these are the same companies on which farmers depend for purchasing farm inputs, hence creating a conflict-of-interest situation. All data must remain in the ownership of participating farmers.::Educational and Training Barriers -::To insist that it will be vital that information and training is provided to interested farmers. Educational barriers, such as insufficient knowledge or training, have been widely cited as a barrier to adoption. These barriers include unfamiliarity with and lack of information about practices, their requirements under the framework and concerns about the costs of implementing new activities, despite financial incentives.::This will help to support adoption and will alleviate concerns and\/or potential distrust of Voluntary Carbon Markets (VCMs).::To acknowledge that the Voluntary Carbon Markets (VCM) have the potential to offer farmers new opportunities to diversify and generate additional income to improve the long-term resilience of their farm. However, for such incentives to be effective in inducing farmers to implement on-farm activities, they need to be functional for farmers who are implementing them.::To highlight that there are a number of barriers that need to be considered as part of the development of Ireland carbon farming framework which include;::(i) farmers unfamiliarity with and lack of information about practices::(ii) concerns about the costs of implementing new activities versus the carbon payment as well as the predictability of that payment::(iii) the additionality requirement to qualify for payment::(iv) additional paperwork and administrative requirements::v) a lack of predictability and the 'black box' of credit calculations.::To emphasise that it is imperative that changes are made to ensure farmers who are already sequestering carbon both above and below ground are rewarded for these actions. A system that only pays based on additionality will not be credible in the eyes of farmers and fails to reward the sequestration already taking place n many farms via hedgerows and regenerative practices that promote increased coil carbon storage.",

    "Subject Matter":"Data Sharing Agreement between Bord Bia and the Department of Agriculture, Food, and the Marine",
    "Intended Results":"To respond to the draft Data Sharing Agreement between Bord Bia and the Department of Agriculture, Food, and the Marine for the purpose of identifying herds\/flocks participating in the Bord Bia and Quality Assurance Scheme where a legal notice has been issued under Section 42 of the Animal Health and Welfare Act 2013 and communicating the details of the notice to inform the audit program.::To highlight that IFA is of the view that there should be no requirement to establish a formal data sharing agreement in this case as the primary objective must be the welfare of the animals, which is already dealt with in the aforementioned legislation.::To insist that the Department of Agriculture, Food, and the Marine (DAFM) are the competent authority to enforce this legislation and ensure adherence with this Act, which does not allow for or require the sharing of any data with a Quality Assurance Certification body.::To highlight that the  welfare of the farmer is not mentioned within this Digital Services Act (DSA) but is of utmost importance too. It is important to note that in some cases, the trigger behind the issuing of a legal notice under section 42 can be associated with or on the back of a human welfare issue. The issuing of legal notices under section 42 of the Animal Welfare Act are thankfully rare occurrences and ordinarily there is something more complex behind the situation.::To ensure that the objective must be to resolve the issue on the farm while being cognisant of the strong correlation between these cases and the sometimes-difficult individual personal circumstances which may arise. There must also be a recognition for the potential difficulties for the farmer being associated with these situations and the additional stress and pressure that a spot audit can bring upon a farmer in an already difficult situation.::To emphasise that IFA is not in agreement with the sharing of a farmer's data with Bord Bia to determine whether the farm is Bord Bia Quality Assured or not. This would be notifying Bord Bia of the issuing of a legal notice on a farmer who may not have a farm that is Bord Bia Quality Assured.::To demonstrate that in table 9.2 it is stated “To ensure accuracy of information, it was determined that a minimum of three data fields (farmer and, address and herd\/flock number) are necessary.” This is data sharing, and, in this case, it is the sharing of very sensitive data with Bord Bia. If the farmer is determined to be a member of a Bord Bia Scheme and an audit is to be conducted, there is every chance that the farmer may know the auditor either directly or indirectly.::These audits are carried out by personnel contracted by Bord Bia via an outside agency. Potentially, the auditor may be a local farmer doing audits on a part time contract basis. This data sharing could be effectively with neighbours of the farmers concerned who do not work directly for Bord Bia.::Given the extremely low number of additional spot audits that occur in the Bord Bia scheme and even if Bord Bia were to provide assurances that auditors would not receive the reason for the spot audit, it is unreasonable to believe that auditors will not identify the reason for it and therefore will be effectively provided albeit indirectly, by Bord Bia with extremely sensitive and personnel data that they have no right to or purpose in receiving.::To highlight the extremely low numbers of situations where these notices are issued while retaining accreditation under the QA Scheme, and the particularly complex nature of the issues that usually contribute to them provide the opportunity for a more practical and effective means of addressing the potential contradiction in terms of a herd\/flock having such a notice issued while retaining the QA scheme accreditation.::To recognise that there is a long-established structure in place under the Farmer and Animal Welfare Network (FAWN) where, in every county there is a network of farmers, DAFM personnel and Animal Welfare organisations that work collectively to resolve these types of situations\/cases in the majority of situations before they elevate to the serving of such a notice.::To highlight that the approach outlined recognises the complexities and sensitivities in these situations, is fully supported by the Department of Agriculture, Food, and the Marine (DAFM) and regularly referenced by the Minister for Agriculture in recognition of its success.::To emphasise that IFA does not believe the establishment of a formal data sharing agreement is the appropriate approach in these circumstances. The proposal to put in place a formal data sharing agreement with a third party is very much at odds with the long established and successful approach adopted by the Department of Agriculture, Food, and the Marine (DAFM) to-date.::To request the opportunity to meet and discuss this issue to identify a more practical and sensitive approach to addressing the concerns relating to the existence of a potential contradiction in terms of how the herd\/flock is categorised\/viewed.",

    "Intended Results":"To object to the  proposed amendments to the Targeted Agricultural Modernisation Scheme (TAMS) Solar Capital Investment Scheme, not to allow skylights be replaced with cladding to facilitate solar installations. This is a complete U-turn and contrary to guidance provided by the Department at an earlier engagement in February, from which many solar systems have been designed in good faith, and applications made to the above scheme since.::To point out that the proposed changes, seeking additional paperwork, clarifications and ultimately system re-designs may appear insignificant, but it is hugely problematic in terms of solar installations. It will not only add cost to farmers and challenge planners to get amended applications in on time, but fundamentally, if implemented, it will impact the viability and uptake of individual solar project investments, both in current and future tranches of TAMS.::To highlight that it is completely unfair that farmers are given just 10 days to reply, or fear being removed from the scheme, in particular when you consider some may have only received their letter this week, Christmas week, when planners may be unavailable to make the necessary amends to applications\/design. Maximum flexibility and practicality needs to apply here.::To demonstrate that the shift in position, coupled with its timing, is further example of the absence of proactive engagement by the Department with relevant stakeholders, and indeed full appreciation of the impact of this unilateral action on the many farm families affected.::To strongly urge the Minister for Agriculture, Food, and the Marine to intervene and prevent these impractical and unviable proposals from taking effect.",

Within proposed allocations, a significant proportion, through pilot projects or elsewhere, is monies that would have been received directly by Irish farmers. All re-directed funds should follow similarly.::To question what happens to the previously budgeted Organics funding from the Rural Development Programme (RDP)\/Common Agricultural Strategic Plan (CSP) where the scheme is now, as proposed, going to be funded from Rural Development Programme (RDP) funding for 2023.

    "Intended Results":"To put forward particular measures that would help address issues faced by farmers in Ireland with the Common Agricultural Policy (CAP).::To highlight  significant impacts on farmers through legislation that falls outside the remit of DG Agriculture(EU).::To highlight that Irish farmers are among the most exposed in the EU to Good Agricultural and Environmental Condition (GAEC) 2 requirements given approximately 18% of Ireland is defined as peatland, one of the highest shares in the EU.::That initial estimates by the Irish Department of Agriculture suggest, using Teagasc-Environment Protection Agency (EPA) Soils and Subsoils mapping, that almost one-in three Irish farmers could be impacted (c. 42,000 of c. 130,000 farmers) by Good Agricultural and Environmental Condition (GAEC) 2 restrictions, with higher concentrations in the Midlands and along the rural Western seaboard of Ireland.::To propose that any implementation of Good Agricultural and Environmental Condition (GAEC) 2 should be postponed with a further derogation provided to Member States to allow additional analysis. This derogation should be available annually to Member States to the end of the current Common Agricultural Programme (CAP).::To propose that, before any Good Agricultural and Environmental Condition (GAEC) 2 standard is applied in Ireland, a full comprehensive analysis must be conducted on the socio-economic impact of the measures on farmers. Until this is established, the requirements under conditionality must be delayed in their entirety.::GAEC 7::To highlight that Irish arable farmers have emerged from a very difficult season in 2023. Economic analysis from Teagasc, the Irish National Agriculture and Food Development Authority, has highlighted a 60% drop in incomes on these farms relative to 2022.::To make aware that weather conditions in the autumn of 2023 across Europe were extremely challenging and Ireland was no exception to this. Only 62% of winter cereal crops were established in Ireland during this period. This  situation has been compounded by a shortfall in the availability of spring seeds. ::Planting of winter cereal varieties was planned up until mid-February as a solution to alleviate the shortage of spring seeds, however, this has not been possible due to unsettled weather conditions.::To propose that a continuation of the derogation from Good Agricultural and Environmental Condition (GAEC) 7 requirements of the three-crop rule and crop diversification for the 2024 harvest as justified by the criteria laid out above. The option of force majeure through the simplification measures must be confirmed immediately for farmers for the 2024 growing season due to increasing concern about meeting the requirements of Good Agricultural and Environmental Condition (GAEC )7.::Nitrates Directive\/Derogation::To demonstrate that the constant review of the Nitrates Action Programme (NAP) every 2 years provides no certainty to farmers. Farmers are now reluctant to invest in measures to protect water quality as they are uncertain if they will be able to meet the financial commitment should further erosion of the derogation occur.::To highlight that the nitrates derogation is a key component of the pasture based dairy and livestock production systems adopted in Ireland. This derogation does not give the Irish agricultural sector a competitive advantage, it merely levels the playing field as all other costs of production (especially feed and fertiliser) are higher in Ireland relative to other member states.::Losing the derogation would be an unmitigable blow to the viability of small to medium sized family farms and yet there is no guarantee that its removal would result in any improvement in water quality. Based on our understanding of the complexity of factors that impact water quality, we advocate for targeted and tailored measures to mitigate potential nutrient loss from farms to our catchments rather than blunt blanket instruments.::To propose that the review of the Nitrates Directive and the granting of derogations under the directive must recognise and respect the position of member states who rely on the Nitrates Derogation to maintain grass based sustainable farming systems.::The facility of a nitrates derogation, granted for a longer period, must be sustained in order to affirm the viability of sustainable grass-based production systems which offer multiple environmental and animal welfare benefits.  Any reduction in the derogation will in fact be counter productive in terms of achieving various environmental and sustainability objectives.",

    "Subject Matter":"Draft National Biomethane Strategy",
    "Intended Results":"To proposes that financial considerations must be one of the stated missions of this strategy. It is positive to note the mention of this strategy being “agri-led and farmer-centric” and it aligning with circular bio economy development and enablement of sectorial emissions targets to be met. To develop the scale of a Biomethane\/AD industry (5.77TWh by 2030) as is laid out in the strategy document then financial certainty for all those along its value chain must be at its core.::To highlight that the ability of small scale financially independent investors to gain funding to partake in such an undertaking will be significantly hampered without a guarantee of an offtake price, as an example here in Ireland, look at how the wind sector has developed. In other European countries where AD has been successfully developed, operational supports are a cornerstone of their industries, a point noted on page 14 of the document.::Framework for developing the national biomethane strategy::To note that economics is listed as one of the key pillars of this strategy. Unfortunately, without any concrete details and the expectation that end users will pick up the full extra cost of biomethane it is hard to see how this strategy document will enable Ireland to meet its biomethane target for 2030.::Although sustainability, demand, bioeconomy & circular economy, and enabling policy are undeniably crucial aspects, their efficacy ultimately hinges on the economic viability established within the 'economics of biomethane' framework. Without a clear delineation of economic modelling and a robust plan for funding and financing of the sector, the efficacy of the other pillars may be compromised.::Therefore, it's imperative for the strategy to prioritise laying out a comprehensive economic strategy and financing plan to underpin the successful implementation of the broader objectives.::Enabling Policy Requirements is also mentioned here as a key pillar again details on this pillar are very sparce. Lag times on current construction projects in Ireland due to planning and regulation delays would indicate that the same is likely to happen in the development of AD plants.::The document highlights the various agencies relevant to enabling the delivery of the targets (An Bord Pleanala, DAFM, SEAI, and the EPA). Reference is made on Page 32 to the Department of Agriculture, Food, and the Marine (DAFM) and Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage (DHLGH) 2 “developing a standardised code of practice for local authorities to be followed when assessing an AD and biorefining planning application” – but no time frame has been set.::The major problem is the time that it takes to get all the Agency approvals has been measured in years rather than months. This is a serious concern as we are less than six years from 2030.::If the Government is serious about reaching the target for biomethane by 2030 then a whole of Government approach on this will be required and we recommend a single department would take full responsibility for all planning and regulation issues. Clear national guidelines should be published quickly on what is required for an AD plant to gain approval for construction.::All ambiguity that may slow such projects needs to be eliminated. It should be clearly understood by both developers of an AD plant and those in local authorities who decide on these issues exactly what is required for a successful planning application.::Biomethane helps Reduce Agriculture Sector Emissions::The potential to reduce agricultural emissions through investing in “appropriate infrastructure” is mentioned in this section but again no details on any incentives or possible funding mechanisms are mentioned.::If, as the document states, this is to be “agri-led and farmer-centric” then substantial capital grants will be required for farmers who wish to develop AD on their farms. As mentioned above operational supports will also be required to enable full farmer involvement. Without these there is a fear this will become an investor\/developer led AD sector, with farmers only seen as suppliers of feedstock and taking away digestate.::If this is the road of travel, then the chances of reaching 5.9TWh by 2030 will be close to non existent.::Collaboration similar to the cooperative model is also mentioned, IFA believe this is something that should be further investigated and encouraged for the benefit of farmers.::Sustainable Digestate Management::The “Sustainable Digestate Management” section (beginning on Page 26) talks about digestate being viewed as a waste product and a burden for AD plants. It then proceeds to talk about “transforming digestate into a valuable bio based fertiliser which can generate a potential revenue stream for plant operators. How is the digestate “transformed”? What process is required?::How is the digestate and the “transformed product” classified and regulated (or to be regulated) under the Good Agricultural Practice for the Protection of Water Regulations in Ireland? It makes sense for the “biobased fertilisers” to be treated similarly to chemical fertiliser.::This draft strategy document acknowledges the potential for the agricultural sector to transition towards utilising bio based fertilizers such as digestate as an alternative to chemical fertilisers. In Ireland, where grassland dominates with a smaller portion allocated to tillage and crop lands, this shift presents a significant opportunity. However, the discussion on the replacement of chemical fertilisers with digestate in the document appears somewhat simplistic.::One critical aspect overlooked in the draft is the regulatory hurdles associated with implementing this transition, particularly in the context of the nitrates directive. Currently, digestate is categorised as organic fertiliser, while chemical fertilisers are considered inorganic. Despite the nutrient transformation that occurs during the anaerobic digestion process, making them more readily available to plants, the regulatory classification still distinguishes them as separate entities.::A change in this categorisation, so that biobased fertilisers are treated similarly to chemical fertilisers is supported by research completed by the EU Commission Joint Research Centre (JRC) in 20202. Further, the Dutch, Danish and Italian delegations to the EU Council of Agriculture and Fisheries meeting on 23 January 2024 presented a paper wishing to see this change also.::It's imperative for the strategy to acknowledge and address these regulatory disparities. There needs to be a concerted effort to recognise the nuanced differences between chemical fertilisers and digestate from a regulatory standpoint. This includes outlining the necessary steps to amend existing regulations to accommodate and facilitate the widespread adoption of digestate as a viable alternative to chemical fertilisers.::By addressing these regulatory challenges upfront, the strategy can pave the way for a smoother transition of agricultural practices.::Wording::To highlight that there is a reference to “animal wastes” – what is this a reference to? If this refers to animal manures or other by-products – should it refer to “animal by-products” rather than “wastes”? The use of the “waste” term is unhelpful as it conveys a cost rather than a value. It also is important in relation to what may be regulated under the Waste Management Regulations.::The word “waste” should not be used if it is referring to products that are already regulated under other regulations (such as animal by-products regulations and the Good Agricultural Practice for Protection of Waters Regulations (currently SI 113 of 2022)). More, animal slurries and manures are not “wastes” per the Brady v EPA case,4 rather they are “bye-products”. They do not come under the EU waste directive.::To question the statement;“…from transportation of waste feedstocks right through to delivery of gas to customers.” Is this saying all feedstocks are waste? If so, consider amending as per above.::Also, reference is made to “residual materials and other by-products, which would usually be waste products…. for instance slurry”. This needs to be corrected to reflect the regulations as set out above.::There is mention of “liquor”, what exactly is meant in this instance? Also it specifies that this should not be spread before 15th of March, is there research to back up this date or how was it arrived at?::There may be other inappropriate references to Animal manures\/by-products as wastes in the document – and these should also be amended.::IFA requirements for a successful farm led AD\/Biomethane industry::A set of requirements that IFA see's as fundamental if widespread support of an AD industry is to happen in Ireland. For a strategy to outline a roadmap that has a realistic chance of meeting the 2030 target for Biomethane IFA believes each of these requirements must be met. These are as follows::- Develop an effective National Biomethane Strategy that allows full farm participation in AD and the confidence to invest in AD.::- Full reflection of the emissions savings realised from the production of biomethane from agriculture feedstock must be allocated to agriculture in the national inventory.::- Introduce a Renewable Heat Obligation scheme (RHO) with sustainable subsidies as soon as possible to support the wide scale development of an AD sector. This will give greater certainty and security of revenue for farmer led projects.::- Provide capital grant funding to support the construction of viable on farm AD plants and for on farm storage of digestate from AD plants. This funding must come from the Department of Energy and Climate Change budget.::- Government backed finance (similar to current SBCI lending structures) to be provided to enable farmers develop AD plants.::- Introduce a biomass mobilisation scheme to support farmers to coordinate, mobilise and establish a sustainable feedstock supply chain for AD plants.::- Streamline current regulations to support the development of AD plants, in particular farm scale AD plants, with statutory timelines imposed on regulatory and licensing authorities. National guidelines are required so all local authorities can assess possible AD projects under the same criteria.::- Ensure the maximum amount of farm slurries and farmyard manures are used in AD plants in Ireland.::- Minimise the displacement of human food production for the supply of feedstocks for AD plants in order to safeguard Food Security.::- No agricultural feedstocks supplied to AD plants to be classified as waste.::- Where any non agricultural materials are used in AD plants, strict rules must be complied with, to ensure no contaminants are spread on farm land or enter the food supply.::- Establish a fair, equitable and independent pricing mechanism to ensure a sustainable feedstock price for farmers who wish to supply AD plants.::- All taxations rules, reliefs and exemptions that currently apply to agriculture must continue for farmers involved in AD.::- To support more circular based agricultural practices, it must be ensured that digestate from AD plants is reclassified under the Nitrates Directive and as outlined in the 2020 JRC report5 to ensure it does not count towards a farms organic Nitrogen load.::- Digestate from AD plants to be eligible for spreading on Organic farmland.::- At all times grass and other animal feed products must be prioritised for animals. If at any time there is potential of animal welfare issues from a shortage of fodder in the country then produce that can be fed to animals must be diverted from AD plants for use as feed for animals.::- Ensure a streamlined system is in place for the importation of animal manures and slurries and the exportation of digestate from AD plants. If built on farm these imports and exports must be treated separately when assessing those farms organic load from its farming enterprise.::- Review of Animal By Product Regulation on requirements re pasteurisation. Where only agricultural feedstocks are supplied to an AD facility there should be no requirement for pasteurisation.::To emphasise that IFA is fully supportive of an “agri-led, farmer centric” AD industry in Ireland to help reach the target of 5.7TWh of biomethane production by 2030. There are many areas in this strategy document that we agree with, but we have grave concerns on the lack of any financial\/economic details within it.::To highlight that in order to secure farmer involvement, certainty of income streams will be required when seeking finance. Without this, obtaining finance will be near impossible. This will mean AD development will be exclusively by large institutional investors and the farmer will be but a supplier of feedstock.::This may suit some farmers, but many want to be fully involved in this industry. To deny them that opportunity will mean we will have an industry that will never reach its full potential.::To highlight that Capital Grants will be required to enable farmer involvement in the construction and ownership of AD plants, but if, as it currently looks likely the strategy\/hope is that Ireland will meet the 2030 biomethane target without any operational supports, then in IFA's view, there will be no possibility of meeting the 2030 target.::In addition to the construction of the actual AD plants, construction of storage facilities for digestate will also be required. Where, this storage is constructed on farms, for reasons such as ease of access at suitable times for spreading of the digestate, then capital grants will be required for construction of this storage.::These grants should not come from the DAFM budget or through existing TAMS fundings. This, along with all capital grants in relation to development of AD must instead come from the Department of Energy and Climate Change.::When designing the feedstock mix for any future AD industry, cognisance must be taken of Ireland's tillage sector and the opportunity it will provide as both a feedstock supplier and receiver of digestate from AD plants. The increase in the amount of cover crops planted in Ireland in recent years means the availability of material from this source should be considered as a viable and sustainable feedstock::Irish Tillage Sector and Anaerobic Digestion::In contrast with much of continental Europe Ireland does not have any significant area of arable land devoted to production of energy crops for anaerobic digestion (AD). Primary crops such as maize, whole-crop cereal, energy beet and grass silages all offer significant potential as feedstocks for anaerobic digestion in Ireland. The introduction of these crops and also perennial grasses and legumes could bring agronomic benefits to crop rotations on tillage farms.::development of a wider AD network would provide tillage farmers with an alternative market to combinable crops. The area of tillage in 2024 and beyond is under significant threat due to changes in agricultural polices such as CAP and the Irelands Nitrates Action Plan. High yielding crops such as energy beet and maize for anaerobic digestion could enable tillage farmers to remain more economically competitive in future years.::Energy Cover Crops::The integration of secondary energy cover crops within crop rotations has increased significantly in Europe in recent years. This has been primarily to address questions which have been raised around the sustainability of maize production exclusively for biogas production.::Energy cover crops are grown intermediately between two crops and therefore do not directly compete with crops produced for human consumption or animal feed. This is an important consideration in Ireland given our low self - sufficiency in grain production for animal and human consumption at the present time.::Cover crops deliver a multitude environmental benefits for soil health. Approximately 40,000ha of cover crops are now planted in the Republic of Ireland each year, with relatively small changes in management, this land area could provide a sizeable quantity for biomass generation without compromising on production of crops for food\/feed.::This would also generate a secondary income stream for tillage farms when land might otherwise be bare or idle. Intermediate crops are also compliant with proposed future RED II Legislation by the European Union.::To date, energy cover crops have been largely categorised into two categories7 (i) summer energy cover crops and (ii) winter energy cover crops. In Ireland summer energy crops such could very conceivably be grown after early harvested primary cereal crops such as winter barley and particularly in southern and eastern counties where harvest now frequently commences in the last week of June and early July period.::This biomass could be harvested in the early or late autumn months depending on growth rates . Winter energy cover crops could be planted in early August after cereals such as spring barley and remain in the ground over winter and the biomass harvested in early spring ahead of a spring crop being planted.::Other considerations::Digestate by-product is a valuable and nutrient rich organic fertiliser. Tillage land in close proximity to future AD developments is therefore an ideal destination for the application of digestate. The return of an adequate supply of digestate will be a determining factor in the amount of biomass that can be produced through primary and secondary crops.::Teagasc analysis in 2023 states that 57% of soil samples from tillage land were Index 1 and 2 for phosphate and potash and therefore will benefit from organic manure application to try and bring soil fertility to the desired optimal of index 3. Digestate is an excellent source of nutrients for the tillage sector and has been shown to have a higher percentage of available nutrients compared with other organic manures.::Increased utilisation of manures to cropland is also one of three targeted mitigation measures identified in the Teagasc MACC curve and a more widely available supply of digestate would be a significantly increase the likelihood of this target being achieved. This would also reduce the quantity of synthetic fertilisers required on tillage farms.",

    "Subject Matter":"Potato Herbicide",
    "Intended Results":"To emphasise that crucial adaptive measures must be taken to secure the viability of the Irish potato sector. Such measures include a derogation for use of the contact herbicide Diquat.::To highlight that the planting season has been prolonged significantly due to the extensive rainfall during the critical groundwork period of March and April, which means that the potato harvesting season will be inevitably delayed. The incessant wet weather has resulted in an extremely late year. IFA estimate that only 50% of plantings are complete. It is inevitable that it will again be a late year and the possibility of similar challenges to last year being experienced during harvest.::To highlight that light intensities will be remarkably lower than normal conditions when these crops need to be desiccated next September. Alternatives to Diquat include Spotlight, a post-emergence herbicide used to desiccate potato haulms. However, this desiccant is deemed ineffective in comparison to Diquat, particularly given the late season farmers face as a result of the inordinately difficult spring sowing conditions.::To highlight that the decommissioning of Diquat will have significant detrimental effects on the potato sector including::•\tFurther delay of the potato season, leading to very difficult harvesting conditions and higher crop losses.::•\tPotato farmer margins will be eroded due to lower crop yields.::•\tThe potential growth of the potato sector will be stunted::•\tUse of alternatives with lower efficacy will in turn cause higher food waste levels due to lower health and condition of potatoes.::•\tIncreased crop losses may lead to potato scarcity and to further food inflation next year.::To emphasise that in accordance with Article 53 of Regulation (EC) No 1107\/2009, there is provision to grant authorisation for emergency use of a plant protection product if required. Given the unprecedented volume of rainfall and the absence of suitable alternatives for the potato sector and the prevailing planting and growing conditions, IFA is requesting an emergency derogation for the Plant Protection Product Diquat from the 1st of August 2024 to the 31st of October 2024.::To propose that, under a potential emergency authorisation for use of Diquat in Ireland, the same risk mitigation measures would apply as per last year's authorisation. In this regard a part rate of the product would be required to desiccate the leaves and then follow on with one of the approved products on the stems. I want to reiterate how important this issue is to the sector and how serious the failure to grant derogation will be to the future viability of the Irish potato industry.::To urgently seek a meeting with the Minister for Agriculture, Food, and the Marine to discuss a derogation for this year.",

The land is simply too wet in many parts.::To point out that IFA is getting reports from suppliers, particularly in the West of the country, that although increasing, only 20-30% of prepaid lime has actually been delivered and spread to date. This is concerning.::To highlight that many farmers, particularly those with red clover swards, will be looking to get multiple silage crops this year to rebuild fodder reserves given the long and extended housing period last year.::Fearing forced repayment of monies received, particularly in the high-cost year that has been, there exists a danger that some may apply lime onto silage ground between harvest to comply with scheme requirements.

    "Subject Matter":"Salmonella Compensation",
    "Intended Results":"To highlight the critical issue of compensation for salmonella outbreaks in poultry flocks. Recent incidents have highlighted significant gaps in the current compensation framework, which are placing our farmers under severe financial strain and threatening the long-term viability of the poultry sector.::To highlight that under Section 31(1) of the Animal Health and Welfare Act 2013, financial assistance or compensation for outbreaks is provided on an ex-gratia basis, co-funded by both the State and the EU. Eligible costs for compensation include the market value of the flock on the date of slaughter, the value of destroyed eggs, and transportation costs incurred. However, the current compensation amounts are often insufficient to cover the actual losses incurred by farmers.::To point out that the estimated value of affected birds alone can significantly exceed the compensation offered as observed in a recent case, not to mention additional costs incurred for culling and other necessary measures. This is without taking into account any consequential losses which are incurred.::To stress that there is also a pressing need for the establishment of a domestic culling team to reduce reliance on external teams, which can add substantial costs and delays during outbreaks.::To highlight that the poultry sector, producing an annual output of around €700 million at wholesale prices and supporting over 5,000 jobs (with over 3,500 based in the border region), is of significant economic importance. Therefore, it is crucial that the Department of Agriculture, Food, and the Marine allocates a more substantial budget to address the financial repercussions of salmonella outbreaks for both breeder flocks and table egg layers.::To urge the Department of Agriculture to;::• Reassess the current compensation framework  Ensure it accurately reflects the true market value of the birds and other incurred costs to prevent placing undue financial burdens on farmers.::• Increase transparency  Provide clear, detailed breakdowns of compensation calculations to ensure fairness and understanding among affected farmers.::• Establish a domestic culling team  Secure funding for a dedicated culling team within Ireland to facilitate timely and cost-effective responses to outbreaks. This must include a reserve of gas to provide this service on the island.::To emphasise that the well-being of our poultry farmers must be prioritised. Adequate compensation is not only a matter of fairness but also essential to maintaining the resilience and sustainability of our Agricultural sector. Failure to provide sufficient support undermines the Department's commitment to the poultry industry and places our farmers' livelihoods at immediate risk.::To propose the establishment of a base station for grandparent genetics in Ireland and importantly create additional slaughtering capacity for end of lay birds in light of the proposed new impending limits on transport times.::To request a joint meeting with Industry experts, IFA and the Department of Agriculture, Food, and the Marine to discuss how to move forward and address these issues effectively.",

There was subsequently the launch of a 10-point action plan to support calf to beef systems, but with absolutely no financial support provided for farmers.::To emphasise that, in detailed submissions to the Minister and his officials to the Food Vision groups last year and again to the consultation for the 10-point action plan earlier this year, IFA highlighted the absence of these supports for calf rearers and called for a payment of €100 per calf for farmers rearing calves from the dairy herd.::To point out that the current dairy beef scheme provides a payment to dairy farmers for breeding higher beef merit beef calves, but provides no funding to those who actually rear the calves. This is a mistake and must be resolved.::To call on the Minister for Agriculture, Food, And the Marine to come forward with a direct support payment of €100 per calf for farmers who are investing in rearing these calves. Many farmers entered into these enterprises on the belief that financial support for the rearer would be provided.",

Autumn 2023 born calves have now been sold and the opportunity to carry out the actions has passed. In particular, farmers with Autumn born weanlings were not provided with any clarification of the measures required to qualify, and as such are effectively frozen out.::To highlight that the inclusion of the maximum number of animals eligible for payment in the scheme is a serious issue for suckler farmers. “While the vast majority of suckler farmers have fewer than 40 cows, those with more than 40 cows and who are heavily dependent on the income from their suckler herd cannot be penalised. All suckler cows should qualify for the measures carried out.::To emphasise that the 2024 Beef Welfare Scheme is a vital support for suckler farmers.

For farmers one of the most important tools in delivering on this is access to competitively prices vaccines. Almost €40m is spent each year on vaccines, 23% or almost €10m of which is VAT that does not need to be applied.::To emphasise that there is now a real opportunity for Government to show if they truly support farmers and industry in reducing AMR or are they content to just pay lip service to reducing dependence on antibiotic usage while failing to provide meaningful support to assist farmers in reducing AMR at zero cost to the exchequer.::To stress that the Department of Agriculture also has a serious role to play in ensuring vaccine availability for farmers at critical times of the year and must up their game. Over the past number of years farmers have experienced increasing levels of certain vaccine shortages at critical usage times and the situation for a number of products is worse this year.::To highlight that the availability of vaccines when needed is critical for farmers in protecting and maintaining the health, welfare and productivity of the animals while reducing the needs for antibiotic usage. These actions are being severely hampered on farms by the failure of the Department of Agriculture to ensure that there are adequate supplies of suitable products available in the market place.::To highlight that these products are too important for farmers and to the health of the animals to be left to chance or commercial decisions of pharmaceutical companies or medicine suppliers, the Department of Agriculture must be more proactive in identifying early if there are to be supply issues or shortages and ensuring that these are addressed.::To call on the Minister for Agriculture to ensure his officials act immediately to address the shortages of important vaccines that farmers are encountering.",

The next CAP Programme will run from 2028-2032 and will align with a new Multi Financial Framework in the EU.::It is essential that a larger financial allocation is awarded to the Agriculture sector within the next MFF if farmers are to retain a decent standard of living, along with delivering environmental objectives.::Based on the IFAC Irish Farm Report for 2024, 34% of Irish tillage farmers and 31% of beef farmers stated they were unsure if they would still be farming in 5 years. A financially robust and workable CAP is essential to retain the strategic output of these sectors along with social cohesion in rural areas.::The 2021 – 2027 MFF reduced funding by 5% in CAP and 5% in Cohesion funding, this translates to a reduction of 12% in real terms relative to the previous MFF. It is therefore essential that Member States secure an increase in the CAP budget for the next programme period to secure a strategic future for all farmers.::The issues which have persisted for farmers in this mandate have culminated in the development of the Strategic Dialogue on Agriculture launched by Commission President Ursula Von der Leyen in 2024. This emphasises the importance of prioritising agriculture as a strategic sector in future policy developments which should be replicated in Ireland.::Irelands Nitrates Derogation::Ireland holds a significant competitive advantage in milk production compared with other EU member states or the UK. The key differential between Ireland and other EU countries is our grass-based system. Therefore, it is imperative this is protected at all costs. This also highlights the vital 3 IFA Submission – National Risk Assessment 2024 importance of retaining a nitrates derogation at an EU level.::Removal of the derogation will, overnight, eliminate the cost advantage we currently enjoy. It is likely to lead to more intensive system which relies more on imported feed and a higher fixed cost base thus reducing our environmental sustainability. It will also have highly negative effects on the Irish land market, inflating prices and creating increased competition among farmers for rented land.::However, it is likely that the milk price disadvantage that currently impacts Ireland will continue. A drift away from a grass-based system will lead to a significant loss of competitiveness, a parameter which has been recently highlighted that Europe must improve on overall. This can also be related to the high cost of doing business in Ireland due to high labour and energy costs relative to other Member States.::At the foundation of Ireland's competitive advantage is the Nitrates derogation which allows Irish farmers to maximise pasture utilisation. Any move away from this grass-based system will not only erode our competitive advantage but will likely place us at a competitive disadvantage compared to other countries. This can also be related to Irelands dairy processing sector which is designed to accommodate a seasonal supply pattern which the potential loss of the derogation threatens significantly.::Looking to the medium-term, the outlook for a demand\/supply prospective for dairy product is positive. Future milk supply is likely to be curtailed mainly due to environmental policy restrictions being imposed in Europe and beyond. Given how sustainable Irish dairy is across a range of categories, it is illogical to impose restrictions that stifles its competitiveness. It behoves all stakeholders within the industry to do their utmost to protect the sector and its associated competitiveness.::It is of major strategic importance that the Nitrates Derogation for Ireland is sustained post 2025 and that stakeholders are consulted in all dialogue with the Commission in regards to the state of play on the Nitrates Derogation moving forward.::2) Economic Risks - Disruption to a Secure and Sustainable Energy Supply::The agriculture sector has experienced price shocks in the supply of electricity and other fuels following Russia's invasion of Ukraine. This creates income volatility in the sector which must be strategically stabilised moving forward to mitigate other issues such as food price inflation.::While currently starting from a low infrastructure base, Irish agriculture is in a unique position to contribute effectively to Irelands energy security moving forward if the policy framework and capital investment are mobilised to support the sector. It is also a strategically important opportunity to help manage income risk on Irish farms as well as diversifying enterprises and meeting climate goals.::Investment in Agri-Photovoltaics can reduce the energy dependency of farms but can also to allow farmers to contribute to overall energy independence goals which has become a key strategic priority following Russia's invasion of Ukraine. There is massive capacity for micro-generation on Irish farms that needs to be heavily promoted through government policy.::Farms need capital grants to invest in solar panels but must also be allowed to gain an economic return from the electricity generated. The CAP can play a role in this but further capital grants for solar investment are required. Rules surrounding EU competition law should be revised to allow farmers contribute further to national energy security whilst still receiving capital grants.::Anaerobic digestion capacity of animal manures and other feed stocks like grass silage and tillage crops need to be massively scaled to help further reduce external energy dependencies. The planning law system needs to be conducive to the construction of farmer led bio-digestors and capital investment needs to be allocated to allow for farmer led projects.::As well as contributing to energy security, this system if established could help address external fertiliser dependencies, contribute to increased income security for farmers in more volatile markets and improve environmental parameters like water quality::A more strategic development plan must be developed for both Agri-Photovoltaics and Anaerobic Digestion in Ireland to promote these industries as the sectors currently lack a supportive fiscal policy framework to stimulate development. These frameworks are already common place in many EU Member states putting Ireland on a competitive backfoot. Examples of policy developments which would aid in facilitating AD would be set feed in rates, strike prices and dedicated capital allocations.::Ireland should utilise the extended EU Temporary Crisis and Transition Framework for State Aid allocations to invest in Anaerobic Digestion as has been done by multiple member states including France, Czechia and Italy.::There is a major external dependency on fertiliser in Ireland but also at an EU level, this issue was emphasised upon the invasion of Ukraine by Russia when fertiliser prices sky rocketed. Due to sanctions and elevated energy prices in Europe the price for farmers remains elevated. There is also the potential for market management and oligopoly structures within the EU fertiliser manufactures which must be investigated.::The EU anti-dumping levy applied to fertilisers should be removed to increase competition on the EU market just as the US removed this levy in 2022 to help lower prices for farmers.::The recent proposed revision of the Nitrates Directive to allow for 100kg\/Ha of RENURE Fertiliser to be spread in addition to the 170kg\/Ha organic stocking rate must be optimised for Ireland. Essential to this is scaling the number of Anaerobic digestors, the digestate produced from these facilities should qualify as RENURE and be allowed to be spread by farmers who wish to reduce their inorganic fertiliser load on the condition that digestate has been nutrient quantified::Overarchingly, environmental policy must be carefully developed and adapted to recognise the economic pressures Europe is facing in the face of geopolitical uncertainty. Strategic autonomy in essential resources such as energy and fertiliser must be prioritised and farmers can play a role in attaining this.::3) Concentration of Irelands Agricultural Enterprise Mix::Fruit and Vegetable Production::The number of field vegetable producers has dropped from 400 in 1998 to currently only 60 field vegetable producers in the country. International Vegetable and Fruit imports are a massive concern from a competition perspective as they reduce the viability of domestic producers. 83% of Irelands fruit and vegetables are imported but we know than 29% of them could be grown in Ireland for the Irish market if the position of Irish farmers was strategically improved within the supply chain.::Seasonal imports of fruit and vegetables that can be grown domestically make up 29% of total imports  potatoes (18%), apples (5%), and soft fruits (6%), according to a report by UCD. Any further decline of domestic production in horticulture must be prevented which will decrease Irelands overall food security. Imports, labour supply and energy costs are major challenges within the horticulture sector that must be strategically accessed.::The powers of the Agri-Food Regulator office should be increased through the 2025 revision of the Unfair Trading Practises Directive to further improve the position of farmers within the supply chain and prevent any further concentration of commodity production within the agriculture sector which will increase risk within the sector.::Other EU member states have a more powerful Agri- Food Regulator office when compared to Ireland and any actions which can increase transparency in the supply chain should be adopted with severe repercussions for breaches of the UTP Directive.::Tillage Sector::The area devoted to tillage declined by 16% between 2012 and 2020. A 6% recovery was recorded between 2020 and 2023 but 2024 is likely to see a further reduction in the area. Without urgent policy action, it is not inconceivable that the overall tillage area could decline by up to 11% in 2024 due to very low levels of autumn planting, tight availability of spring seeds and widespread negativity amongst growers.::This potential decrease comes on top of the 7% drop in the cereal area recorded in 2023 and a 26% reduction in overall volume produced (CSO). A double figure decline in area in 2024 could set a dangerous precedent for further declines into 2025 and beyond. Furthermore, the likelihood of achieving the proposed tillage area target of 400,000ha by 2030 as outlined in The Climate Action Plan is now extremely slim.::The effects of a declining tillage area indicates a strategic risk for the future of this sector and policy supports must be directed towards sustaining and growing the sector moving forward. The sector is essential to the distilling and malting industries in Ireland which are of major economic importance and the export market. The value of Irish drinks exports in 2022 was €2bn.::A reduction in the area of crops grown on the supply of fodder for the livestock sector must also be considered. Poor weather and a lack of supply for the 2023\/24 period directly effects the economics of the livestock sector in terms in terms of inputs. Sustaining and growing the tillage area is of paramount importance for the continuity of a domestic supply of fodder and feed.::Increased international imports of straw which may contain Black Grass or other invasive species are both a biodiversity and phytosanitary risk to Ireland which must be minimised. The immediate announcement of a Tillage Survival Scheme with a robust payment per hectare is of essential strategic importance for preventing any further decline in this area::Land Market Disruption::IFA has continually highlighted the potential market disruption which may occur from any further reduction in Irelands Nitrates Derogation moving forward. It is imperative to consider the effects that the loss of the derogation may have on the mix of Irelands agricultural enterprises.::The modelling below conducted by IFA analysis indicates that derogation farmers would require approximately 81,135 additional hectares of additional land to comply with the reduced organic N level of 170 kg\/ha. To put this in context, this is an area larger than the county of Carlow which has c. 70,209 hectares of utilisable agricultural area (CSO).::This scenario would result in highly inflated land market prices and the potential loss of land by lower income farmers particularly in the beef and tillage sectors resulting in a concentration of the enterprise mix in rural Ireland stimulating further economic uncertainty.::Third Country Trade Deals::Whilst Irelands Agriculture sector is largely export oriented, competition on International and EU markets from third country imports due to trade deals from other large agricultural producers threaten the viability of Irelands rural enterprise mix moving forward. Irish farmers have made consistent strides to valorise their products in a sustainable manner through the uptake of environmentally friendly practises and high animal welfare.::Evidence of this can be seen in the trust of consumers internationally and the granting of a Protected Geographical Indicator for Irish beef in 2023. The uptake and maintenance of high environmental standards in Ireland often comes at a cost for farmers and they can struggle to compete with international imports from countries with lower environmental restrictions and economies of scale.::It is essential to protect Irish produce from cheap agricultural imports that depress market prices. Future EU trade deals with MERCOSUR and Australia should be approached with caution from an agricultural perspective to protect the economic viability of Irish farms to ensure the enterprise mix of rural Ireland does not become homogenous.::Other EU member states have begun to take steps towards protecting the enterprise mix of their rural areas such as the Agricultural Sovereignty Bill recently passed by the French Government to ensure Agricultural Viability is sustained and optimised moving forward.::4) Protectionism and Deglobalisation::Irelands agriculture sector is highly export oriented which is essential to the economic success of the sector. Any threats to current trade pathways must be minimised to preserve the economic drivers of this success which play a role in other aspects of strategic importance like rural development and employment. 90% of Irish Dairy, Beef and Sheep Meat are exported and thus any barriers to trade in these sustainably produced commodities must be counteracted.::Animal Feeds::In 2022, 6.5 million tonnes of animal feed were imported into Ireland, there is a significant reliance on Canada and Brazil for maize meal and on the UK for cereal grains. External to this was 3 million tonnes of high protein animal feeds which was imported to Ireland, around 75% is coming from outside the EU, this includes the USA, UK, Brazil and Argentina. Barley, Wheat and Maize Meal imports all increased in 2022.::There is an EU wide objective to increase the production of Protein Crops in Europe which is strategically important and incentivised in Ireland via the Protein Payment under the CAP. This should be further optimised through better crop varieties and understanding of the nutritional qualities of Irish produced protein crops. The maintenance of a high per hectare payment for protein crops is imperative to promoting protein autonomy.::Europe struggles to produce high protein quality crops that can be essential for modern animal nutrition and welfare, a compromise needs to be determined in relation to the EU Deforestation Regulation which may impact the import of these essential protein feeds. This could have significant price impacts for farmers paying for animal feeds that must be minimised to prevent further income volatility.::Live exports::The live export of cattle (including calves) is of critical importance to the Agricultural livestock sector in Ireland. In 2022, Ireland exported 282,293 live cattle of which 151,735 (53.7%) were calves under 6 weeks of age. Our main export destinations in Europe are the Netherlands, Spain and Italy while outside the EU, a much smaller number of cattle are traded with Libya, Turkey and Northern Ireland.::Live exports constituted a value of €230 million in 2022, 6% of the overall €4 billion generated by the Irish meat and livestock export sector which forms an important corner stone of Irish rural economies.::One of the core benefits of being an EU member state is the ability to trade goods freely across the EU. This continuity of trade extends to the movement of animals. Unfortunately, because of Ireland's peripheral island location in Europe long distance travel is inevitable if we wish to export live cattle to mainland Europe.::The maintenance of an understanding to reflect our necessity to move cattle by sea is critical, so as to not discriminate Ireland against an ability to trade freely with other EU member states within the single market and not to distort competition. Long journeys can add stress to livestock and so we must continue to adopt measures that minimise any stress endured that are economically feasible.::If the Regulation currently governing livestock exports is revised to exclude Ireland from exporting animals due to decreased journey times, it may not be consistent with Article 36 of the Functioning Treaty of the European Union, which states ‘prohibitions or restrictions shall not constitute a means of arbitrary discrimination or a disguised restriction on trade between member states'.::The European Council Directive 98\/58\/EC (Protection of Animals kept for Farming Purposes) states that distortion of competition arising from different animal welfare provisions applied by the EU and some other non-EU countries must be eliminated. It is of essential strategic importance to preserve the live export link Ireland currently utilises into the future especially in the context of a revision of Animal Transport legislation which is expected in the next European Parliament mandate.::Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism::Ireland has no domestic fertiliser production facility and the inclusion of fertiliser and other farm inputs like steel in the Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism (CBAM) has the potential to inflate input prices for farmers upon its full implementation in 2026.::If there is no increase in the price paid by processors or retailers for farm produce, farmers will pay the cost for this trade mechanism. Stringent monitoring must be enforced on the effect of the Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism (CBAM) on farm inputs to prevent further increases in input cost volatility for farmers.::Dairy and Meat Exports::Irelands competitive advantage in sustainable meat and dairy product production must be preserved in order to compete on highly globalised markets with lower environmental standards. As emphasised in relation to Irelands strategic retention of a Nitrates Derogation, European and National policy should not hinder the economic stability of these sectors in relation to exports. Since 2015, over €2.2bn was invested by dairy farmers and over €1.3bn invested by milk processors in the sector.::This investment has had knock-on benefits to the broader economy. Crucially, for every €1 of dairy product exported, 90c is spent within the Irish economy. In contrast, 10c per euro exported by the multinational sector is reinvested in the Irish economy. In 2022, dairy exports amounted to €6.8bn.::As traditional dairy and beef markets for Ireland begin to scale their own production as well as EU dairy production expanding eastwards, it is strategically important for Ireland to explore other trade avenues for exports to retain the economic importance and viability of these sectors. Irelands role as a major exporter of sustainable animal-based products may be further compromised by labour constraints, market volatility and higher environmental standards.::It is important to recognise that global demand for protein is estimated to grow by up to 78% by 2050. In 2023, Rabobank has identified that if lower margins in dairy production run parallel with compromising environmental targets, milk production in North Western Europe may decline by up to 20%. Coherent policy development, strong trade development and product marketing will be essential for Irelands Dairy and Meat sectors moving forward to reaffirm their position on competitive global markets.::5) Environmental Risks - Extreme Weather Events and Natural Disasters::Farmers are at the frontline of climate change and the effects are felt directly on the operation of their businesses. In combination with mitigation and prevention measures, separate state aid funding must be adequately and quickly distributed to farmers in times of economic need due to the increasing pressure of unpredictable weather. Strategic funding should be allocated to national crisis reserves that can help improve cash flow for farmers during times of need.::Food Safety and Security::Food safety is a heavily regulated component of European Health Policy which is directly related to how food is produced at farm level. Irish crop production for both human and animal uses is observed stringently for mycotoxins which can cause major disruption if they enter the food chain. Plant protection products are essential to controlling these toxins and any policy which prevents their use must be strategically evaluated.::The increasing evolution of pesticide regulation at an EU level has also begun to discourage the activity of the European Biotechnology industry who develops pesticides for agricultural use within the EU. The average time frame in which it takes companies to develop new pesticides has increased to an average of 11.4 years and the rate of new actives reaching the market has decreased from 4 in 1995 to 1.4 in 2014.::This is largely due to the high cost of development and testing which now requires over €215 million euro to get an active ingredient to market, representing an increase of 11.7% from 2005 costs alone. At the end of 2021 there was 215 active substances listed for the renewal process in the EU yet only 158 applications had been submitted, signifying that at least 60 of the 476 approved substances in the EU would not be renewed.::By the end of 2018 there was also a list of 100 potentially new active substances that were required to be tested under the regulatory framework that remained shelved due to the incoherency in the substitution system.::This irregularity in policy not only results in actives being retracted with no substitution, but exemplifies the grievances plant protection companies and farmers have with the Commissions regulatory process which has downstream effects for farmers wishing to protect their yields and income.::It also identifies a clear weakness in the Commission's proposals for new biological plant protection products to replace current chemistry as the regulatory framework is inhibitory to their ability to reach markets for farmers.::Irish crop production operates in a high disease pressure environment and if farmers are to access emerging human value chains for crops, they require plant protection products to ensure they are not hindered by Minimum residue levels for mycotoxins which are becoming increasingly stringent.::It is strategically important to communicate this food safety requirement when developing potential pesticide control policies. Minimisation of the number of actives farmers can access is also a poor anti-resistance and integrated pest management strategy.",

We note that this review group was superseded by the Cooley farmers' legal action - which, as you know, went to the Supreme Court.::To also note that the Supreme Court, by unanimous decision, found that the interpretation of 'compensation' by the Department was inaccurate and they should have taken all losses into account, to include consequential loss.::To emphasise that it is somewhat disingenuous of the Department now to seek to rely upon a time limit when the Supreme Court has held that the Department's interpretation was clearly wrong. Indeed, the interpretation that many of IFA members have taken, and indeed have sought, was that consequential losses needed to be taken into account when finalising compensation.::To draw attention to a letter by the Principal officer in the Departments Animal Health Division, which he sent to farmers in the Cooley peninsula in June 2001 where he acknowledges “a number of flock owners in The Cooley area expressed dissatisfaction with the values” .::In that letter he also acknowledges “that in the context of the F&M situation on the Cooley Peninsula with which all concerned had to deal at speed and under considerable pressure, it was perhaps inevitable that some anomalies would arise”.::To highlight that farmers were willing to and did engage with the Departments own process, only to have this deferred and the opportunity to conclude not provided. We are fully satisfied that many of the farmers relied upon the statements made by the then Taoiseach, other Ministers and Department officials, that the matter would ultimately be reviewed.::To ask that the Department does not hide behind legal technicalities at this stage and reviews the various outstanding claims, to take into account consequential loss. It is also disingenuous and infuriating for farmers in Cooley to be told in correspondence that they were satisfied with the levels of compensation provided when they did not partake in the legal proceedings issued by some farmers at that time.::To emphasise that farmers chose in good faith, having cooperated in full with the cull in the greater national interest, to pursue their grievances through negotiation with the Department represented by IFA.::To highlight that the approach adopted to-date by the Department in resolving the issues for these farmers following conclusion of the legal proceedings, proceedings which were used by officials at that time to suspend negotiations with IFA on behalf of these farmers, challenges how events may play out when issues of this nature arise in the future and has severely damaged the trust of these farmers in their political representatives and the Department of Agriculture.::To highlight that the files of a large number of farmers also show categorically they were not satisfied with the levels of compensation provided and were actively seeking increased payments through all avenues available to them.::To require the Minister, who now has an opportunity to right this wrong and ensure all farmers on the Cooley Peninsula, who suffered the extraordinary psychological and financial impact of having their entire flocks culled to protect the country from an extension to the Foot & Mouth outbreak are treated fairly, equally and consistent with the findings of the Supreme Court.",

    "Intended Results":"To highlight that much of the updates relate to increased annual expenditure across individual schemes; minor changes (e.g. NRN changing to CAP Network Ireland) and\/or reporting on activities carried out throughout year.::To highlight that Ireland's percentage drawdown for EU funding (EAFRD & EURI) stood at 94.08% (vs. EU average 79.62%). Public expenditure on the RDP fell from €670m in 2022 to €208.4m in 2023.::To highlight that the biggest contributor to Focus Area 1A was Measure 1  KT Groups (training for the Beef Data and Genomics Programme (BDGP) and Green Low Carbon Agri-Environment Programme (GLAS) participants). Clarification is needed on what plans\/actions are being undertaken to increase beyond current standing (87% of 2025 target) given these schemes are closed for application.::To emphasise that, with reference to Focus Area 1B (strengthening linkages between agriculture, food production and forestry, and research and innovation thereby improving environmental management and performance) loss of a European Innovation Partnership (EIP) in an area can be damaging to both economic & environmental gains made during the project timeframe (e.g. Burren Scheme).::To propose that a new 'Farming for Habitat and Farming for Species' payment needs to be introduced to maximise environmental gain and compensate farmers who suffered a loss in income when the Hen Harrier; Pearl Mussel; Burren Schemes etc. ended, and\/or subsequent EIPs finish up.::To propose that, for strategic important EIPs (e.g. FarmPEAT) - additional funding should be found to extend these projects beyond the 5-year timeframe and\/or allow expansion to other areas.::To question what  the expected timeline is for publication of the European Innovation Partnership (EIP) spending review? With regard same, part of the assessment should focus on how much funding is directly received by participating farmers visa vie other stakeholders\/paying agencies involved. It is essential leakage of funds away from primary producers is minimised in all instances.::To require clarification re Focus Area 1C (concerned with fostering lifelong learning & vocational training in the Ag\/For sectors), and likelihood of scaling up activity to reach 2025 target.::To question why no payments were made in 2023 under TAMS III. This is simply unacceptable. A full review is required and corrective strategies implemented to ensure such stifled on-farm investment and vacuum of information does not occur again. Processing of applications and payment claims needs to be simplified.::To emphasise that there needs to be minimisation of bureaucracy\/verification to speed up the process and help ensure all funding is fully utilised. Any unused funding within the Targeted Agricultural Modernisation Scheme (TAMS) must be retained and re-circulated for future tranches to support on-farm investment.::To highlight that, to keep in line with current levels of inflation, investment ceilings most be increased further and costings must be index linked and\/or updated at least annually. Targeted Agricultural Modernisation Scheme (TAMS) reference costs remain very much out of kilter with prevailing costs of materials. This may significantly limit the number of farmers applying for TAMS support.

    "Subject Matter":"Emergency Authorisation for Herbicide",
    "Intended Results":"To request an emergency authorisation for use of the herbicide Debut (active ingredient triflusulfuron-methyl) for use in fodder and sugar beet crops in Spring 2025. The existing label registration for Debut expired on 20th May 2024 with use-up date of August 20th 2024.::To highlight that fodder and sugar beet is a small but very important crop for tillage and livestock farmers. The area planted has been consistent for a number of years at approximately 9,000ha, the vast majority of this is produced by specialist growers in Munster and southeast Leinster.Beet is excellent winter feed for livestock, producing the highest dry matter and energy of all forage crops.::It is also fosters and improves cooperation between tillage and livestock farmers which is to be welcomed.::To emphasise that weed control is the most critical management intervention in beet production, as beet is a notoriously poor competitor with weeds. It is widely acknowledged that poor weed control is a major cause of yield losses and crop failure in beet crops.::- The management of weeds in beet has been traditionally based on a little and often approach with herbicides, utilising a range of contact and residual active ingredients targeting weed species which are small and actively emerging.::- The loss of active ingredients such as chloridizan and desmedipham in the past decade forced an industry wide move towards the use of Debut based programmes in combination with other residual and contact based actives such as ethofumosate, lenacil, metamitron and phenmedipham which delivered cost effective, sustainable results with no crop damage.::To Highlight that Debut is the only herbicide which controls weeds such as charlock and volunteer oilseed rape in conventional sugar and fodder beet crops. These weeds are endemic and reoccur annually in arable fields. Populations of these weeds have increased due to the increase in winter oilseed rape production in recent years and also the use of brassica species in winter cover crop mixtures.::- The use of Debut alongside the above-mentioned active ingredients also allows full control of a range of weeds that are poorly controlled by the other individual active ingredients such as bindweed, knotgrass, redshank, field-pansy and speedwell.::- The inclusion of Debut in a typical beet herbicide programme significantly reduces the amount of active ingredient required on a per-hectare basis down from 6446g\/ha to 3503g\/ha. Please see attached appendix for full details on this calculation.::To demonstrate that the withdrawal of triflusulfuron-methyl containing products such as Debut post 2024 will have a significant, detrimental effect on fodder\/sugar beet growers including::To highlight that the viability of conventional beet production in fields with high infestations of charlock and volunteer Oilseed rape will be wiped out overnight.::To highlight that any potential growth in fodder or sugar beet as a native, high dry-matter feed source for livestock will be stunted.::To emphasise that beet grower margins will be lower due to the requirement to use significantly more expensive, lower yielding Conviso varieties.::To demonstrate that there will be a higher loading and more frequent use of other pesticide active ingredients on per hectare basis annually.::To highlight that alternatives to Debut for controlling endemic weeds such as volunteer oilseed rape, charlock weed species include Conviso Smart, sugar beet varieties bred with Clearfield technology to tolerant use of an in-crop ALS herbicide Conviso One.::Any subsequent weed beet from Conviso varieties is tolerant to ALS herbicides and must be controlled by older chemistry such as MCPA and 2,4-D which have a less favourable environmental profile. Conviso varieties are more costly, lower yielding and are only available as sugar beet rather than fodder beet varieties at present.::To stress that the inclusion of inter-row cultivators and laser guided hoes in the Targeted Agricultural Modernisation Scheme (TAMS) is welcome. However, the purchase of laser guided equipment is simply not justifiable for the small areas of beet that the majority of Irish growers typically produce on an annual basis.::To request an emergency authorisation for the use of Debut in beet crops during Spring 2025Due to the lack of suitable alternatives.",

    "Intended Results":"To highlight concerns about the level of fodder produced year to date at a national level ahead of this winter.::To propose that, due to the introduction of the fertiliser register and the mixed messages communicated by the Department of Agriculture relating to 2024 inorganic nitrogen (N) allowances, farmers are in the dark on how much fertiliser they can spread for the remainder of 2024.::Livestock farmers should be provided with inorganic N statements similar to organic N statements currently provided with immediate effect. This would allow farmers to establish how much additional fertiliser they can apply for the remainder of the growing season and encourage many to apply inorganic N in a safe manner that maximises forage production on their farms.::To highlight that it is imperative we maximise the production of fodder via catch crops this Autumn\/Winter. IFA propose per provisions within Commission agreed CAP Simplification Package, provide a temporary derogation (in full) from GAEC-6 conditionality requirements, specifically the 30% lie-back requirement on growing of catch crops.::To propose the introduction of a scheme similar to the 2018 Fodder Incentive Measure which incentivised tillage farmers to plant catch crops and short duration temporary grass species. This measure will require changes to GAEC 6 as outlined above in order to have a material impact.::To highlight that currently, farmers who opt for the catch crops option under ACRES can only graze these crops after January 1st. Consideration should be given to facilitating an earlier grazing date thereby giving farmers increased flexibility to maximise utilisation of these crops.::To highlight that the whole-cropping of silage from late sown barley and oat crops offers another opportunity to generate additional fodder. This option needs to be promoted widely to farmers. There should also be engagement with appropriate stakeholders (e.g. co-operatives) who could facilitate agreements between tillage and livestock farmers for these crops.::To propose that further support is required to facilitate the transport of fodder from surplus to deficit areas. Accordingly, IFA is seeking the re-introduction of the Fodder Transport Subsidy Scheme launched in Spring 2024 with consideration given to extending the support to all forage types.::To highlight that cashflow is particularly tight on farms currently owing to high input costs and falling output prices. It is imperative that financial institutions provide maximum flexibility to farmers in terms of provision of low-cost working capital as well as restructuring existing short-term borrowings where required. Direct engagement with banks and other financial providers should take place immediately to ensure farmers are properly supported financially.::To seek a meeting with the Minister for Agriculture, Food, and the Marine to discuss IFA proposals.",

    "Subject Matter":"National Risk Assessment 2024",
    "Intended Results":"To welcome the publishing of the 2024 National Risk Assessment Report::1) Geopolitical Risks - Future Direction of the EU::The end of the 2019-2024 European Mandate was marked by multiple Farmer led protests across many member states due to disillusionment with the level of environmental regulation on agricultural policy.::To retain cohesion among farmers across Europe and Ireland, it is of major strategic importance to develop policy that supports farmers in their production rather than hindering the development of their enterprises which have also come under threat from increasing market volatility and input price shocks, of key importance to this are a workable Common Agricultural Policy and the maintenance of Irelands Nitrates Derogation post 2025.::Common Agricultural Policy::The 2023-27 CAP programme proposed and implemented a number of compromising policy decisions for Irish farmers including elevated levels of convergence, unworkable levels of cross compliance and delayed payment schedules which created cash flow issues on many Irish farms.::The next EU mandate must build further on the recent simplification of the Common Agricultural Policy to retain the strategic position of Agriculture within the European Economy of which Ireland plays an essential role. The next CAP Programme will run from 2028-2032 and will align with a new Multi Financial Framework in the EU.::It is essential that a larger financial allocation is awarded to the Agriculture sector within the next MFF if farmers are to retain a decent standard of living, along with delivering environmental objectives.::Based on the IFAC Irish Farm Report for 2024, 34% of Irish tillage farmers and 31% of beef farmers stated they were unsure if they would still be farming in 5 years. A financially robust and workable CAP is essential to retain the strategic output of these sectors along with social cohesion in rural areas.::The 2021 – 2027 MFF reduced funding by 5% in CAP and 5% in Cohesion funding, this translates to a reduction of 12% in real terms relative to the previous MFF. It is therefore essential that Member States secure an increase in the CAP budget for the next programme period to secure a strategic future for all farmers.::The issues which have persisted for farmers in this mandate have culminated in the development of the Strategic Dialogue on Agriculture launched by Commission President Ursula Von der Leyen in 2024. This emphasises the importance of prioritising agriculture as a strategic sector in future policy developments which should be replicated in Ireland.::Irelands Nitrates Derogation::Ireland holds a significant competitive advantage in milk production compared with other EU member states or the UK. The key differential between Ireland and other EU countries is our grass-based system. Therefore, it is imperative this is protected at all costs. This also highlights the vital 3 IFA Submission – National Risk Assessment 2024 importance of retaining a nitrates derogation at an EU level.::Removal of the derogation will, overnight, eliminate the cost advantage we currently enjoy. It is likely to lead to more intensive system which relies more on imported feed and a higher fixed cost base thus reducing our environmental sustainability. It will also have highly negative effects on the Irish land market, inflating prices and creating increased competition among farmers for rented land.::However, it is likely that the milk price disadvantage that currently impacts Ireland will continue. A drift away from a grass-based system will lead to a significant loss of competitiveness, a parameter which has been recently highlighted that Europe must improve on overall. This can also be related to the high cost of doing business in Ireland due to high labour and energy costs relative to other Member States.::At the foundation of Ireland's competitive advantage is the Nitrates derogation which allows Irish farmers to maximise pasture utilisation. Any move away from this grass-based system will not only erode our competitive advantage but will likely place us at a competitive disadvantage compared to other countries. This can also be related to Irelands dairy processing sector which is designed to accommodate a seasonal supply pattern which the potential loss of the derogation threatens significantly.::Looking to the medium-term, the outlook for a demand\/supply prospective for dairy product is positive. Future milk supply is likely to be curtailed mainly due to environmental policy restrictions being imposed in Europe and beyond. Given how sustainable Irish dairy is across a range of categories, it is illogical to impose restrictions that stifles its competitiveness. It behoves all stakeholders within the industry to do their utmost to protect the sector and its associated competitiveness.::It is of major strategic importance that the Nitrates Derogation for Ireland is sustained post 2025 and that stakeholders are consulted in all dialogue with the Commission in regards to the state of play on the Nitrates Derogation moving forward.::2) Economic Risks - Disruption to a Secure and Sustainable Energy Supply::The agriculture sector has experienced price shocks in the supply of electricity and other fuels following Russia's invasion of Ukraine. This creates income volatility in the sector which must be strategically stabilised moving forward to mitigate other issues such as food price inflation.::While currently starting from a low infrastructure base, Irish agriculture is in a unique position to contribute effectively to Irelands energy security moving forward if the policy framework and capital investment are mobilised to support the sector. It is also a strategically important opportunity to help manage income risk on Irish farms as well as diversifying enterprises and meeting climate goals.::Investment in Agri-Photovoltaics can reduce the energy dependency of farms but can also to allow farmers to contribute to overall energy independence goals which has become a key strategic priority following Russia's invasion of Ukraine. There is massive capacity for micro-generation on Irish farms that needs to be heavily promoted through government policy.::Farms need capital grants to invest in solar panels but must also be allowed to gain an economic return from the electricity generated. The CAP can play a role in this but further capital grants for solar investment are required. Rules surrounding EU competition law should be revised to allow farmers contribute further to national energy security whilst still receiving capital grants.::Anaerobic digestion capacity of animal manures and other feed stocks like grass silage and tillage crops need to be massively scaled to help further reduce external energy dependencies. The planning law system needs to be conducive to the construction of farmer led bio-digestors and capital investment needs to be allocated to allow for farmer led projects.::As well as contributing to energy security, this system if established could help address external fertiliser dependencies, contribute to increased income security for farmers in more volatile markets and improve environmental parameters like water quality::A more strategic development plan must be developed for both Agri-Photovoltaics and Anaerobic Digestion in Ireland to promote these industries as the sectors currently lack a supportive fiscal policy framework to stimulate development. These frameworks are already common place in many EU Member states putting Ireland on a competitive backfoot. Examples of policy developments which would aid in facilitating AD would be set feed in rates, strike prices and dedicated capital allocations.::Ireland should utilise the extended EU Temporary Crisis and Transition Framework for State Aid allocations to invest in Anaerobic Digestion as has been done by multiple member states including France, Czechia and Italy.::There is a major external dependency on fertiliser in Ireland but also at an EU level, this issue was emphasised upon the invasion of Ukraine by Russia when fertiliser prices sky rocketed. Due to sanctions and elevated energy prices in Europe the price for farmers remains elevated. There is also the potential for market management and oligopoly structures within the EU fertiliser manufactures which must be investigated.::The EU anti-dumping levy applied to fertilisers should be removed to increase competition on the EU market just as the US removed this levy in 2022 to help lower prices for farmers.::The recent proposed revision of the Nitrates Directive to allow for 100kg\/Ha of RENURE Fertiliser to be spread in addition to the 170kg\/Ha organic stocking rate must be optimised for Ireland. Essential to this is scaling the number of Anaerobic digestors, the digestate produced from these facilities should qualify as RENURE and be allowed to be spread by farmers who wish to reduce their inorganic fertiliser load on the condition that digestate has been nutrient quantified::Overarchingly, environmental policy must be carefully developed and adapted to recognise the economic pressures Europe is facing in the face of geopolitical uncertainty. Strategic autonomy in essential resources such as energy and fertiliser must be prioritised and farmers can play a role in attaining this.::3) Concentration of Irelands Agricultural Enterprise Mix::Fruit and Vegetable Production::The number of field vegetable producers has dropped from 400 in 1998 to currently only 60 field vegetable producers in the country. International Vegetable and Fruit imports are a massive concern from a competition perspective as they reduce the viability of domestic producers. 83% of Irelands fruit and vegetables are imported but we know than 29% of them could be grown in Ireland for the Irish market if the position of Irish farmers was strategically improved within the supply chain.::Seasonal imports of fruit and vegetables that can be grown domestically make up 29% of total imports  potatoes (18%), apples (5%), and soft fruits (6%), according to a report by UCD. Any further decline of domestic production in horticulture must be prevented which will decrease Irelands overall food security. Imports, labour supply and energy costs are major challenges within the horticulture sector that must be strategically accessed.::The powers of the Agri-Food Regulator office should be increased through the 2025 revision of the Unfair Trading Practises Directive to further improve the position of farmers within the supply chain and prevent any further concentration of commodity production within the agriculture sector which will increase risk within the sector.::Other EU member states have a more powerful Agri- Food Regulator office when compared to Ireland and any actions which can increase transparency in the supply chain should be adopted with severe repercussions for breaches of the UTP Directive.::Tillage Sector::The area devoted to tillage declined by 16% between 2012 and 2020. A 6% recovery was recorded between 2020 and 2023 but 2024 is likely to see a further reduction in the area. Without urgent policy action, it is not inconceivable that the overall tillage area could decline by up to 11% in 2024 due to very low levels of autumn planting, tight availability of spring seeds and widespread negativity amongst growers.::This potential decrease comes on top of the 7% drop in the cereal area recorded in 2023 and a 26% reduction in overall volume produced (CSO). A double figure decline in area in 2024 could set a dangerous precedent for further declines into 2025 and beyond. Furthermore, the likelihood of achieving the proposed tillage area target of 400,000ha by 2030 as outlined in The Climate Action Plan is now extremely slim.::The effects of a declining tillage area indicates a strategic risk for the future of this sector and policy supports must be directed towards sustaining and growing the sector moving forward. The sector is essential to the distilling and malting industries in Ireland which are of major economic importance and the export market. The value of Irish drinks exports in 2022 was €2bn.::A reduction in the area of crops grown on the supply of fodder for the livestock sector must also be considered. Poor weather and a lack of supply for the 2023\/24 period directly effects the economics of the livestock sector in terms in terms of inputs. Sustaining and growing the tillage area is of paramount importance for the continuity of a domestic supply of fodder and feed.::Increased international imports of straw which may contain Black Grass or other invasive species are both a biodiversity and phytosanitary risk to Ireland which must be minimised. The immediate announcement of a Tillage Survival Scheme with a robust payment per hectare is of essential strategic importance for preventing any further decline in this area::Land Market Disruption::IFA has continually highlighted the potential market disruption which may occur from any further reduction in Irelands Nitrates Derogation moving forward. It is imperative to consider the effects that the loss of the derogation may have on the mix of Irelands agricultural enterprises.::The modelling below conducted by IFA analysis indicates that derogation farmers would require approximately 81,135 additional hectares of additional land to comply with the reduced organic N level of 170 kg\/ha. To put this in context, this is an area larger than the county of Carlow which has c. 70,209 hectares of utilisable agricultural area (CSO).::This scenario would result in highly inflated land market prices and the potential loss of land by lower income farmers particularly in the beef and tillage sectors resulting in a concentration of the enterprise mix in rural Ireland stimulating further economic uncertainty.::Third Country Trade Deals::Whilst Irelands Agriculture sector is largely export oriented, competition on International and EU markets from third country imports due to trade deals from other large agricultural producers threaten the viability of Irelands rural enterprise mix moving forward. Irish farmers have made consistent strides to valorise their products in a sustainable manner through the uptake of environmentally friendly practises and high animal welfare.::Evidence of this can be seen in the trust of consumers internationally and the granting of a Protected Geographical Indicator for Irish beef in 2023. The uptake and maintenance of high environmental standards in Ireland often comes at a cost for farmers and they can struggle to compete with international imports from countries with lower environmental restrictions and economies of scale.::It is essential to protect Irish produce from cheap agricultural imports that depress market prices. Future EU trade deals with MERCOSUR and Australia should be approached with caution from an agricultural perspective to protect the economic viability of Irish farms to ensure the enterprise mix of rural Ireland does not become homogenous.::Other EU member states have begun to take steps towards protecting the enterprise mix of their rural areas such as the Agricultural Sovereignty Bill recently passed by the French Government to ensure Agricultural Viability is sustained and optimised moving forward.::4) Protectionism and Deglobalisation::Irelands agriculture sector is highly export oriented which is essential to the economic success of the sector. Any threats to current trade pathways must be minimised to preserve the economic drivers of this success which play a role in other aspects of strategic importance like rural development and employment. 90% of Irish Dairy, Beef and Sheep Meat are exported and thus any barriers to trade in these sustainably produced commodities must be counteracted.::Animal Feeds::In 2022, 6.5 million tonnes of animal feed were imported into Ireland, there is a significant reliance on Canada and Brazil for maize meal and on the UK for cereal grains. External to this was 3 million tonnes of high protein animal feeds which was imported to Ireland, around 75% is coming from outside the EU, this includes the USA, UK, Brazil and Argentina. Barley, Wheat and Maize Meal imports all increased in 2022.::There is an EU wide objective to increase the production of Protein Crops in Europe which is strategically important and incentivised in Ireland via the Protein Payment under the CAP. This should be further optimised through better crop varieties and understanding of the nutritional qualities of Irish produced protein crops. The maintenance of a high per hectare payment for protein crops is imperative to promoting protein autonomy.::Europe struggles to produce high protein quality crops that can be essential for modern animal nutrition and welfare, a compromise needs to be determined in relation to the EU Deforestation Regulation which may impact the import of these essential protein feeds. This could have significant price impacts for farmers paying for animal feeds that must be minimised to prevent further income volatility.::Live exports::The live export of cattle (including calves) is of critical importance to the Agricultural livestock sector in Ireland. In 2022, Ireland exported 282,293 live cattle of which 151,735 (53.7%) were calves under 6 weeks of age. Our main export destinations in Europe are the Netherlands, Spain and Italy while outside the EU, a much smaller number of cattle are traded with Libya, Turkey and Northern Ireland.::Live exports constituted a value of €230 million in 2022, 6% of the overall €4 billion generated by the Irish meat and livestock export sector which forms an important corner stone of Irish rural economies.::One of the core benefits of being an EU member state is the ability to trade goods freely across the EU. This continuity of trade extends to the movement of animals. Unfortunately, because of Ireland's peripheral island location in Europe long distance travel is inevitable if we wish to export live cattle to mainland Europe.::The maintenance of an understanding to reflect our necessity to move cattle by sea is critical, so as to not discriminate Ireland against an ability to trade freely with other EU member states within the single market and not to distort competition. Long journeys can add stress to livestock and so we must continue to adopt measures that minimise any stress endured that are economically feasible.::If the Regulation currently governing livestock exports is revised to exclude Ireland from exporting animals due to decreased journey times, it may not be consistent with Article 36 of the Functioning Treaty of the European Union, which states ‘prohibitions or restrictions shall not constitute a means of arbitrary discrimination or a disguised restriction on trade between member states'.::The European Council Directive 98\/58\/EC (Protection of Animals kept for Farming Purposes) states that distortion of competition arising from different animal welfare provisions applied by the EU and some other non-EU countries must be eliminated. It is of essential strategic importance to preserve the live export link Ireland currently utilises into the future especially in the context of a revision of Animal Transport legislation which is expected in the next European Parliament mandate.::Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism::Ireland has no domestic fertiliser production facility and the inclusion of fertiliser and other farm inputs like steel in the Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism (CBAM) has the potential to inflate input prices for farmers upon its full implementation in 2026.::If there is no increase in the price paid by processors or retailers for farm produce, farmers will pay the cost for this trade mechanism. Stringent monitoring must be enforced on the effect of the Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism (CBAM) on farm inputs to prevent further increases in input cost volatility for farmers.::Dairy and Meat Exports::Irelands competitive advantage in sustainable meat and dairy product production must be preserved in order to compete on highly globalised markets with lower environmental standards. As emphasised in relation to Irelands strategic retention of a Nitrates Derogation, European and National policy should not hinder the economic stability of these sectors in relation to exports. Since 2015, over €2.2bn was invested by dairy farmers and over €1.3bn invested by milk processors in the sector.::This investment has had knock-on benefits to the broader economy. Crucially, for every €1 of dairy product exported, 90c is spent within the Irish economy. In contrast, 10c per euro exported by the multinational sector is reinvested in the Irish economy. In 2022, dairy exports amounted to €6.8bn.::As traditional dairy and beef markets for Ireland begin to scale their own production as well as EU dairy production expanding eastwards, it is strategically important for Ireland to explore other trade avenues for exports to retain the economic importance and viability of these sectors. Irelands role as a major exporter of sustainable animal-based products may be further compromised by labour constraints, market volatility and higher environmental standards.::It is important to recognise that global demand for protein is estimated to grow by up to 78% by 2050. In 2023, Rabobank has identified that if lower margins in dairy production run parallel with compromising environmental targets, milk production in North Western Europe may decline by up to 20%. Coherent policy development, strong trade development and product marketing will be essential for Irelands Dairy and Meat sectors moving forward to reaffirm their position on competitive global markets.::5) Environmental Risks - Extreme Weather Events and Natural Disasters::Farmers are at the frontline of climate change and the effects are felt directly on the operation of their businesses. In combination with mitigation and prevention measures, separate state aid funding must be adequately and quickly distributed to farmers in times of economic need due to the increasing pressure of unpredictable weather. Strategic funding should be allocated to national crisis reserves that can help improve cash flow for farmers during times of need.::Food Safety and Security::Food safety is a heavily regulated component of European Health Policy which is directly related to how food is produced at farm level. Irish crop production for both human and animal uses is observed stringently for mycotoxins which can cause major disruption if they enter the food chain. Plant protection products are essential to controlling these toxins and any policy which prevents their use must be strategically evaluated.::The increasing evolution of pesticide regulation at an EU level has also begun to discourage the activity of the European Biotechnology industry who develops pesticides for agricultural use within the EU. The average time frame in which it takes companies to develop new pesticides has increased to an average of 11.4 years and the rate of new actives reaching the market has decreased from 4 in 1995 to 1.4 in 2014.::This is largely due to the high cost of development and testing which now requires over €215 million euro to get an active ingredient to market, representing an increase of 11.7% from 2005 costs alone. At the end of 2021 there was 215 active substances listed for the renewal process in the EU yet only 158 applications had been submitted, signifying that at least 60 of the 476 approved substances in the EU would not be renewed.::By the end of 2018 there was also a list of 100 potentially new active substances that were required to be tested under the regulatory framework that remained shelved due to the incoherency in the substitution system.::This irregularity in policy not only results in actives being retracted with no substitution, but exemplifies the grievances plant protection companies and farmers have with the Commissions regulatory process which has downstream effects for farmers wishing to protect their yields and income.::It also identifies a clear weakness in the Commission's proposals for new biological plant protection products to replace current chemistry as the regulatory framework is inhibitory to their ability to reach markets for farmers.::Irish crop production operates in a high disease pressure environment and if farmers are to access emerging human value chains for crops, they require plant protection products to ensure they are not hindered by Minimum residue levels for mycotoxins which are becoming increasingly stringent.::It is strategically important to communicate this food safety requirement when developing potential pesticide control policies. Minimisation of the number of actives farmers can access is also a poor anti-resistance and integrated pest management strategy.",

    "Intended Results":"To highlight concerns about the level of fodder produced year to date at a national level ahead of this winter.::To propose that, due to the introduction of the fertiliser register and the mixed messages communicated by the Department of Agriculture relating to 2024 inorganic nitrogen (N) allowances, farmers are in the dark on how much fertiliser they can spread for the remainder of 2024.::Livestock farmers should be provided with inorganic N statements similar to organic N statements currently provided with immediate effect. This would allow farmers to establish how much additional fertiliser they can apply for the remainder of the growing season and encourage many to apply inorganic N in a safe manner that maximises forage production on their farms.::To highlight that it is imperative we maximise the production of fodder via catch crops this Autumn\/Winter. IFA propose per provisions within Commission agreed CAP Simplification Package, provide a temporary derogation (in full) from GAEC-6 conditionality requirements, specifically the 30% lie-back requirement on growing of catch crops.::To propose the introduction of a scheme similar to the 2018 Fodder Incentive Measure which incentivised tillage farmers to plant catch crops and short duration temporary grass species. This measure will require changes to GAEC 6 as outlined above in order to have a material impact.::To highlight that currently, farmers who opt for the catch crops option under ACRES can only graze these crops after January 1st. Consideration should be given to facilitating an earlier grazing date thereby giving farmers increased flexibility to maximise utilisation of these crops.::To highlight that the whole-cropping of silage from late sown barley and oat crops offers another opportunity to generate additional fodder. This option needs to be promoted widely to farmers. There should also be engagement with appropriate stakeholders (e.g. co-operatives) who could facilitate agreements between tillage and livestock farmers for these crops.::To propose that further support is required to facilitate the transport of fodder from surplus to deficit areas. Accordingly, IFA is seeking the re-introduction of the Fodder Transport Subsidy Scheme launched in Spring 2024 with consideration given to extending the support to all forage types.::To highlight that cashflow is particularly tight on farms currently owing to high input costs and falling output prices. It is imperative that financial institutions provide maximum flexibility to farmers in terms of provision of low-cost working capital as well as restructuring existing short-term borrowings where required. Direct engagement with banks and other financial providers should take place immediately to ensure farmers are properly supported financially.::To seek a meeting with the Minister for Agriculture, Food, and the Marine to discuss IFA proposals.",

    "Subject Matter":"Pig Housing under the Targeted Agricultural Modernisation Scheme (TAMS).",
    "Intended Results":"To express Irish pig farmers deep disappointment with the unacceptable lack of progress on the specifications for pig housing under the Targeted Agricultural Modernisation Scheme (TAMS). This matter has dragged on far too long, leaving farmers in a very difficult position as they anxiously wait to implement actionable changes that are both necessary and expected.::To highlight that many farmers out of sheer frustration and necessity are now proceeding to upgrade their housing facilities without using TAMS funding. This is a failure of the department to Irish pig farmers. Since the publication of the revised specifications in April 2022, which were deemed totally unworkable by the industry, no farmer has availed of this funding outside of the typical items. This is a glaring anomaly that underscores the urgent need for an updated and practical scheme.::To call again on the Department of Agriculture, Food, and the Marine for immediate action on this front. To ask, yet again, that they engage directly with the Teagasc Pig Development Department at all stages to ensure that the revised scheme is one which farmers can implement practically with workable specifications. Such a scheme must improve conditions on commercial pig farms and secondly ensure that Irish pig producers can remain competitive on a global marketplace.::To emphasise that specifications that exceed those adopted by our competing Member States are simply not viable or acceptable. This critical issue was emphasised at many meetings over the past 2 years and yet again during the recent Pig Food Vision meeting. At the meeting it was agreed that Teagasc should be in regular contact with the Department and go over the proposed specifications so that they could address any issues that may arise from the revised draft prior to its publication.::To highlight that the 2025 DG Sante audit looms and it is imperative that tangible progress is shown by presenting a TAMS scheme that farmers will embrace. Focusing solely on the level of participation in the intact tails audit is not good enough. Pig producers now need and want to update their facilities. The department are depriving them of the opportunity to utilise TAMS funds because workable specifications are still not available.::The TAMS specifications and available funds are an integral necessity which should be readily available for farmers to engage with and utilise. The lack of any progress at farm level is significantly the responsibility of the department, whose unworkable specifications and inaction, must bear most of the blame.::To urge the Department of Agriculture, Food, and the Marine to prioritise this matter, and provide an update without further delay.",

    "Intended Results":"To propose a better Agri-environment scheme for Irish farmers.::Engagement with farmers::- Much improved lines of communications & engagement between key stakeholders (e.g. DAFM, ACRES CP Teams, planners) & farmers is required. There is too much ambiguity and responsibility deflection ongoing currently, with farmers left frustrated, uncertain where they stand, and out of pocket because of lack of accountability elsew::- Provide clarification and transparency on remaining rolling budgets to participants on elements including resultsbased scorecard payments, NPIs, LAs and the Landscape Bonus.::- Greater detail and clarity is required with regard the Landscape (High Achievement) Bonus Payment. While we understand it will reward farmers for high average scores across their private land within CP zones, or where they have a large area of land within the CP zone, and it will be backdated\/applied to the full period of participation in the ACRES Scheme – how will it be administered; funded; and what impact (if any) will it have on maximum permitted ACRES payments received .::- DAFM need to proactively notify farmers (& planners) of potential penalties\/anomalies arising from non-action. By way of example, where scorecards are not submitted in full by the planner. Flexibilities should be provided where it is evident that the farmer is invested in the scheme, yet planner has not fully executed – for example in instances where at least one parcel scorecard has been submitted successfully, yet others remain in ‘Draft' format.::- On low scoring commonages, DAFM should engage directly with those actively cutting turbary and higher stocked farmers (whether ACRES participant or otherwise) to outline the impact of their actions and encourage altered practices and\/or grazing management techniques.::Administration::- Adequate resources should be deployed to DAFM staffing; I.T infrastructure etc to ensure the swift delivery of payments per the Farmers Charter of Rights. Individual cases (incl. partnerships), which require additional processing, should not be continually pushed out or without payment, as occurred for over 200 farmers within ACRES. Advance payments should issue to all, with any issue\/discrepancy corrected via balancing and\/or future scheme payments where required.::- Alleviate the burden of proof\/verification required to receive payments by relying more on self-declaration and\/or other mechanisms (e.g. Geo-tagged photos; AMS; AIMS, etc). For the second round of scoring, score a sample of parcels rather than all relevant parcels, incorporating therein the largest; lowest and highest scored parcels.::- The cost incurred \/ income foregone methodology has negated the economic benefit of scheme participation, amplified by delayed NPI\/LA approvals; large planner fees for preparation of plans & annual charges. Farmers that implement environmental actions on farm (e.g low scoring commonage areas) should be the main beneficiaries, and better rewarded for their efforts::Given delayed NPI\/LA approvals, through no fault of the farmer, it is unlikely the full environmental benefit of actions taken (& consequently financial return through improved parcel scoring) will be reflected within the remaining ACRES period. Consequently, increased payment rates should be offered and\/or a return to a ‘whole of farm' approach as per previous agri-environmental schemes implemented::- Given their high nature value credentials (and fewer applicable measures noted within ACRES) a standalone payment, or increased payment rates, should be provided for NPWS designated sites (SACs, SPAs, NHAs, pNHAs::- A transitionary period should apply before the impact of scoring takes effect. This should apply also where key scheme components are required, yet are not yet fully functional. In both scenarios, full potential annual payments should be paid to all applicants.::By way of example - given the late circulation of parcel scoring and non-availability of Non-Productive Investments (NPI)\/ Landscape Actions (LA), a full €7,000 \/ €10,500 payment should be paid to all ACRES applicants for years 1 & 2 ((retrospectively if required), with the impact of scoring, where relevant, to apply only from Year 3 onwards,::where after the farmer has been given ample time and opportunity to correct any anomalies and apply \/ implement environmental measures through NPI \/ LAs to support \/ improve parcel scoring.::This satisfies the results-based approach, and delivers a fair payment to farmers. Increasing possible thresholds for mechanisms not yet available is unreasonable and unacceptable. It places additional pressure on farmers too - incurring larger cash outlays and larger investments\/action to recoup fully what was suggested initially through ACRES when approved for the scheme::- Full scheme details must be provided to farmers at the outset. The DAFM \/ ACRES CP Team agreed protocol of 100m buffer around active turbary should be removed entirely where peat is harvested for personal household use, and on legally held and registered turbary plots assigned by the State. It is excessive, most especially for smaller commonage areas, as currently stands. Under REPS, AEOS, and GLAS, the nett area of the plot harvested was all that was deducted from payment.::- Allow for batch approvals processes (NPI \/ LA) pre closing deadline to reduce wait times between planning and implementation and to ease also advisor workload::- Unless to the farmer's advantage, individual terms\/ qualifications must hold for at least the term of the new CAP programme. There can be no downward revision or pro-rata reduction in either payment or maximum eligible area within individual measures.::- An opt out option without penalty should apply where what was sold & signed up to has not been delivered.::- New entrants post 2022 interested in an agri-environmental scheme must be accommodated. Farmers cannot be left without an agri-environmental scheme for the remaining term of the existing CAP programme.::Scoring::- A review of the scoring \/ payment system should apply. The DAFM need to acknowledge that past agri-environmental scheme criteria may have impacted current scoring (e.g. minimum stocking rates), and whether relating to late scoring submissions; minimal invasive species; turbary activity and\/or dumping, ACRES applicants should not be penalised for the actions \/ non-actions of third parties.::Force majeure, proportionality, and fairness should apply. Similar to BISS, there should also be a period from which parcel scores \/ plans could be amended without penalty.::- Farmers should be advised the date that their lands are being scored, and provided with the opportunity, should they so wish, to accompany the planner\/consultant during the scoring exercise to enable information sharing and corrective action to be relayed in a timelier fashion than having to wait a significant period as occurred with ACRES. More broadly, an agreed timeline is required for the provision of parcel scoring to farmers post completion.::- The probability of achieving a high score should at least be equal to the probability of achieving a lower score. No negative marking should apply, with a ‘0' the lowest score applied. Currently, within individual ACRES scorecards, most carry far higher cumulative negative scoring. This should be corrected and a re-weighting of scores & associated payments assigned where required.::- In light of Year 1 scores achieved nationally, review and consider the appropriateness or otherwise of the €145\/ha rate utilised for ALL owned\/rented\/leased commonage parcels in ringfencing calculations.::Where material discrepancies arise, and additional non-commonage lands were held but excluded, a retrospective payment, equivalent to the differential between the parcel rate derived and €300\/ha (i.e. the rate assigned for all owned forage CP parcels declared as Permanent Pasture, Low Input Permanent Pasture or Traditional Hay Meadow) should be made to impacted farmers for each additional non-commonage hectare excluded from the scheme, subject to €7,000 overall core payment.::Any additional residual amounts should be allocated to Non-Productive Investment allocations as per existing arrangements.::- Applicants with parcels scoring below payment levels (i.e. <4) should be automatically entitled to a participation payment and have such parcels rescored in the subsequent year (not all lands) should they so wish, and prioritized, so as to not impinge core payments received in immediate subsequent years.::- Applicants with parcels scoring below payment levels (i.e. <4) should be automatically entitled to a participation payment and have such parcels rescored in the subsequent year (not all lands) should they so wish, and prioritized, so as to not impinge core payments received in immediate subsequent years.::- A streamlined appeals mechanism to be put in place where repayment requests from the Department can be adjudicated on in a timely and efficient manner. A similar efficient commonage scoring appeals system is required.::- Any recoupment of funds should be done only on agreement and span multiple years where necessary. No interest charge\/penalty on such funds should apply.::General Actions::- A wide selection of on-farm actions should be provided for participants to select the most suited for their individual operation. The Riparian Buffer Zone & Grass Margin measure should be included as an option for ACRES Co-operation as it is currently for ACRES General applicants.::- As budgets (and budgets predications allow), raise the maximum core payment from €7,000 to €10,000. This would incentivise additional ecosystem services and should not require a new IT system re-build to implement.::- Where 2 or more actions are implemented in parallel on individual parcels\/locations (e.g. new hedge alongside riparian buffer margin), one fence should satisfy.::- Greater flexibility around individual measure completion deadlines (at least to Year 4), most particularly where adverse weather conditions and\/or input supply constraints are clearly evident in the weeks leading up to completion deadlines. Planting requirements should span the lifetime of the scheme to allow national suppliers build necessary native stocks instead importing plants and exposing native species to a greater risk of disease.::Non-Productive Investments \/ Landscape Actions::- Existing Non-Productive Investments \/ Landscape Actions should be available to all farmers whose land is scored, regardless of being in CP or General. The purpose of NPI's is to improve scores, however farmers in ACRES General with LIG or Commonage have no direct support, financial support nor means of applying for NPI's to improve these field scores. This must be corrected.::- New\/additional bespoke measures should also be eligible for payment where more appropriate to promote\/enhance habitat\/biodiversity in individual locations and agreed in consultation with CP Teams.::- It is essential that farmers are provided with a schedule of NPI & LA application windows (i.e. opening & closing dates), but more importantly an agreed decision timeline is derived (& enforced) from when, post the end of the application window, farmers can expect to receive approval letters. Non-receipt of formal decisions within agreed timelines are assumed approved.::It is unacceptable, as has happened to date, that applications for NPI which closed early December 2023, yet mid-November 2024 no farmer has been able to undertake the necessary environmental action because the issuing of approval letters has not yet commenced::- A centralised fund per ACRES CP Team should be established, with greater authority afforded to ACRES CP Teams to approve NPI \/ LA, at least for certain investment types, to support a more streamlined NPI \/ LA process::- Similar to mobile TAMS applications (subject perhaps to max. €5,000 ceiling per application), permit applicants to progress with NPI\/LA, at their own risk, once valid applications have been submitted. Payments to follow on receipt of geo-tagged photo and vouched expenses. This too will enable actions to be undertaken quicker, and more time for actions to yield greater environmental benefit and improved scoring\/payments overall.::- To minimise lost time, afforded resources and constrained environmental action, opportunity to amend minor infringements within individual applications should be permitted, rather than reject individual measures entirely. For example, moving a water trough outside the required 20m perimeter of a watercourse, where currently its location is within the excluded area. Approval on condition is provided for within the NPI specifications::- Culverts are included within eligible NPI's to provide a safe drain crossing point for livestock, people, and vehicles to cross drains without fording them and prevent regular discharges of sediment and nutrients to watercourses. However, culverts are not permitted on natural watercourses (incl. OSI waterline and Single Stream line) or on arterial drainage channels. This will considerably limit the potential benefit of this NPI and should be reviewed::- Consideration should be given to supporting complementary investments to those listed (e.g. gate pillars where required), and ensuring individual NPI eligibility criterion do not prohibit individual livestock type (e.g. min 317 litre water trough and its suitability for sheep operations).::- Clarification is needed on whether there will be opportunity provided to seek an extension to NPI completions to the following year, and submit a payment as a single application then. By way of context, it may be more practical and cost-effective for farmers, who applied for NPI's in 2023 and 2024, to combine \/ action categories of investments rather than proceed in sequence of NPI application.::- To aid resource efficiency, consideration should be given to utilising excess interim payments, in full\/part, as advance payment for the completion of approved Non-Productive Investments where applicable.::Penalties::- Penalties applied to non-compliance must be proportionate and fair. A complete disregard of positive environmental action undertaken and the application of a full 100% penalty on total yearly payments is excessive (plus potentially complete removal of individual actions for payment in subsequent years), most particularly where only minor infringements occur, with perhaps no direct correlation on the overall environmental outcomes achieved (e.g. failing to pay membership to a breed society).::- Aligned with above, the methodology \/ correlation between penalty severity and the Tiered Structure should be reviewed and reduced, most particularly given 100% approval was provided to all ACRES applicants and rank\/selection made redundant. By way of example, many farmers selected ‘priority Tier 1 actions' to increase their probability of acceptance into ACRES.::It is disproportionate that a participant would get no opportunity to correct and secure payment for an individual Tier 1 in future years of the scheme (as provided for re Tier 2 actions).::- Where, during scoring activities, there appears evidence of invasive species on Commonage from Coillte\/Stateowned lands (e.g. Sitka Spruce\/Pine saplings from adjacent Coillte land), it's specific location should be noted by the planner\/consultant and the penalty imposed passed on to Coillte and\/or the State where applicable for payment::- Inspections should follow the Farmers Charter of Rights protocol, with all farmers, irrespective of whether inspected or not, provided with a detailed list of annual requirements for scheme participation.::In addition, at least 48hrs hours advance notice should be provided (incl to planner), with a written summary of the inspection provided to the farmer before leaving the farm. A streamlined appeals mechanism should also be put in place, with details provided to the farmer and adjudicated on n in a timely and efficient manner.",
