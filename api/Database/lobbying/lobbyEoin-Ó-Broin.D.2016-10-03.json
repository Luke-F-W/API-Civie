Having not received a response from SDCC planning department, SVRA then emailed Cllr. O'Broin with the same query (05\/07\/22). Cllr. O'Broin spoke to Feasible and suggested a workshop with SVRA and residents to discuss the plans. Cllr OBroin gave information as to the process for rezoning - a material contravention of the development plan.

The meeting was attended by 3 councillors (Cllr OBroin, Cllr OHara, Cllr Carey).
