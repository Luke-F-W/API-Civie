    "Intended Results":"This is why we are collectively calling on the Government to convene a Citizens’ Assembly on drugs so that the Irish people have an opportunity to consider drug policy reform. We are calling on the Department of the Taoiseach to take responsibility for its delivery. The Assembly would allow participants to examine the international, European, national, and local research on drug use and drug policy.::he Assembly would present an opportunity to consider the perspectives of representative groups, advocacy groups, experts, and drug policy makers. It would also, importantly, allow the Irish people to consider the many contributing factors to drug use and addiction. We are calling for an Assembly which will consider drug use, policy, and reform broadly. It’s essential that the Assembly is nottoo limited in scope orrestricted to a healthcare framework",

In order to maintain the viability of this sensitive sector, which suffered an increase in total costs of 28% in 2022 (Ireland), the EU market cannot be further eroded by the addition of increased quota to Australian exports to the EU despite what Australian negotiators may request or expect.::That the average Irish suckler beef herd is 17 cows and this must be protected. Consumption of beef is falling in the EU (estimated by GIRA at -4.8% 2022-2027). This is not the time to grant increased quota to Australian imports whose high value beef products will undermine the EU producers' ability to achieve a profitable return.::Food inflationary pressures have affected affordability of beef in the EU market and the livestock sector will suffer further contraction if it is not supported and protected.::To highlight that EU farmers face two wars on the periphery of the EU market and increased commitments in the transition process of the Green Deal. The cumulative effect of EU trade deals adds to the impact Irish and EU farmers face following the UK bilateral trade deals attracting additional product of beef and sheep meat onto the EU market.::The price of Irish beef has fallen €1\/kg below the UK price, as a result of lower beef purchases in the UK following the increased access to cheaper high value cuts from such trade deals, in particular, Australia.::To point out that Ireland seeks to provide a viable future for young farmers, however, their future is threatened by trade deals that can threaten the economic sustainability of Irish farms.
