The Ready to Build Scheme, funded by the Croí Cónaithe Towns Fund, to support addressing vacancy, was launched in September 2022.  Under the scheme, local authorities identify suitable vacant sites in their ownership or purchase vacant sites in towns and villages and make them available for sale to individual purchasers for the purpose of building a principal private residence. Once serviced, the local authority will make the site available for sale at a discount on the market value of the site. The level of discount to the individual will depend on the level of servicing cost incurred by the local authority before the sale of the site, up to a maximum of €30,000.  Local authorities can be supported to make vacant sites available in towns and villages throughout the country with sufficient provision of services and amenities.  The scheme is managed and administered by local authorities on behalf of my Department. To date 32 sites have been made available for sale by 4 local authorities, 5 sites in Wicklow, 16 sites in Laois, 4 sites in Tipperary and 7 sites by Kildare County Council.

While the Authority exercises its functions independently, it is fully accountable to my Department for its performance, governance and use of public funds. This is established through both legislation and the Code of Practice for the Governance of State Bodies , which is implemented through a number of formal oversight mechanisms.  Firstly, under the Code of Practice, an Oversight Agreement (OA) and a Performance Delivery Agreement (PDA) are in place between my Department and the NTA. These agreements clearly define:  • the statutory and policy framework within which the NTA must operate;  • the respective roles and responsibilities of the Authority and the Department;  • key outputs, performance indicators and reporting requirements; and  • the governance, compliance and assurance obligations placed on the NTA.  Secondly, the Department exercises ongoing oversight through a structured programme of engagement, including:  • monthly meetings between NTA senior management and senior Department officials to review operational issues and emerging risks;  • quarterly corporate governance meetings which examine compliance, performance against the PDA, financial management, and risk management;  • regular day-to-day engagement at working level on policy, project delivery, legislation, and programme implementation; and  • direct engagement with me as Minister, as required, on strategic or topical matters.  Additionally, the NTA is also required to submit annual reports, strategy statements, financial accounts, and other documentation that enable the Department to assess its performance.

Local authorities negotiate Part V agreements with the developer in line with a range of guidelines and supports aimed at assisting them in maximising the benefits of Part V in the context of its housing needs. Local authorities have a range of options available when negotiating with developers including the transfer of land, the building and transfer of houses or the transfer of houses off-site.  Subject to the legislative provisions, local authorities are free to decide how the 20% Part V contribution is broken down in terms of social and affordable housing (with a minimum 10% social housing) and by dwelling type. This is done in line with the local authorities housing need as identified in its Housing Strategy made as part of its Development Plan. Part V arrangements are a matter for the relevant local authority operating within the Guidelines.

Government is committed to increasing housing available to older people to facilitate ageing in place with dignity and independence and to supporting rightsizing on a voluntary basis. The Government’s new housing plan, Delivering Homes, Building Communities 2025-2030, includes measures which will increase delivery of housing for older people through increased delivery of social housing, increased delivery of more suitable homes in private housing and increased choice to support voluntary rightsizing.  The new Housing Plan will increase delivery of more suitable homes and choice for older people in private housing including through a review of the planning exemptions for those who wish to convert their homes into separate living spaces. The new Housing Plan will increase choice for older people to voluntarily rightsize through advancing consideration of the availability of bridging finance to support rightsizing, a review of the operation of existing local authority financial contribution schemes and supporting social housing tenants who wish to rightsize to more suitable accommodation.  My Department is advancing these measures now incorporated in the new housing plan, Delivering Homes, Building Communities 2025-2030. ",

Tenancy sustainment, or tenant-in-situ, is a priority category under my Department's Second Hand Acquisitions Programme. It is not a scheme, but a policy tool available to local authorities to prevent social housing supported households in the private rented sector from falling into homelessness. It should only be used as a last resort by local authorities when all other options have been exhausted.  More broadly, the Second Hand Acquisitions Programme currently provides funding to local authorities to support acquisitions under four priority categories, including:  • exits from homelessness,  • urgent responses for priority cohorts such as persons with disabilities, older persons, care leavers, &c.,  • tenancy sustainment (tenant in situ), and  • buy and renew tackling vacancy and dereliction.  I expect the local authority allocations for 2026, and funding allocated to the targeted priorities, to be notified to local authorities early next year.  In the meantime, local authorities can enter into commitments for 2026 to a value of up to 30% of their original 2025 acquisitions budget. This allows them commit, pending an agreed programme budget for next year, some €95 million extra in 2025 for acquisitions that will complete and draw down in 2026. This flexibility effectively provides for a multi-annual approach to programme delivery, facilitating local authorities to plan and progress acquisitions from one year to the next with a higher level of certainty vis-à-vis future funding availability.

This individual was initially issued a multi-site General Employment Permit, which permitted employment across HSE-affiliated hospitals. Upon their transfer to the hospital referenced in February 2024, a new General Employment Permit was submitted and subsequently awarded. This hospital, as a Section 38 facility, does not meet the criteria for a multi-site permit, and therefore the application submitted was valid and processed correctly in accordance with the provisions of the Employment Permits system.  While the change in permit type may have impacted their Stamp 4 application, the Department understands that the Department of Justice will take into account the period of employment under the original multi-site permit when assessing the eligibility for long-term residency.  The applicant may wish to explore the option of applying for a Critical Skills Employment Permit, which would allow them to apply for Stamp 4 after two years of employment.  The Employment Permits system plays a vital role in supporting Ireland’s health service by facilitating the recruitment of qualified medical professionals from outside the EEA. The Department recognises the essential contribution of doctors working in the public healthcare system and aims to ensure that the permit process is responsive to sectoral needs. The Department continues to work closely with the HSE and other stakeholders to ensure that eligible applicants are supported appropriately and that administrative processes reflect the realities of clinical placements and hospital transfers.

        "answerText": " Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage  Approved Housing Bodies (AHBs) are making an important contribution to social housing delivery, as envisaged under current Government policy. My Department operates a number of funding programmes that assist local authorities to work in partnership with AHBs to construct, purchase and lease new homes and make them available for social housing. One such programme that AHBs progress construction projects through is the Capital Advance Loan Facility (CALF).  CALF funding is capital support provided to Approved Housing Bodies (AHBs) by local authorities to facilitate the funding of construction or acquisition of new social housing units. This loan facility can support between 25% and 30% of the eligible capital cost of the housing project, with the remaining finance sourced by the AHBs from private lenders (usually the Housing Finance Agency (HFA)).  The housing units are provided to local authorities for social housing use under long-term lease arrangements known as Payment and Availability Agreements (P&A). A nominal interest rate of 2% fixed per annum is charged by the local authority on the initial capital amount. Repayments on either the capital or interest are not required during the term of the loan (between 10 and 30 years), although where an AHB chooses to, repayments can be made during the term. At the end of the term, the outstanding capital amount plus the interest accrued, is owed and repayable to the local authority. The local authority issues the CALF monies to the AHB and the local authority, in turn, recoups same from the Department.  The P&A and CALF financial assessment is currently carried out by the Housing Agency on behalf of my Department. This assessment involves analysing the eligible capital costs, projected income and projected expenditure against a standard set of agreed assumptions which have been published and are available to the sector. As part of the financial assessment, the Housing Agency examines the overall capital cost indicated in the application and, where appropriate, costs that are ineligible for inclusion in the assessment are deducted. Any such deductions are explained to the AHB. The purpose of the assessment is only to determine the appropriate level of funding that my Department is willing to provide, in line with the parameters of the scheme and it is not intended as a viability assessment of a project. Viability assessment of any proposed project is a matter for each AHB.  As with all Exchequer-supported projects, my Department as sanctioning authority, assesses each project proposal for suitability as determined by the Local Authority, value for money and compliance with the various requirements of the funding programme before approval is issued.  With the allocation of additional monies the Government approved in July 2025, the total combined budget for CALF in 2025 stands at €710 million, which is the highest annual allocation since the Funding Scheme commenced. This is a significant increase from 2024 budget of €440 million, highlighting the strong support provided to the AHB sector by the Government.  The application process for AHB developments under the Cost Rental Equity Loan (CREL) scheme is managed by the Housing Agency. The funding made available to CREL projects is a function of modelling the costs of constructing or acquiring, financing, managing, and maintaining the cost rentals homes subject to the terms and condition of the Scheme.  Under my Department’s Capital Assistance Scheme (CAS), funding of 100% is available to Approved Housing Bodies (AHBs) for the capital development costs for new social homes for priority category needs tenants and while each project is considered on its own merits there is no practice of applying cost deductions to CAS approvals in the form of disallowing major portions of land i.e. land utilised for housing by the AHB is fully funded by my Department. With regard to construction, costs are approved in line with accepted tenders. Financing costs are, in the main, not an issue for AHBs advancing projects under this delivery programme on the basis of 100% capital funding being provided. Communal Facilities Grant scheme funding to compliment a CAS project is allowed at 95% of the costs of the works or €7,500 per unit of accommodation whichever is the lesser. ",

I am focussed on building on the strong progress made over recent years to tackle local authority vacancy levels. This progress has been enabled by significant funding from my Department over the last 10 years, with over €360m recouped to local authorities under the voids programme since 2014 and supporting the refurbishment and re-let of 25,672 dwellings.  Given the significant scale of investment over the decade, all legacy vacancy issues should have been dealt with local authorities at this stage. Accordingly, local authorities should be in a strong position regarding long-term vacancy and, with the ongoing support of my Department, being able to further transition to a strategic and planned stock management and maintenance approach.  With this in mind, I intend the new voids programme will renew the emphasis on prompt turnaround and re-letting of vacant units by focusing only on those works necessary to comply with the Housing (Standards for Rented Houses) Regulations 2019. Non-essential works should be carried out under each local authority’s planned maintenance programme informed by stock condition surveys, whereby all housing components are on an inspection, repair and replacement cycle.  While the management and maintenance of local authority housing stock is a matter for each local authority under s.58 of the Housing Act 1966, the approach being developed is necessary to ensure a strategic approach to managing and maintaining housing stock, informed by stock condition surveys, is in place, and vacancies are turned around quickly.  My Department has been working with local authorities and Approved Housing Bodies to identify opportunities to reduce the time it takes to allocate and tenant a social home. It is critical the allocation systems and procedures utilised by local authorities and AHBs operate to ensure there is no avoidable delay in households in need of accommodation being provided with these homes. The Local Government Sector published a code of practice for AHB nominations in 2022, which sought to standardise the end-to-end allocation process and eliminate avoidable delays that could result in a property remaining vacant. My Department is establishing a working group to review this code to ensure it is being consistently implemented across AHBs and local authorities. ",

I am advised that Deputy Hearne's question relates to the Living City Initiative (LCI) rather that the 'over the shop' premises relief.  The LCI is a targeted measure which is aimed at very specific areas in urgent need of regeneration, it is provided for under sections 372AAA to 372AAD of the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997. It currently offers income or corporation tax relief for qualifying expenditure incurred in the refurbishment and conversion of qualifying residential and commercial buildings located within ‘Special Regeneration Areas' (SRAs) of the cities of Cork, Dublin, Galway, Kilkenny, Limerick and Waterford.  I am advised by Revenue that it is not possible to identify from the Income Tax and Corporation Tax tax returns the number of properties made available to the housing market through the LCI as requested by the Deputies (by county, city or otherwise).  I am further advised by Revenue that information in relation to the LCI can be found in the cost of tax expenditure report on the Revenue website at:  https://www.revenue.ie/en/corporate/documents/statistics/tax-expenditures/costs-tax-expenditures.pdf  Details of this information are set out below:      Year      No. of Claims      Cost of Relief (€m)       2022    89    1.1      2021    65    0.5      2020    59    0.4      2019    60    0.5      2018    29    0.2      2017    23    0.2      2016    15    0.2      2015    13    0.2      2014    <10    0.1      2013    <10    0      2012    <10    0      2011    <10    0      Total    c. 400    3.4     In relation to evaluations of the LCI by my Department, the following sets out the position.

My Department reviewed the scheme in 2016 in consultation with the relevant Local Authorities and the Department of Arts, Heritage, Regional, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs.  The LCI was also reviewed by my Department as part of the Tax Strategy Group processes in 2022 and 2023.  Finally, any evaluations carried out by Local Authorities, are matters appropriate to the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage, and are not directly within the responsibility of the Minister for Finance.

The Act also imposes a duty on local authorities to take all reasonable steps, including the exercise of appropriate statutory powers, to ensure that any land within their functional area does not become, or continue to be, a derelict site.  Each local authority maintains a Derelict Sites Register under section 8 of the Act for sites which they consider are derelict under the Act. Sites entered on the Derelict Sites Register are subject to an annual derelict sites levy of 7% of market value which will continue to apply until the site is rendered non-derelict.  All local authorities are required to submit an annual return to my Department providing information on the operation of the Derelict Sites Act 1990 in their functional areas.

      "question": {
        "answerText": " Deputy James Browne  I thank the Deputy for his question.  I confirm that there are no approval lags for CREL funding. There is an approval process for funding applications to ensure compliance with the scheme conditions and value for money for the Exchequer. This is, as it should be, a requirement under public financial procedures. A necessary process should not be misrepresented as a delay.  Since July last year, the average time taken from the date the final report was submitted to the Department to the date of approval is 48 working days. In this regard, my Department has already approved more than 41 affordable housing body, AHB, projects this year, which will deliver more than 3,000 units up to 2029, while more than €400 million in CREL funding has been provided to AHBs to date in 2025. This ongoing and continued resourcing underpins the Government's commitment to the sector and I am satisfied that the approval process and support for AHBs under CREL is robust.  While my Department makes every effort to process CREL and CALF applications as quickly as possible, the size, scale, complexity and specifications of each application is significant and the assessment time required to ensure projects are viable and represent value for money can vary. In addition, where an application is for funding under both CREL and CALF, it is often the case that the applications for the two schemes are not submitted by AHBs at the same time. In such instances, clarification is sought from the relevant AHB to establish whether a project can proceed independently. Where individual progress is impossible, turnaround times can be affected. My Department encourages AHBs and local authorities to seek funding for such projects simultaneously and will take further steps, as required, to ensure this happens going forward. \n Deputy Rory Hearne  We need to be honest here about what is going on. Someone is spinning something or telling porkies. It was reported on RTÉ's \"Prime Time\" last May that there were delays. AHBs said there were delays. It cannot be easy for approved housing bodies to be publicly critical of the Department of housing and the delays in because they rely on the Department for their funding. They said it very clearly in the public domain - as well as to me and others - that there is huge uncertainty in relation to the approval of these cost rental affordable projects and the social housing associated with it. The Minister and the Department might be putting it across that these are questions relating to the different points at which projects are approved, but we need to get straighter.  How many projects have been turned down for CREL and CALF? \n Deputy James Browne  I reject the premise that there have been delays. For example, 54 CREL projects have been approved since the beginning of July last year and the average number of working days was 48 for this period. The processing times for individual applications can vary for the reasons I have outlined. That said, the trend is that projects are taking less and less time to assess. For example, projects submitted from July to December 2024 took 93 working days on average, whereas projects submitted from January to July 2025 - in my time - took 15 days on average. However, it is important to note that the standard deviation is high. Each project is assessed on an individual basis so the time it takes to assess one project does not in any indicate the time taken for another project. The longest time an application was on hand with the Department before receiving approval was 200 working days, while the shortest was a single working day. That can come down to a number of different reasons. We process these as quickly as possible but it can come down to the nature of the application. We have to do value for money, look at the specifications and, at times, seek further information in relation to various applications. \n Deputy Rory Hearne  We are in agreement that we want to see as many cost rental and social homes as possible built in as quick a time as possible. I do not understand why it is coming out that there are these delays. The Minister says there are no delays. I am not satisfied that is the case because AHBs are saying there are issues of delays. The Minister also said at the housing committee that there is a finite amount of funding - which of course there is - to approve these projects. However, that has to mean that there are projects going forward that are coming to the Department's desk and it is having to decide that it will not fund them. I would like to know, and we should know, how many proposals are coming forward from AHBs for social housing that the Department is deciding not to progress because the funding is not there. \n Deputy James Browne  We are not in that situation at the moment. As I said, we are processing these ever more quickly. As I said, it took 15 days, on average, in the first six months of this year to process these applications. I encourage applications. There is an issue there, as the Deputy rightly pointed out, in terms of CALF and CREL not being aligned. It is something that the Department with AHBs and local authorities have to work on to see how we can get them better aligned. I admit that it is a frustration for me when I sign off on a cost-rental and then I see we have to wait to get the CALF because it is on a different track. That is because the applications are coming in differently. It is something that I, with the Department, AHBs and local authorities, can get an awful lot better. I am going to work on doing that. ",

        "answerText": " Deputy Rory Hearne  Will the Minister update us on the plans to deliver the social housing projects via public-private partnerships? I understand that there are legal issues in relation to those. Is there any progress on that, particularly around the projects in Ballymun and Whitehall in my own constituency and elsewhere in Dublin? What is the status of those social housing projects? When will they be delivered? The Minister might update us on those. What are the future plans for public-private partnerships? \n Deputy James Browne  I thank the Deputy. The question I have in front of me from the Deputy relates to a housing referendum. \n Deputy Rory Hearne  There may have been a different notification in relation to the question. Apologies. I will ask that question briefly. \n Deputy James Browne  I am happy to get the Deputy a written answer on the other question but----- \n Deputy Rory Hearne  Perfect. \n Deputy James Browne  I will answer the question on the housing referendum now.  The Housing Commission was established in December 2021 to consider housing policy post 2030 and make proposals building on Housing for All. It was also tasked with advising the Government on the critical factors to be considered regarding a referendum on housing and, if appropriate, to recommend wording for a constitutional change. The commission submitted its report to the Government, including recommendations pertaining to a referendum on housing, in May of last year. There were differing views within the commission on the right to housing and no consensus on what was a complex issue.  At the moment, the Government is fully focused on measures to tackle homelessness, increase housing supply and affordability and ensure access to housing of an adequate standard for all. As work continues on our new housing plan, we are continuing to focus on measures in the short, medium and long terms to boost supply. In the past few months alone, I have secured record levels of funding for social and affordable housing. Furthermore, the establishment of a new housing infrastructure fund in my Department will help to secure the enabling infrastructure needed for public and private housing developments and unblock infrastructure delays on the ground. This practical focus on housing supply is my priority right now but I will keep the report to the commission on this area under review. \n Deputy Rory Hearne  There was a very clear commitment in the 2020 Fianna Fáil manifesto in relation to holding a referendum on housing. I cannot remember whether it was in Fine Gael’s manifesto as well, but I think there was a commitment around it in the 2020 programme for Government. There was also a Seanad motion passed calling for a referendum on the right to housing and a constitutional change that would insert a very clear right to housing. That was proposed by a Fianna Fáil Senator and backed by Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael Senators. What has changed? Why has this new Government run away from the right to housing? The Minister's response was not accurate as regards the Housing Commission. The majority recommendation from the commission was to insert a right to housing in the Constitution.  There was opposition but that was a minority. The majority of the Housing Commission recommended the insertion of a right to housing in the Constitution, so why is the Government not progressing that? \n Deputy James Browne  The Deputy is right that there were differing views on the commission, and well-reasoned views I think on both sides among the commission members as set out in the various reports. While it was a majority it is not that straightforward either due to the different views. We are keeping this under review but my priority is actually delivering on housing. It is a basic necessity, one of the most fundamental basic necessities, for people to have a home and to have a roof over their head. We are very proud in Ireland in ensuring people can live in their own communities. Very strong communities are essential in the way we do things. That is where my priority is right now. I am not against a referendum on putting housing into the Constitution but it is not where my priority is right now and certainly not in my first year as the Minister for housing. \n Deputy Rory Hearne  It is very disappointing to hear that. We are in a housing crisis and housing emergency now for well over a decade. One could argue in some respects that we have been in a housing crisis since the 1990s. House prices have been on the rise, then we had the crash, and now we are back into rising and unsustainable house prices. There is still something fundamentally wrong with our housing system, our housing market, the way we treat housing and the way we understand housing. Other countries, for example, Spain, have a right to housing in their constitutions. Their starting point in the creation of housing policy and the treatment of housing is that it is a human right. This matters because there is confusion; is it an investment commodity, is it something about a public good, or is it social need? The majority recommendation of the Housing Commission was very clear that there should be a referendum and the right to housing should be inserted into the Constitution, which would then guide all policy decisions and all our interactions around housing from a Government perspective. I am disappointed to hear it is not a priority for the Minister. \n Deputy James Browne  It is important to set out that putting it into the Constitution is not going to deliver one more house. This Government has set out that housing is a priority. This is evidenced by the fact that almost one in three euro in our national development plan is going towards housing delivery. This is not even including the funding for grids and roads, which are all prioritised towards housing delivery as well. Spain, for example, is engaging with our Department and Government because it is in a housing crisis. Their minister for housing is looking at schemes we are doing to see how they might work in Spain to help advance and deliver housing and affordable housing. Other countries such as Slovakia, Romania and France are also looking to Ireland. I had important meetings with the minister for housing from France only last week and with the ministers for housing from Denmark and Romania, all of whom are facing housing crises. Nobody has a simple answer to this at the moment. While reviewing whether we put that into the Constitution is important, let us not pretend it will deliver housing. ",

The changes agreed will also provide significantly stronger tenancy protections and are finely balanced between the interests of tenants and the need for further private investment in the rental market across the country. Further information is available here: www.gov.ie/en/department-of-housing-local-government-and-heritage/press-releases/government-to-introduce-major-reforms-to-the-rental-sector/.  The modifications to rent controls have been informed by the findings of the Housing Agency review of Rent Pressure Zones and Potential Policy Options and its preferred recommendation to modify the operation of the existing RPZ rent controls. The report can be accessed here: www.housingagency.ie/publications/review-rent-pressure-zones-report.  Resetting of rents to market value will be allowed for new tenancies created (i.e. first time tenancy between parties) on or after 1 March 2026 as part of the reform of rent controls. However, resetting of rents will not be allowed where the preceding tenancy, if any, was terminated via a ‘no fault eviction’. Rent re-setting will only be allowed where a tenant terminates their tenancy or breaches their tenant obligations or where the dwelling is no longer suitable to the accommodation needs of the tenant household.  For existing tenancies (i.e. those created on or before 28 February 2026), resetting of rents to market value will not be allowed. The restriction on annual rent increases will continue to apply.  Legislation is being prepared and will be published later this year to give effect to these policy measures. ",

        "answerText": " Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage  I propose to take Questions Nos. 60 and 116 together.  The clear focus of this Government is to increase the supply of new build social and affordable homes. This is key to addressing the housing challenge and in particular preventing and ultimately eliminating long term homelessness, and that unquestionably must be the priority for all local authorities.  The social housing PPP programme was announced in 2014 aiming to deliver circa 1,500 units in three phases (Bundles 1 –3) with 25-year maintenance and tenancy management commitments before transferring to local authorities. In 2021, the Housing for All plan extended the initiative, identifying Bundles 4 –7 to deliver approximately 2,850 additional units.  Bundles 1 & 2 completed in 2021 delivered 999 new social homes across 8 counties.  Bundle 3 targeted the delivery of a further 486 social homes across 6 sites in 4 Local Authority areas. Legal proceeding have issued in relation to this matter and as this matter is now before the courts, it is not appropriate to make any further comment.  I have asked my Department to initiate, with the help of the NDFA, a review of PPP Bundles 4 to 7 to consider potential options and determine the optimal procurement and delivery strategy for the Exchequer.

        "answerText": " Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage (Deputy James Browne)  The Government committed in January 2025 to introduce an all of government national housing plan to follow Housing for All, underpinned by multi-annual funding. As part of this, all Departments have examined potential actions to further scale up the delivery of homes of all tenures.  A programme of targeted stakeholder engagement has been undertaken. Written submissions have been received from across Government and from a range of external stakeholders including state agencies, the community and voluntary sector, industry and academics. These submissions have been carefully considered. I have also met with many stakeholders to hear first-hand what actions they think should be reflected in the Plan.  There is a high rate of savings in the State and indeed the high savings deposit rate we see in Ireland today reflects the success of our economy in recent years. Some stakeholders have suggested that more could be done to harness those domestic savings to fund housing delivery, including introducing a state savings scheme similar to the Livret A model in France.  I would like thank to Deputy Hearne for providing the Social Democrats “Homes for Ireland’ State savings scheme proposal which puts forward a similar model to provide capital for the delivery of affordable homes.  As the area of savings comes under the remit of the Minister for Finance, I have asked my Department to engage with his Department to establish the potential benefits of the introduction of any further new savings scheme specific to housing over and above the products which are already available to the public.

        "answerText": " Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage  The Residential Tenancies Acts 2004-2025 (the RTA) regulate the landlord-tenant relationship in the private rented sector and sets out the rights and obligations of landlords and tenants. The RTA apply to every dwelling that is the subject of a tenancy, subject to a limited number of exceptions.  The dwellings to which the RTA does not apply are set out in section 3(2) of the RTA, and include for example, a dwelling within which the landlord also resides.  Traditionally, rent-a-room arrangements are entered by students and others residing in ‘digs’ or family homes where goodwill exists to ensure that both lodgers and home owners are happy with the arrangement. It is possible for rent-a-room arrangements to be formalised by way of a licence agreement between the parties to a rent-a-room arrangement, including in respect of student digs, but this is a matter of choice for the parties themselves to agree on.  Digs accommodation and licence arrangements, generally, are an integral housing solution for students and other renters as well as an important source of revenue and, in some circumstances, social interaction for homeowners. Any attempt at regulating ‘digs’ or licence arrangements could well impact negatively on the supply of this traditional and important source of accommodation for students and others.  I have no plans at this time to alter this position; however, the RTA is kept under constant review to ensure that they are fit for purpose. ",

While this work is being undertaken, the measures and schemes in Housing for All continue to advance delivery of secure and affordable housing. Affordable housing schemes are now operating at scale and the affordable housing delivery programme continues to expand and develop year on year, supported by unprecedented levels of state investment.  Key schemes such as the Local Authority Affordable Purchase Scheme, the Help to Buy Incentive, the First Home Scheme and the Vacant Property Refurbishment Grant are available to help make home ownership more affordable.  Cost rental is gaining traction as a new tenure type. It is a key element of the Government's strategy to improve affordability in the rental sector. Nearly 4,000 cost rental homes have been delivered by Approved Housing Bodies, the LDA and Local Authorities since the launch of Housing for All.  We will continue to liaise with our delivery partners to further the development of the affordable housing delivery programme and to ensure that each scheme, individually and working together, responds effectively to affordable housing need at national and at local level.

        "answerText": " Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage  Consistent with the provisions in the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2014, the Housing Assistance Payment (HAP) scheme is considered to be a social housing support and consequently households in receipt of a payment under the HAP scheme are not eligible to remain on the main housing waiting list. However, acknowledging that some households on the waiting list, who avail of HAP, have expectations that they would receive a more traditional form of social housing support, Ministerial directions have issued to ensure that, should they so choose, HAP recipients can avail of a move to other forms of social housing support through a transfer list.  Furthermore, local authorities are also directed that HAP recipients who apply to go on the transfer list should get full credit for the time they spent on the waiting list and be placed on the transfer list with no less favourable terms than if they had remained on the waiting list.  The practical operation of transfer lists is a matter for each local authority to manage, on the basis of its own scheme of letting priorities. The making of such schemes is a reserved function of the local authority and as such is a matter for the elected members.  The Housing Commission has recommended the resetting of the HAP scheme as a short- to medium-term support for households eligible for social housing, with those households then remaining on the social housing waiting list. My Department is actively considering the recommendations of the Housing Commission including those that relate to the HAP scheme. ",

Once a proposal is established via the SHIF process it then progresses through the various stages of the capital appraisal process.

        "answerText": " Minister for Health  In January 2025, Beaumont Hospital launched its five-year strategy Building Excellence in Care, Together, focused on delivering patient-centred care and modernising infrastructure to meet evolving healthcare needs.  Funding for current expenditure is allocated on an annual basis through the Estimates process with future levels of funding considered as part of the national estimates and budgetary process. From 2020-2025 the overall budget for Beaumont Hospital increased by 37%. WTE allocation increased by 15% and bed numbers increased by 2% in the same period.  Additionally, a third CT scanner is now in-situ. The Hospital has increased CT ED and inpatient capacity over the past few months. In Q3 2025, there have been an extra 120 ED and inpatient imaging procedures per month compared to Q1.  There are a number of significant proposals for capital investment in Beaumont Hospital, and all are progressing through the requisite design and planning stages. These proposals are being managed through the HSE capital development process in line with the Infrastructure Guidelines. As a live hospital campus there is an added complexity in terms of planning, sequencing and enabling each of these projects. Our Model 4 acute hospitals require a significant amount of enabling works to prepare for larger projects. These key enabling pieces are ongoing.  In May 2025, the proposed new Emergency Department received a final grant of planning. The project is now progressing to detailed design stage.  In October 2024, planning permission for a 95-bed ward block was granted. The proposal is now at detailed design. Proposals for a 64-bed Critical Care Unit (CCU) are dependent on the relocation of the existing Endoscopy Department. In March 2025, final grant of planning was received for this new Endoscopy Department. It is now progressing through to detailed design stage. In parallel, design of the 64 bed CCU is underway at preliminary design stage. ",

All of these proposals are being managed through the HSE capital development process in line with the Infrastructure Guidelines.  As a live hospital campus there is an added complexity in terms of planning, sequencing and enabling each of these projects. Our Model 4 acute hospitals require a significant amount of enabling works to prepare for larger projects. These key enabling pieces are ongoing at Beaumont.  In May 2025, the proposed new Emergency Department received a final grant of planning. The project is now progressing to detailed design stage.  As the Health Service Executive is responsible for the delivery of public healthcare infrastructure projects, I have asked the HSE to respond to you directly in relation to this matter. ",

        "answerText": " Minister for Health  I propose to take Questions Nos. 583 and 627 together.  The Long-Term Illness (LTI) Scheme was established under Section 59(3) of the Health Act 1970 (as amended). Regulations were made in 1971, 1973 and 1975, prescribing 16 conditions to be covered by the Scheme. These are: acute leukaemia; mental handicap; cerebral palsy; mental illness (in a person under 16); cystic fibrosis; multiple sclerosis; diabetes insipidus; muscular dystrophies; diabetes mellitus; parkinsonism; epilepsy; phenylketonuria; haemophilia; spina bifida; hydrocephalus; and conditions arising from the use of Thalidomide.  Under the LTI Scheme, patients receive drugs, medicines, and medical and surgical appliances directly related to the treatment of their illness, free of charge. While there are currently no plans to extend the list of conditions, it is important to remember that the LTI Scheme exists within a wider eligibility framework.  People who cannot, without undue hardship, arrange for the provision of medical services for themselves and their dependants may be eligible for a medical card under the General Medical Services (GMS) Scheme. In accordance with the provisions of the Health Act 1970 (as amended), eligibility for a medical card is determined by the HSE.  In certain circumstances the HSE may exercise discretion and grant a medical card, even though an applicant exceeds the income guidelines, where he or she faces difficult financial circumstances, such as extra costs arising from illness. The HSE afford applicants the opportunity to furnish supporting documentation to determine whether undue hardship exists and to fully take account of all relevant circumstances that may benefit them in assessment. In circumstances where an applicant is still over the income limit for a medical card, they are then assessed for a GP visit card, which entitles the applicant to GP visits without charge.  The issue of granting medical card eligibility based on having a particular disability or illness was previously examined in 2014 by the HSE Expert Panel on Medical Need and Medical Card Eligibility. The Group concluded that it was not feasible, desirable, nor ethically justifiable to list medical conditions in priority order for medical card eligibility. In following the Expert Group’s advice, a person’s means remains the main qualifier for a medical card.  Under the Drugs Payment Scheme (DPS), no individual or family pays more than €80 a month towards the cost of approved prescribed medicines. The DPS is not means tested and is available to anyone ordinarily resident in Ireland. The DPS significantly reduces the cost burden for families and individuals with ongoing expenditure on medicines.  There has been a significant focus on improving access to and the affordability of healthcare services over the last few years. This includes reductions in the DPS threshold, expansion of access to free GP care, and the abolition of all public in-patient hospital charges for children and adults. These measures continue to create a health and social care service that offers affordable access to quality healthcare.  Individuals may also be entitled to claim tax relief on the cost of their medical expenses, including medicines prescribed by a doctor, dentist, or consultant. Relief is at the standard tax rate of 20%. ",

        "answerText": " Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage  I recently secured an additional €50 million on foot of the National Development Plan discussions to expand the social housing Second-Hand Acquisitions Programme this year, bringing the budget available for the programme to €375 million.  I am targeting this additional funding at acquisitions supporting households, particularly larger families with children, to exit long-term emergency homeless accommodation. To this end, the funding has been allocated to the eight city and city and county councils, which have the highest number of households that have been emergency accommodation for longer than 24 months in the Dublin region and 12 months or more in the remaining four authorities.  It is a distinct and separate allocation within the broader Second-Hand Acquisitions Programme.  Recognising the lead-in time required to complete such acquisitions, any uncommitted or unspent monies from the additional €50m allocation can be carried forward into 2026. This will allow local authorities to maximise the impact of the funding for vulnerable households. Funding carried forward will remain ring-fenced and separate from any allocation provided generally under the Second-Hand Acquisitions Programme in 2026.  Separately, all local authorities have been given approval to enter into financial commitments for 2026 to a value of up to 30% of their original 2025 acquisitions budget. This flexibility applies to acquisitions for all priority cohorts, including for tenancy sustainment, exits from homelessness, and for other priority groups, such as persons with disabilities, older persons, care leavers, &c.  This is not a new or separate funding stream. Rather it is a flexibility afforded to local authorities that effectively establishes a standard multi-annual approach for the programme, providing local authorities with greater certainty of funding into next year and ensuring priority acquisitions initiated this year and in particular in the last quarter of 2025 which are unlikely to complete until 2026 can continue to be progress.

        "answerText": " Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage  CALF funding is capital support provided to Approved Housing Bodies (AHBs) by local authorities to facilitate the funding of construction and purchase of new social housing homes. This loan facility can support between 25% and 30% of the eligible capital cost of the housing project, with the remaining finance sourced by the AHBs from private lenders (usually the Housing Finance Agency (HFA)).  The properties are provided to local authorities for social housing use under long-term lease arrangements known as Payment and Availability Agreements. A nominal interest rate of 2% fixed per annum is charged by the local authority on the initial capital amount.  Repayments on either the capital or interest are not required during the term of the loan (between 10 and 30 years), although where an AHB chooses to, repayments can be made during the term. At the end of the term, the outstanding capital amount plus the interest accrued, is owed and repayable to the local authority. The local authority issues the CALF monies to the AHB and the local authority, in turn, recoups same from the Department.

Cost Rental Equity Loan (CREL) funding is available to AHBs to provide affordable rented accommodation to those on middle incomes. The nature of the cost rental model means that cost rental homes are made available at a certain rent level, which is needed to cover the costs of delivery and maintenance of the cost rental homes, and must be at least 25 per cent below prevailing market rents.  Applications for CREL are regularly received by my Department and as such the assessment and approval of applications on hand is continual. As with all Exchequer-supported projects, my Department, as approving authority, assesses each project application for suitability, value for money and compliance with the various requirements of the applicable funding scheme.

        "answerText": " Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage  I propose to take Questions Nos. 564, 565 and 566 together.  Cost Rental Equity Loan (CREL) funding is available to AHBs to provide affordable rented accommodation to those on middle incomes. The nature of the cost rental model means that cost rental homes are made available at a certain rent level, which is needed to cover the costs of delivery and maintenance of the cost rental homes, and must be at least 25 per cent below prevailing market rents.  Applications for CREL are regularly received by my Department and as such the assessment and approval of applications on hand is continual. As with all Exchequer-supported projects, my Department, as approving authority, assesses each project application for suitability, value for money and compliance with the various requirements of the applicable funding scheme. The processing time for individual applications can vary significantly depending upon the complexity and specific characteristics of each application.  The Table below sets out the number of CREL funding approvals granted from the beginning of 2025 to date by Local Authority, and the number granted for which the Department received the report in 2024.     Local Authority    No. of Funding Approvals Granted in 2025    No. of Funding Approvals Granted in 2025 where the report was received in 2024      Cork City    8    3      Cork County    1    0      Dun Laoghaire - Rathdown    2    0      Dublin City    2    0      Fingal    6    1      Galway City    2    0      Kildare    2    0      Kilkenny    1    0      Laois    1    0      Limerick    2    0      Louth    3    0      Meath    4    0      South Dublin    3    1      Westmeath    3    1      Wicklow    1    0       TOTAL      41      6      It is important to note that there will always be projects on hand with my Department which are either under assessment or the subject of further engagement with LAs or AHBs. This is perfectly normal in the context of the Social and Affordable housing projects which have been or are being handled by my Department currently which are scheduled for delivery in the period 2025 – 2029.  Details of proposals awaiting approval cannot be released due to reasons of commercial sensitivity. However, my Department can confirm that it continues to work with the AHB sector to deliver cost rental homes at scale under the Cost Rental Equity Loan Scheme, with a view to achieving Housing For All targets.
