This has been reported widely and indeed already addressed via the parliamentary question procedure with questions directly to the relevant Minister.

These are ordinarily provided once a month and packaged to indicate when medication should be taken.  The State has never agreed to fund this and there has never been a fee associated with monitored dosage systems under the Pharmacy contract. This has always been the case and has been repeated in several HSE circulars to pharmacists.  The State has not imposed a new charge on MDS, also known as “blister packs”. This remains a private service provided by pharmacies. It is also understood that different approaches are taken by community pharmacies in respect of funding the use of MDS for medical card holders.  - Some have been blister packing their patient’s medicines for free,  - Some have been charging the patient privately for providing that service, and,  - Some have submitted claims for phased dispensing to the HSE when in reality they were using MDS. The State has never agreed to this last practice, and it is inappropriate claiming to do so.  As I stated in the Dáil on 16 December 2025, further analysis is required to determine to what extent the phased dispensing arrangements - which is funded for medical card holders under certain criteria - have been used in lieu of the provision of MDS (known as blister packing), a practice that would be classed as inappropriate claiming.

Phase 1 focused on Adult General and Specialist Medical and Surgical Care Settings and Phase 2 focused on Adult Emergency Care Settings. National implementation of these policies is a priority and has received significant Government investment since 2020.  The HSE CEO mandated that baseline implementation of both phases of the Framework be achieved by 31 December 2025 and this is on target to be achieved.  Prior to this, progress had been made with over 1,700 additional Registered Nurses (RNs) and Healthcare Assistants (HCAs) successfully recruited to deliver baseline implementation of the Framework across all in-patient wards and Emergency Departments nationally.  Since September 2025, further progress has been made with the recruitment of the additional 390 RNs and HCAs required to achieve baseline implementation. The HSE has advised that these remaining additional posts are progressing in line with the direction from the CEO, with recruitment at various stages of the process. ",

        "answerText": " Minister for Health  Caredoc staff represented by SIPTU and the INMO recently announced their intention to undertake industrial action with a series of work stoppages commencing on the 18th December 2025, as the organisation has refused to pass on a settlement to their staff that was reached under the auspices of the WRC in March 2025.  There were two pay deals for community and voluntary workers agreed in the WRC, firstly in October 2023 (8%) and secondly in March 2025 (9.25%). Co-operatives established to provide GP out-of-hours services, such as Caredoc, do not receive their funding from the HSE through section 39 grant arrangements, and were therefore not in scope of the WRC agreements. This was accepted by the unions in finalising the deal at the WRC. GP Out of Hours services are provided under the terms of the GMS contract between the HSE and individual GPs. This contract is governed by Section 58 of the Health Act. It was made clear that the model of funding, including pay funding for staff in these organisations, will be determined as part of the Strategic Review of General Practice that is currently underway.  However, in the interim the HSE committed under the auspices of the WRC in March 2025 to provide an additional funding allocation of €1.7m to Caredoc (South-East), ShannonDoc and Southdoc to ensure the maintenance of a sustainable workforce, of which €647,000 was allocated to Caredoc (South-East). This commitment has been fully honoured, and the additional funding has already issued to these organisations. It is regrettable that Caredoc has to date refused to pass this funding on to its employees.  The most straight forward resolution of the strike action is that Caredoc immediately pay over the funding provided for the staff in Caredoc South-East, as the failure to comply with the WRC settlement is the basis of the unions industrial action. CareDoc have agreed to return to mediation with the HSE, and I would urge them to continue to engage through this process to bring this matter to a resolution as quickly as possible in the interest of the service users.

        "answerText": " Minister for Education and Youth  The school to which the Deputy refers was approved to enter the department’s pipeline for a project under my Department's Additional School Accommodation (ASA) Scheme. The project will provide one Multi-Media room, one Textiles room, one Graphics room, one Construction room, one Technology prep room, one Science lab & prep area and one Project store. The inclusion of a PE Hall or GP/Dining Hall depends on site feasibility, constraints, and input from the Local Authority and Heritage Officer. The project was devolved for delivery to the Cork Education & Training Board.  The Stage 1 report has been submitted and is currently under review. Once this review is complete, my Department will be in a position to provide clarity on the accommodation to be progressed. Given the complexities of this project, the evaluation will require a comprehensive review from both technical and cost perspectives to ensure full compliance with cost requirements, procedural standards, and the defined project scope. All projects, including this one, will undergo the necessary due diligence outlined in the public Infrastructure Guidelines.? Managing timing, scope, and cost is crucial to staying within budgetary limits for the overall program.  In July the Government announced a capital allocation of €7.55 billion for the Department of Education and Youth for the period 2026-2030 under the National Development Plan. As part of this NDP allocation my department will place a strong emphasis on provision for children with special educational needs, with a particular focus on meeting annual school place needs. In relation to project rollout for Large-Scale projects and Additional School Accommodation scheme projects, the approach will be to continue to maximise the capacity of the existing school estate as much as possible in the first instance and provide necessary additional capacity through targeted and prioritised project rollout over the course of 2026 to 2030 period to meet the most urgent and prioritised needs.  Government departments are currently in the process of publishing their sectoral NDP Implementation Plans. The sectoral plan for the Education and Youth sector will be published next week and the first tranche of projects to progress to construction will be published in January. This NDP Implementation Plan will optimise outputs from the NDP allocations, with a strong focus on maximising existing school capacity, progressing priority projects where local capacity across schools in the area is insufficient, and ensuring delivery that is affordable, offers value for money, and meets functional needs.

Some €110 million has been allocated since 2022 for the enhancement and refurbishment of existing community centres and the construction of new centres.  I am committed to delivering further iterations of the scheme in the coming years in line with the commitment in the Programme for Government for this to become a permanent rolling fund. I expect to deliver the next round of CCIF next year, which will focus on refurbishment work in existing community centres. The details in this regard are currently being finalised.  My Department also supports community facilities with enhancement works through a range of other funding streams including through the CLÁR programme, LEADER and the Town and Village Renewal Scheme. I would encourage organisations to check my Department’s website for information on funding opportunities and announcements. ",

        "answerText": " Minister for Social Protection  The European Commission made a recommendation in November 2022 on the recognition of COVID-19 as an occupational disease. This was a non-binding recommendation and recognition of occupational diseases remains a Member State competence. The Commission did not make a recommendation in relation to long COVID.  Recognition as an occupational disease confers different entitlements in different Member States, with employers paying the compensation in some countries and social insurance systems paying in others. The level and duration of payments also vary greatly between Member States.  The Commission's recommendation was fully considered during the preparation of my Department's ‘Report on measures to include long COVID in the Occupational Injuries Benefit Regulations’. This report found that COVID-19 does not meet the criteria for recognition as an occupational illness under the Social Welfare Consolidation Act 2005.  The statutory criteria for Occupational Injuries Benefit require that the disease or injury was caused as a risk of the person’s occupation and is not a risk outside of that profession. Community transmission of COVID-19 became dominant by the summer of 2020.  Specifically, presumptions about workplace transmission would not be sustainable on a general basis in the current environment where infection rates are low. Therefore, it has not been possible since then to establish with confidence a general assumption that the disease has been contracted through a person's occupation and not through community transmission.  It is important to note that even if Ireland did recognise COVID-19 as an occupational disease, this would not encompass long COVID and would only apply to new claims for new cases of COVID-19. Thus, it would not benefit those who contracted COVID-19 during the pandemic.  My Department's report found that the Temporary Scheme of Paid Leave for Public Health Service Employees was the appropriate channel through which a targeted sectoral support should be considered. This Temporary Scheme is a matter for the Minister for Public Expenditure, Infrastructure, Public Service Reform and Digitalisation. The scheme has been extended a number of times, most recently to conclude on 31 December 2025. Any employee remaining unwell after that date may utilise the full provisions of the Public Service Sick Leave Scheme which will provide further support.  My Department continues to provide a suite of income supports to those who cannot work due to illness and disability, including those who have not recovered following a COVID-19 related illness.  I trust this clarifies the matter for the Deputy. ",

        "answerText": " Minister for Justice, Home Affairs and Migration  The Rules of Court set out how court cases must be processed in a way that is consistent, efficient and fair to ensure justice is done properly and without undue delays. The rule making authority for the District Court is the District Court Rules Committee established under section 71 of the Courts of Justice Act, 1936. The rule-making authority for the Circuit Court is the Circuit Court Rules Committee, established under section 69 of the Courts of Justice Act 1936.  All the Rules Committees are independent in their functions. The Committees may annul or alter rules and make new rules with the concurrence of the Minister. The Court Service provides secretarial, clerical and administrative support to the Rules Committees. However, it is the Court Rules Committees and not the Courts Service that has responsibility for the initiation or alteration of Rules of Court, as these Rules relate to matters within the responsibility of the courts and the judiciary, who are subject only to the Constitution and the law, and are independent in the exercise of their judicial functions.  I am informed by my officials that my Department and the Department of Health have been engaging with the Court Service regarding any required amendments to Rules of Court in advance of the commencement of s 232 of the Health (Assisted Human Reproduction) Act 2024. Such amendments are matters for the Court Rules Committees, which then submit draft rules to me as Minister for my concurrence.  On December 8th and 9th last, I received draft Circuit Court Rules (Donor Assisted Human Reproduction) 2025 and the equivalent District Court Rules. These are currently being considered, with a view to being in a position to concur shortly. ",

Through the departments close working with leaders in digital health in all other EU member states, we have learned a lot about what worked well and what was not good. We have also leveraged our contacts in digital health globally and in the UK to inform both our Digital for Care strategic framework and to inform direction for the EHR and market engagement.  The HSE have also taken on board advice and guidance from their EHR strategic partner and industry insights companies such as Gartner, who are independent of any vendor and therefore can provide unbiassed advice. Important also to note that the HSE have their own experience of vendor engagement with EHR systems which will be factored into the process.  Finally, DPER will be establishing an external Peer Review Group for the programme and we understand, this will be chaired by the former senior leader in public procurement. ",

We are seeing a gradual shift in the market towards more open standards but for major vendors they are still operating is a way that makes this challenging. Important regulator developments such as the European Health Data Space and the Health Information Bill will require specific categories of data to conform to standards and for specific interoperability requirements to be met by all EHR vendors for their products to be certified for sale and use in Europe. Additionally, we are starting to see consensus on major interoperability standards emerge, with increased momentum behind adoption globally. For instance FHIR and OpenEHR are gaining real traction now and indeed the National Shared Care Record that the HSE are developing is based on these standards.  As we approach the market for electronic health record systems in 2026, technical specifications that form part of the requirements that get published will need to address this issue. However, experience to date would suggest that this will still represent an ongoing risk if any of the large EHR providers is selected.  Ireland is not facing this challenge alone. We are now very well connected with counterparts internationally so that we can more easily speak with one voice to industry. ",
