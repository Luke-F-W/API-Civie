The Labour Force Survey (LFS) is a household survey which provides quarterly statistics on employment and unemployment and is the official source of labour market estimates in the State. The primary classification used for the LFS results is the ILO (International Labour Organisation) labour force classification.  Respondents to the LFS are asked whether they have at least one long-lasting condition or difficulty and the most recent figures available are for Q2 2019.  The employment rate for any category of persons is calculated as the number of employed persons aged 15-64 years in that category expressed as a percentage of the total number of persons aged 15 to 64 in that category.  The employment rate for persons aged 15-64 years classified as having a disability was 39.9% in Q2 2019.  There is currently no corresponding EU 28 data available. ",

[52888/19] ",
        "answerText": " Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform  In accordance with requirements under the Disability Act 2005, the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform is required to report to the National Disability Authority (NDA) on the numbers of people with a disability working in the Civil Service only. Other Ministers have similar responsibilities for the wider public service.  Under Section 47 of the Disability Act, all public bodies are required:  - in so far as practicable take all reasonable measures to promote and support the employment by it of persons with disabilities, and  - ensure, unless there is good reason to the contrary for not doing so, that it reaches any compliance targets (i.e., that not less than 3% of the persons employed by it are persons with disabilities).  As part of the Comprehensive Employment Strategy for People with Disabilities, the public service employment target of people with disabilities will be increased on a phased basis from 3% to 6% by 2024.  The NDA publishes full details on public sector compliance with this target on its website.  http://nda.ie/Publications/Employment/Employment-of-people-with-disabilities-in-the-public-service/Reports-on-compliance-with-public-sector-jobs-target/?=OpenDocument&pageNumber=1 .

        "answerText": " Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform  My colleague, the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport and the National Transport Authority (NTA) have primary responsibility for meeting this commitment.  Recognising the prevailing market structure for taxi services is central to this issue and as there are no large unitary fleet operators who can easily be compelled to meet such a requirement, I understand the NTA (a) continues to fund a programme of grants to increase the level of wheelchair accessible taxis, and (b) has amended the vehicle specification to qualify as a wheelchair-accessible taxi to reduce the level of investment required by individual taxi operators in order to comply.  The Office of Government Procurement (OGP) engages with the NTA and ensures that appropriate accessibility criteria are included in their central arrangements for taxi services.  Having regard to the above, the OGP established a Framework Agreement for the provision of taxi services in the Greater Dublin Area in September 2018. The tender competition to establish this Framework was designed to encourage participation on a fair and equal basis by Small and Medium Enterprises (SME’s) together with addressing the Programme for a Partnership Government commitment.

I am convinced that to drive increases in living standards into the future, SMEs and entrepreneurship need to be at the heart of our focus on innovation, productivity and growth.  Ireland has a diverse SME ecosystem, of innovation driven enterprises, high-growth and high-technology, family-owned, rural, owner-managers, traditional sectors, and a diverse profile of business owners including those with disabilities.  My overriding ambition is to unleash the potential of SMEs and entrepreneurs in boosting innovation, productivity and economic growth resulting in higher living standards for all our people.  The OECD review of SMEs and Entrepreneurship in Ireland, which I commissioned last year, recognises that there is well-spring of entrepreneurship right across the country. It also recognises that the Local Enterprise Offices have made a marked improvement in the promotion of and supports for entrepreneurs and it is the LEOs that are the first stop shop for anyone thinking of starting a business, including those with disabilities.  I am ambitious for every region and want to achieve a further increase in entrepreneurs starting and scaling businesses in every county and the development of our entrepreneurial hubs and enterprise centres has been a key enabler of increases in recent years.  The 31 Local Enterprise Offices (LEOs), located in the Local Authorities nationwide are the ‘first-stop-shop’ for advice and guidance, financial assistance and other supports for anyone intending to start or grow a business.  The LEOs can offer direct grant aid to any microenterprises (up to 10 employees) in the manufacturing and internationally traded services sector which, over time, have the potential to develop into strong export entities. Subject to certain eligibility criteria, the LEOs can provide financial assistance within three main categories:  - Feasibility Grants (investigating the potential of a business idea)  - Priming Grants (to part-fund a start-up)  - Business Development grants for existing businesses that want to expand.  For Start- ups or expanding businesses, the LEOs may be able to offer ‘soft’ support in the form of training or provide a mentor to work with the business proposer including courses such as the Start Your Own Business programme guides clients through the various aspects of business and business planning and the Mentor Programme which is designed to match up the knowledge, skills, insights and entrepreneurial capability of experienced business practitioners with small business owner/ managers who need practical and strategic one to one advice and guidance.  I will continue to ensure equal opportunities for entrepreneurship across the population and to address gaps in the self-employment and entrepreneurship activity rates of women, youth, those with disabilities and migrants. My agencies will continue to work very closely with the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection and Intreo Offices in every county to ensure those seeking to get back to work or start a business are aware of the range of supports available.

        "showAs": " 48. Deputy Margaret Murphy O'Mahony asked the Minister for Health the action being taken to reduce the number of overdue assessments of need under the Disability Act 2005; and if he will make a statement on the matter. [48760/19] ",
        "answerText": " Deputy Margaret Murphy O'Mahony  What measures are being taken to reduce the large numbers waiting for assessments of need under the Disability Act 2005? \n Minister of State at the Department of Health (Deputy Finian McGrath)  I thank Deputy Murphy O'Mahony for raising this very important issue.  The Disability Act 2005 provides for assessments of need for people with disabilities. Any child thought to have a disability born on or after 1 June 2002 is eligible to apply for an assessment of need, which will detail his or her health needs arising from any disability. Since the Act's commencement in 2007, there have been significant year-on-year increases in the number of children applying for both assessments of need and disability services generally. Regrettably, these increases have led to the extended waiting periods experienced by children and their families.  In order to improve the assessment of need process and ensure that children receive interventions as soon as possible, the HSE has developed a new standard operating procedure for the assessment of need process. This measure will ensure that children with disabilities and their families access appropriate assessment and intervention as soon as possible while at the same time bringing consistency to the assessment of need process across all community healthcare organisations of the HSE. It is intended that the procedure will be implemented from quarter 1 of 2020.  In addition, the HSE disability services are currently engaged in a major reconfiguration of their existing therapy resources for children with disabilities into multidisciplinary geographically based teams. This is part of the HSE's national programme on progressing disability services for children and young people from birth to 18 years of age.  The key objective of this programme is to bring about equity of access to disability services and consistency of service delivery, with a clear pathway for children with disabilities and their families to services, regardless of where they live, what school they go to or the nature of the individual child's difficulties. Evidence to date from areas where this has been rolled out shows that implementation of this programme will also have a positive impact on waiting lists for both assessments of need and therapy provision.  An increase in the number of therapy posts has been identified as a priority requirement to meet current unmet need and projected future needs in children's disability services nationally. In this regard, last year's budget provided for the recruitment of an additional 100 therapy posts to help reduce the long waiting times for assessment and to support interventions for children who need them. The recruitment process for these posts is well under way. There were 63 in post by the end of the first week in November, and the remaining 37 are expected to be in post before the end of the year. \n Deputy Margaret Murphy O'Mahony  As the Minister of State knows, under the Act the assessment is supposed to start within three months of application and to be completed within another three months. This is not happening. Right across west Cork and indeed nationally I have heard of many cases in which the parents, who obviously know their children best, know what is wrong with their children but just need this official assessment done and an official diagnosis. Many people can afford to go private; many more cannot. Even for those who can, this diagnosis is often not accepted. It is therefore imperative that this list is cleared in order that parents get these official diagnoses. The diagnosis opens many doors, including those that will allow children access to special needs assessment, SNAs, so it is very important. The Minister of State will be aware that overdue assessments under the Act rose from 3,568 at the end of March to 3,768 at the end of June of this year. I recently received figures for the end of September showing 4,100 now overdue, so we have seen an increase of 15%. This is not acceptable, with respect. \n Deputy Finian McGrath  I am conscious that timely access to assessments and therapies is imperative in a child's development. I fully understand that delays in accessing services are a source of great concern for children and their families. While not addressing all needs, it is important that the process has begun. I accept the Deputy's point that it is very important we get in early when it comes to these young children with disabilities. What are we doing? As I mentioned in my response, the recruitment process is under way. There were delays with trade union issues within the HSE. As I said earlier, however, 63 were in post by the end of the first week of November and we have been told that the remaining 37 are expected to be in post before the year end. This new resource will result in additional new therapy posts ranging from speech and language therapy to occupational therapy, physiotherapy, social workers and psychologists. I am confident that the initiatives I have outlined will have a significant positive impact on reducing waiting times for assessment of need over the course of the next year. \n Deputy Margaret Murphy O'Mahony  What the Minister of State is trying to do is obviously not working. If there has been an increase in the number of overdue assessments in the past six months, there is something wrong. I acknowledge that the numbers went down in 2018, but this year they are increasing, and that is just not good enough. The Minister of State spoke of the importance of early intervention, and it is hugely important, but without this diagnosis people cannot get early intervention. This is cruel and if there is no early intervention, it can have a detrimental effect on the child as he or she grows up. I ask the Minister of State to put something in place for these children and their parents. We must remember that behind every child affected are parents and siblings who are all going through this torture together. I therefore ask the Minister of State to do something to reduce the numbers on this list. \n Deputy Finian McGrath  I take this issue very seriously and take on board the point the Deputy makes. It is essential we put these early intervention services in place. As I said, though, the key issue is that the staff numbers have increased dramatically. We are trying to deal with this. We have also set up the health service reform programme, which seeks to have health and social care networks in place. The HSE is also establishing a total of 96 children's disability networks across each of the nine CHO areas. These networks comprise special multidisciplinary teams to work with complex disability needs. Each network will have a children's disability network manager with specialised expertise in providing clinical disability services.  The appointment of these network managers can now proceed following the recent Labour Court ruling. I am optimistic that this will improve the services. I accept the point that we must act and hope to have these 37 new posts filled before Christmas. \n Acting Chairman (Deputy Bernard J. Durkan)  It has been agreed that Deputy Murphy O'Mahony will ask Question No. 50 on behalf of Deputy Michael McGrath. ",

        "answerText": " Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport  I propose to take Questions Nos. 267 and 268 together.  Council Directive (EU) 2017/159 on the implementation of the social partners’ agreement on the Work in Fishing Convention aims to enhance the working and living conditions for fishers working in the fishing sector on vessels registered in an EU Member State. As the agreement is a social partnership agreement, the Directive merely implements the Agreement as agreed between the social partners in 2012, and the Agreement itself was not subject to any changes during the discussions on the Directive in the Social Questions Working Party. My Department is supportive of the objective of the Directive.  On 9th October, my Department issued Marine Notice 42 of 2019, to provide key stakeholders with a brief overview of some of the main changes that will come into effect once the draft legislation has been finalised. Summarising the provisions of Article 6 of the Annex to Council Directive (EU) 2017/159, Marine Notice 42 of 2019 states that, “fishers who are 16 or 17 years of age may perform duties provided that they are no longer subject to compulsory full-time schooling, they have completed a basic pre-sea training course, their mental and physical well-being is fully protected and they have received adequate instruction”.  The requirement to complete a basic pre-sea training course is a long established practice. Under the provisions of S.I. No. 587/2001 Fishing Vessel (Basic Safety Training) Regulations, 2001, a new entrant, defined as “a person who is for the first time gainfully employed or engaged as a crew member” must complete a safety training course before proceeding to sea. Bord Iascaigh Mhara provides Basic Safety Training for new entrants. In keeping with the requirements of S.I. No. 587/2001, the training consists of three elements: Personal Survival Techniques (STCW-95 Certificate), Elementary First Aid (STCW-95 Certificate) and Fire Prevention and Safety Awareness.  More generally in relation to the safety of workers, the Safety, Health and Welfare at Work Act 2005 and its subsidiary regulations cover all workers, irrespective of age or work activity. There is a statutory responsibility for a risk assessment to be carried and maintained and that safety controls are set out in the employer’s legally required safety statement. Where the employer’s risk assessment finds that only light work on fishing vessels can be done safely by anyone over 15 and under 18, then it is the employer's legal responsibility to ensure that such a limitation on the work and workers is imposed.  It should be noted that Part 6, Chapter 1 of the Safety, Health and Welfare at Work (General Application) Regulations 2007 (S.I. No 299 of 2007), relating to the protection of children and young persons, includes provisions around the employer carrying out risk assessments to determine any specific risks to the safety, health and welfare of children (under 16) and young persons (under 18) arising from how work is carried out. Any such risk assessment should be sufficiently robust to determine if the work involved is beyond the physical or psychological capacity of the child or young person, and take account of the use of harmful substances, extremes of heat, cold, noise or vibration in the work which a child/young person may not recognize as risks. It should be noted that this legislation falls under the remit of the Department of Business, Enterprise and Innovation. ",

        "answerText": " Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport  Council Directive (EU) 2017/159 on the implementation of the social partners’ agreement on the Work in Fishing Convention aims to enhance the working and living conditions for fishers working on vessels registered in an EU member state. The Directive implements an Agreement between the General Confederation of Agricultural Cooperatives in the European Union (Cogeca), the European Transport Workers' Federation (ETF) and the Association of National Organization’s of Fishing Enterprises in the European Union (Europêche). These organisations represent the employer and employee representative organisations in the fishing sector across the European Union. As the agreement is a social partnership agreement, the Directive merely implements the Agreement as agreed between the social partners in 2012, and the Agreement itself was not subject to any changes during the discussions on the Directive in the Social Questions Working Party. My Department is supportive of the objective of the Directive to enhance the working and living conditions for fishers working on vessels registered in an EU Member State.  An important aspect of the transposition of the Directive is the requirement for consultation with stakeholders. On 16 November 2018, my Department published Marine Notice 42 of 2018, which invited stakeholders to contribute their views on Council Directive (EU) 2017/159. The consultation process resulted in the Department receiving seven submissions, which were reviewed and published on the Department’s website  https://www.gov.ie/en/publication/1ee9a2-responses-to-the-consultation-on-ilo-work-in-fishing-convention-2007/.  Subsequently, my officials met with representatives of the various fisheries organisations to discuss the transposition of the Directive. The outcome from the Department’s consultations with stakeholders made an important contribution to the drafting of the package of Regulations required to ensure the transposition of the Directive.  This work is at an advanced stage and my officials are currently working closely with the Office of the Parliamentary Counsel on the drafting of a package of Regulations in order to ensure the transposition of the Directive.

I am currently planning the capital offering for 2020, and I will look carefully at this area again, taking account of the likely demand for fire and other safety measures.  In recent years, capital funding has been made available for the maintenance and improvement of community/not for profit services. This funding is made available in order to protect previous State investment where it exists. Funding has also assisted not-for-profit services which may lack the financial capacity to invest funding into maintenance or improvement works.  The capital scheme for 2020 is under development. ",

The Report identified around 4,000 people (based on 2008 census) with disabilities in Ireland living in congregated settings, defined as a residential setting where people live with ten or more people.  The Programme for Partnership Government contains a commitment to continue to move people with disabilities out of congregated settings, to enable them to live independently and to be included in the community.  The objective is to reduce this figure by one-third by 2021 and ultimately, to eliminate all congregated settings.  By the end of this year, we will have exceeded this target and under 2,100 people with a disability will remain living in congregated settings. I want to emphasise that the appropriate supports and resources are being put in place to ensure that people are supported as they move out of residential centres. The model of care for individuals will be based on a person centred plan (PCP). The PCP may change over time in line with an individual’s needs and circumstances and the model of service delivery applicable at a particular time.  Any opportunity for residents to live in smaller settings in the community will come after considerable planning and discussion with those residents and their families. It will be on the basis that it will enhance their life, and anyone who moves will continue to access the services they require.  The HSE has prioritised the transition of a further 160 people from congregated settings in 2019 under its Service Plan, and I am informed that 78 people have moved into their homes in the community at the end of September this year.  As the HSE is responsible for leading out on the recommendations of \"Time to Move on from Congregated Settings - A Strategy for Community Inclusion\", I have asked the HSE to reply directly to the Deputy in relation to the questions posed.

[46958/19] ",
        "answerText": " Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection  The Social Welfare and Pensions Act 2011 provided that the State pension age would increase to age 67 years in 2021 and 68 years in 2028.  The reason for these changes was to make the State pension system more sustainable as life expectancy increases.  This is essential, as people who are working now and whose PRSI contributions fund State pension payments will need a State pension when the time comes for them to retire.  This demographic change has significant implications for the future costs of the State's pension provision, which are increasing by approximately €1 billion every four to five years.  Social welfare legislation states that jobseeker's payments may be made until a person reaches pensionable age.  The legislation also provides that the definition of \"pensionable age\" will increase as the State pension age increases so that the duration of jobseeker's payments will naturally adjust in line with increases in the State pension age.  A person who retires before reaching pension age may qualify for social insurance contribution-based jobseeker's benefit or the means-tested jobseekers allowance if they satisfy the rules of the schemes.  Currently, people on jobseekers benefit whose benefit expires on their 65th birthday can generally continue to receive benefits until they reach the pensionable age of 66 years provided that they have paid at least 156 PRSI contribution weeks.  There is no statutory retirement age in Ireland and the age at which employees retire is determined by the employment contract between the employer and the employee.  Many such contracts may have been entered into when the retirement age was 65 years and this was in the context of previous State pension arrangements.  Employers are legally entitled to increase the duration of the employee's employment for either one or two years, depending on when he or she plans to retire, if both parties agree.  The Workplace Relations Commission has produced a code of practice on longer working hours and The Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission has also published guidance material for employees and employers who use fixed-term contracts beyond what was the normal retirement age of 65 years.  People are living longer and healthier lives and many of them want to continue working after 65 and these resources can facilitate them in their choice.  I trust this clarifies the matter for the Deputy. ",

        "answerText": " Minister of State at the Department of Justice and Equality  The Disability (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill 2016 provides for a number of legislative reforms within the framework of the United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities. When Dáil Committee took place on the Bill on 30 January 2019, a number of amendments were agreed which had previously been ruled out of order by the Ceann Comhairle thus giving rise to a procedural matter. Work is ongoing to resolve this issue.  Work is also being undertaken to prepare further legislative amendments that would be tabled at Dáil Report Stage, including removing references to ‘persons of unsound mind’ from key statutes as such terminology is not considered to be in compliance with the UN Convention.
