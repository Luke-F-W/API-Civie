        "answerText": " Minister for Children, Disability and Equality  I propose to take Questions Nos. 851, 852, 853, 854 and 855 together.  Under the Disability Act, an Assessment of Need is an assessment process carried out by the HSE where a person is of the opinion that he/she may have a disability, for anyone born after 1st June 2002. It first establishes whether the person has a disability (as defined within the Act). It then identifies the health and education needs of the person with a disability and the services required to meet those needs.  On December 9th, Government announced a series of reforms to the Assessment of Need process which will make the process more effective and efficient for children and families. These reforms include changes to Part 2 of the Disability Act, 2005, which provides for Assessments of Need. The General Scheme of the Disability (Amendment) Bill 2025 was approved by Government on 9 December and will be published on the Department’s website shortly. As part of the development of the General Scheme, a Regulatory Impact Assessment was prepared, and this will also be published.  These changes will not remove any rights for parents to apply for an Assessment of Need for their child, nor will they alter the statutory six-month timeline set out in the Disability Act.  The Department is currently at an early stage of the legislative process. It is expected that the General Scheme will undergo pre-legislative scrutiny by the Oireachtas Committee on Disability Matters early in the New Year. As the Deputy is aware, the Committee may invite stakeholders to participate and produce a report with recommendations to the Bill based on its scrutiny.  In tandem with this, officials in the Department will be conducting stakeholder engagement sessions with a range of groups, the first of which is scheduled to take place this week. This will build on previous engagement by the Department with the Department of Education and Youth, the National Council for Special Education, the HSE and the National Clinical Programme for People with Disability.  It is also important to note that the work on the proposed changes to Part 2 of the Disability Act was informed by inputs from stakeholders during the development of the National Human Rights Strategy for Disabled People and by the review of the Interim Guidance for the HSE Assessment of Need Standard Operating Procedure, undertaken by the National Clinical Programme for People with Disability (NCPPD). The latter was supported by a multistakeholder Task Group who contributed to the evidence base for changes.  Ensuring that there are sufficient resources allocated to the delivery of the Assessment of Need process, both in terms of staffing and financial resources, continues to be focus for the Department and the HSE. This includes a number of measures:  • The Assessment of Need Targeted Waitlist Initiative was introduced in May 2024 to support the delivery of Assessments of Need to those families who have been waiting longest. Under this Initiative, the HSE provides for the procurement of clinical assessments from approved private providers. Recent HSE data shows that over 6,300 clinical assessments have been commissioned from private providers since the Initiative started in June 2024. Budget 2026 provides for the continuation of this Initiative next year with €20 million provided for the delivery of some 6,000 clinical assessments.  • In 2026, the HSE is also establishing eleven new teams, initially, to support HSE assessment processes, including Assessments of Need. Each team will include a psychologist, a speech and language therapist, an occupational therapist, and an administrator, to provide clinical guidance where required throughout the process.  • Work is ongoing to increase the staffing capacity of the HSE Assessment of Need Teams including assessment officers, liaison officers and administrative supports.  An Assessment of Need (AON) is not required to access health services, including Primary Care, Children’s Disability Network Teams, or Mental Health Services. When a person is receiving health services, the aim is to provide a diagnosis as soon as possible where this is required and/or possible. However, assessment and/or diagnosis are only one part of a continuum of support provided to the person. They should not delay the provision of therapeutic services which may meet a child’s needs. Once accessing health services, the offerings are designed flexibly to ensure they are responding to the needs as best possible.  The proposed legislative changes to the Disability Act 2005 are intended to support more effective delivery of Assessments of Need, and to provide clearer guidance and supports so that the process can be made more efficient, reduce delays and allow therapists to spend more time delivering services.  Key features of the bill are to include:  • An increased focus on the identification of a person’s needs and the services to meet those needs, rather than on the nature of their disability.  • The creation of statutory guidelines to support and enhance the decision-making capacity of HSE assessment officers, who are responsible for the production of assessment of need reports.  • A focus on the use of appropriate and proportionate clinical assessment(s) during the assessment of need process to ensure that they should only be used where required to establish the child’s needs.  In conjunction with these changes, operational measures are being introduced to not only improve access to assessments but also ensure that therapies are being delivered sooner:  • The HSE is putting in place a new autism assessment process from February 2026, which should provide faster access to an autism assessment for families than through the Assessment of Need process.  • The implementation of a Single Point of Access in 2026 by the HSE which will ensure that children are referred to the appropriate service that meets their needs as soon as possible.  The provision of an effective and efficient Assessment of Need system and the provision of services to children as early as possible continue to be priorities for the Government. ",

Recent HSE data shows that over 6,300 clinical assessments have been commissioned from private providers since the Initiative started in June 2024. Budget 2026 provides for the continuation of this Initiative next year with €20 million provided for the delivery of some 6,000 clinical assessments.  • In 2026, the HSE is also establishing eleven new teams, initially, to support HSE assessment processes, including Assessments of Need. Each team will include a psychologist, a speech and language therapist, an occupational therapist, and an administrator, to provide clinical guidance where required throughout the process.  • Work is ongoing to increase the staffing capacity of the HSE Assessment of Need Teams including assessment officers, liaison officers and administrative supports.  An Assessment of Need (AON) is not required to access health services, including Primary Care, Children’s Disability Network Teams, or Mental Health Services. When a person is receiving health services, the aim is to provide a diagnosis as soon as possible where this is required and/or possible. However, assessment and/or diagnosis are only one part of a continuum of support provided to the person. They should not delay the provision of therapeutic services which may meet a child’s needs. Once accessing health services, the offerings are designed flexibly to ensure they are responding to the needs as best possible.  The proposed legislative changes to the Disability Act 2005 are intended to support more effective delivery of Assessments of Need, and to provide clearer guidance and supports so that the process can be made more efficient, reduce delays and allow therapists to spend more time delivering services.  Key features of the bill are to include:  • An increased focus on the identification of a person’s needs and the services to meet those needs, rather than on the nature of their disability.  • The creation of statutory guidelines to support and enhance the decision-making capacity of HSE assessment officers, who are responsible for the production of assessment of need reports.  • A focus on the use of appropriate and proportionate clinical assessment(s) during the assessment of need process to ensure that they should only be used where required to establish the child’s needs.  In conjunction with these changes, operational measures are being introduced to not only improve access to assessments but also ensure that therapies are being delivered sooner:  • The HSE is putting in place a new autism assessment process from February 2026, which should provide faster access to an autism assessment for families than through the Assessment of Need process.  • The implementation of a Single Point of Access in 2026 by the HSE which will ensure that children are referred to the appropriate service that meets their needs as soon as possible.  The provision of an effective and efficient Assessment of Need system and the provision of services to children as early as possible continue to be priorities for the Government. ",

        "answerText": " Minister for Children, Disability and Equality  I propose to take Questions Nos. 851, 852, 853, 854 and 855 together.  Under the Disability Act, an Assessment of Need is an assessment process carried out by the HSE where a person is of the opinion that he/she may have a disability, for anyone born after 1st June 2002. It first establishes whether the person has a disability (as defined within the Act). It then identifies the health and education needs of the person with a disability and the services required to meet those needs.  On December 9th, Government announced a series of reforms to the Assessment of Need process which will make the process more effective and efficient for children and families. These reforms include changes to Part 2 of the Disability Act, 2005, which provides for Assessments of Need. The General Scheme of the Disability (Amendment) Bill 2025 was approved by Government on 9 December and will be published on the Department’s website shortly. As part of the development of the General Scheme, a Regulatory Impact Assessment was prepared, and this will also be published.  These changes will not remove any rights for parents to apply for an Assessment of Need for their child, nor will they alter the statutory six-month timeline set out in the Disability Act.  The Department is currently at an early stage of the legislative process. It is expected that the General Scheme will undergo pre-legislative scrutiny by the Oireachtas Committee on Disability Matters early in the New Year. As the Deputy is aware, the Committee may invite stakeholders to participate and produce a report with recommendations to the Bill based on its scrutiny.  In tandem with this, officials in the Department will be conducting stakeholder engagement sessions with a range of groups, the first of which is scheduled to take place this week. This will build on previous engagement by the Department with the Department of Education and Youth, the National Council for Special Education, the HSE and the National Clinical Programme for People with Disability.  It is also important to note that the work on the proposed changes to Part 2 of the Disability Act was informed by inputs from stakeholders during the development of the National Human Rights Strategy for Disabled People and by the review of the Interim Guidance for the HSE Assessment of Need Standard Operating Procedure, undertaken by the National Clinical Programme for People with Disability (NCPPD). The latter was supported by a multistakeholder Task Group who contributed to the evidence base for changes.  Ensuring that there are sufficient resources allocated to the delivery of the Assessment of Need process, both in terms of staffing and financial resources, continues to be focus for the Department and the HSE. This includes a number of measures:  • The Assessment of Need Targeted Waitlist Initiative was introduced in May 2024 to support the delivery of Assessments of Need to those families who have been waiting longest.

Qualification for Blind Pension is not based on the eye condition that one has, rather it is based on the level of vision a person has. To qualify, a person’s best vision must be equal to or less than 6/60 in the better eye or, if the field of vision is limited, the widest diameter of vision must subtend an angle of not greater than 20 degrees.  A person applying for Blind Pension must include a medical report from an ophthalmic surgeon or an optometrist with their application. This medical report is then reviewed by my Department's Medical Review Assessment Service.  If a person's level of vision meets that threshold, they will qualify for Blind Pension, provided all other conditions of the scheme are met.  I trust this clarifies the position for the Deputy. ",

An extensive process of consultation has already been put in place which has already gathered the views of stakeholders and communities across the country on what matters most for rural Ireland and its people.  This consultation commenced in March with an online public survey, followed by a series of eight stakeholder and public events across the country and online. The Rural Youth Assembly was consulted in September, ensuring that the voices of young people are fully considered in the policy development process.  Bilateral meetings with key stakeholders, representative groups, and public bodies have also taken place.  Informed by the extensive engagement already undertaken, and building on the progress already achieved, a consultation document setting out the proposed key themes and priorities for the new policy was published on 17 November. Written submissions are invited until 12 December.  Drafting of the new policy will reflect the feedback gathered from all elements of the consultation process.  Engagement with Departments is also well underway with respect to securing ambitious commitments for delivery under the new plan as we continue our whole-of-Government approach to this next phase of Ireland’s rural development policy.  The policy is also being informed by an OECD Review of Ireland’s rural policy framework which will be published in the new year.  Government is committed to building on the success of the current policy as we seek to secure a more sustainable and resilient future for our rural communities. ",

        "answerText": " Minister of State at the Department of Rural and Community Development  The Charities Regulator was established in October 2014 pursuant to the Charities Act 2009. It is the statutory body responsible for registering and regulating all of Ireland’s charities, with the mandate to promote good governance practice.  While the Charities Regulator is under the aegis of my department, it is fully independent in the performance of its statutory functions.  In its 2025-2027 Statement of Strategy, the Charities Regulator acknowledges the diversity within the charitable sector with some charities employing thousands of staff and others being entirely volunteer-run. In its strategy, the Charities Regulator recognises that its approach must be proportionate and appropriate to the size and capacity of the charities it is dealing with, while still upholding and respecting the laws that govern charities in Ireland.  The Charities (Amendment) Act 2024 revised and updated previously existing charity legislation and, when fully commenced, will improve the ability of the Charities Regulator to conduct its statutory functions. This will provide greater transparency, clarity and fairness in terms of the regulation of charities, leading to greater public trust and confidence in the sector. This transparency will also help smaller, volunteer-led charities as their responsibilities and obligations, and those of their trustees, will be clearer.  The Charities Regulator frequently provides information through webinars, guidance documents and templates for trustees and organisations to ensure they are fulfilling their duties and obligations. The regulator provides an FAQ document and training videos to assist charities to comply with the Charities Governance Code. The Charities Regulator also provides sample codes of conduct for volunteers and employees working with charities. ",

        "answerText": " Minister of State at the Department of Public Expenditure, Infrastructure, Public Service Reform and Digitalisation  In 2018, to establish those communities that are at risk from significant flood events, the Office of Public Works (OPW) completed the largest study of flood risk ever undertaken by the State: the Catchment-based Flood Risk Assessment and Management (CFRAM) Programme. The CFRAM Programme studied 80% of Ireland’s primary flood risk and identified solutions that can protect over 95% of that risk. Some 150 new and additional flood relief schemes were identified through this Programme.  The Government has committed €1.3 billion to the delivery of these flood relief schemes over the lifetime of the National Development Plan to 2030 to protect approximately 23,000 properties in communities that are under threat from river and coastal flood risk.  Since 2018, a phased approach to scheme delivery, in partnership with Local Authorities, has allowed the OPW to treble the number of schemes at design, planning or construction at this time to some 100 schemes. While the OPW strives to expedite and progress capital flood relief works with minimum delay, major flood relief schemes involve complex civil engineering and construction works that can impact on people's living, built and natural environment and, therefore, require lengthy planning and decision lead-in times. The OPW is piloting a new delivery model in County Donegal and County Kilkenny, which will inform the approach to delivering future Tranche 2 schemes nationally.  Since 2009, the OPW has provided funding through the Minor Flood Mitigation Works and Coastal Protection Scheme to local authorities. Under the scheme, applications are considered for projects to address localised fluvial flooding and coastal protection problems within the local authority's administrative area. The scheme applies where a flood defence solution may be readily identified and achieved within a short timeframe. The commencement and progression of any study or works for which funding is approved is administered by each local authority.  The OPW has ongoing engagement with Cork County Council to discuss the optimal means for progressing flood relief measures in their administrative area. To date, the OPW has approved funding of some €7.3m for over 55 projects in County Cork under the Minor Works Scheme. This funding includes the following approved projects for Castlemartyr, Killeagh, Mogeely, and Rathcormac:      Funding Approved      Date      Location      Description       €81,844    July 2024    Castlemartyr    Flood mitigation measures      €73,125    September 2024    Killeagh    River cleaning      €116,235    August 2025    Mogeely    Study to explore the possibility of flood mitigation measures in the catchment upstream of Mogeely      €49,899    September 2025    Rathcormac    River maintenance       €321,103                    Cork County Council is in the process of appointing a Consultant to undertake a detailed programme of surveys (including topographic, hydrographic, bathymetric, ground water, environmental and ecological surveys) to inform the hydrological and hydraulic modelling of the catchment upstream of Mogeely. This work will be important in supporting the identification of potential flood mitigation measures for the area. A tender process has to be undertaken in accordance with public procurement guidelines. The drafting of a detailed brief and tender documents is currently ongoing and nearing completion. Advertisement of the tender is anticipated to occur by the end of this year. ",

        "answerText": " Minister of State at the Department of Public Expenditure, Infrastructure, Public Service Reform and Digitalisation (Deputy Kevin Boxer Moran)  The Catchment-based Flood Risk Assessment and Management (CFRAM) Programme, the largest study of flood risk in Ireland to date, was completed by the Office of Public Works (OPW) in 2018. The 29 Flood Risk Management Plans were a key output of CFRAM, identifying proposed flood relief measures nationwide.  It is not possible to progress all 150 new and additional flood relief schemes identified by the Flood Risk Management Plans simultaneously, due to the limited availability of the required professional and specialised engineering skills in the OPW, local authorities, and in the consultancy market. However, the Government is committed to funding these projects through the €1.3bn available under the National Development Plan.  Since 2018, and working with local authorities, the OPW has trebled, to some 100, the number of flood relief schemes at design, planning or construction.  To date, the OPW has completed nine flood relief schemes in County Cork. This includes the Bandon, Clonakilty, Douglas, Dunmanway, Fermoy North, Fermoy South, Mallow North, Mallow South & West, and Skibbereen flood relief schemes. These completed schemes protect 1,750 properties from flooding.  Currently, there are ten major flood relief schemes at scoping, development and design, or construction stage in County Cork: Ballinhassig, Ballymakeera/Ballyvourney, Bantry, Blackpool, Carrigaline, Glashaboy, Lower Lee (Cork City), Macroom, Midleton, and Morrison’s Island. Once completed, these ten schemes will provide protection to a further circa 3,800 properties, with an economic benefit to the State in damages and losses avoided estimated to be in the region of €380m.  There are also nine further proposed flood relief schemes in the next phase known as Tranche 2, including Castlemartyr. As Mogeely is a short distance upstream of Castlemartyr, an existing Area of Potentially Significant Flood Risk (APSFR), the Castlemartyr APSFR has been extended to include the village of Mogeely, as well as the village of Ladysbridge.  The Minor Flood Mitigation Works and Coastal Protection Scheme (Minor Works Scheme) was introduced by the Office of Public Works (OPW) in 2009. The purpose of the scheme is to provide funding to local authorities to undertake minor flood mitigation works or studies to address localised flooding or coastal erosion problems within their administrative areas. The scheme generally applies where a solution can be readily identified and achieved in a short time frame.  To date, some €7m has been approved for projects in County Cork under the Minor Works scheme. Further details are available at https://www.floodinfo.ie/minor-works/  In September 2024, the OPW approved funding of €81,800 under the Minor Works Scheme for flood mitigation works in Castlemartyr. Works included maintenance of the river channel and the removal of overhanging/fallen trees that were obstructing the river flow. In August 2025, the OPW also approved funding of €116,200 under the Minor Works Scheme for a study to explore the possibility of flood mitigation solutions in the catchment upstream of Mogeely. Projects subject to approved funding are the responsibility of the relevant local authority to advance.  The OPW is actively engaging with delivery partners and other stakeholders on lessons learned and is piloting a new delivery model in Counties Donegal and Kilkenny to inform delivery of future Tranche 2 schemes nationally.  The OPW has ongoing engagement with Cork County Council in relation to flood risk at Mogeely, Castlemartyr, and other communities in Cork and the optimal means of implementing flood relief measures for these areas.

This includes significant investment in Mental Health voluntary and community organisations, which receive substantial funding from the mental health budget on a yearly basis.  The Government places significant value on the role of voluntary and community organisations in mental health services in Ireland.  Over €110 million annually is provided to over 165 national or local organisations that provide valuable mental health services or supports. This includes organisations such as Mental Health Reform, Jigsaw, Pieta, Mental Health Ireland, SHINE and many other smaller local organisations doing vital work in their communities.  Funding to voluntary and community organisations is arranged through the section 39 process via local HSE Mental Health Services, once necessary criteria are met and where a need has been identified.  All such organisations must make an application for Section 39 funding, which is then assessed by local HSE Mental Health Services and will be advanced or not depending on a variety of conditions, such as the organisation supplying the required information, local operational and clinical considerations, and HSE budgetary constraints.  In any negotiations between HSE and any charity or organisation, information such as audited accounts, governance arrangements and independent board of directors details are required, so that HSE can undertake necessary due diligence. Local HSE are always available to provide guidance to any organisation on the necessary work to comply with the requirements ahead of consideration of HSE funding of their organisation.  Prior to any funding arrangement, the HSE will need full and complete details on the corporate governance of an organisation, such as information on the board responsible for independent oversight of the management of an organisation, along with an organisation's annual financial statements which comply with the most recent statutory deadlines, as well as details of what clinical governance structures are in place, if relevant.  These are essential and appropriate steps on the road to providing funding to any organisation. They are the same requirements of all bodies to whom the State provides public funding.  With regard to the specific organisation raised in your request, the HSE are best placed to advise on potential funding, and I have asked the HSE to reply directly to the Deputy. ",

In order to ensure new special classes can open as quickly as possible the NCSE prioritise working with medium and larger primary schools who do not already have a special class and have available accommodation to accommodate new special class. This approach maximises the use of existing space which can be reconfigured efficiently while also ensuring that new provision continues to be established. It also increases the number of schools with special classes providing parents with greater choice and reducing the distances that some children are travelling to access a special class place.  However, as in other years where schools have no available accommodation, particularly at post-primary level and there is known demand in a local area, my department will continue to provide additional classroom accommodation to provide necessary places.  In order to support the NCSE and forward planning my department published Circular 0039/2025. This circular informs school management and patrons of measures introduced to support forward planning and reiterates the need for parents to inform the NCSE that they are seeking a special educational placement for their child. An earlier date of 1 October was set for parents to do so.  This notification process will provide the NCSE with valuable information as to which children will continue to require a special class as they progress to post-primary level and details on students who require a place for the first time.  The earlier date will allow for earlier sanctioning of classes for the 2026/27 school year, and it is the aim of the NCSE to sanction the majority of new special classes by 31 December 2025.  The NCSE will have a clear picture of the local demand for special class places for the 2026/27 school year after they review and assess all of the information which has been provided through the parents' notification process which closed on 1 October.  Once the NCSE has fully collated and assessed this information, the NCSE will be in a position to engage with schools across the country to open new special classes. The NCSE will also have due regard to any vacant places in existing special classes in an area and any places that will become available through the normal movement of children leaving primary or post-primary school.  I would like to stress that the NCSE will continue to support all children made known to them after the October deadline also, however, it is important for planning purposes that we set an earlier timeframe for which the NCSE has as much local knowledge and detail as possible in order to plan what new provision is required.

        "answerText": " Minister for Education and Youth  The purpose of the Climate Action Summer Works Scheme (CASWS) is to enable individual school authorities to undertake small-scale building works on a devolved basis and, ideally, can be carried out during the summer months or at other times that avoid disrupting the operation of the school. The CASWS operates on a multi-annual basis across a number of categories of works such as Climate Action and External works which could involve set down areas and carparking.  My department can confirm that an application under the CASWS has been received for the school in question. However, it should be noted that applications will be assessed in accordance with availability of funding.  It is envisaged that approvals in any given year will involve a spread of categories rather than the traditional single category at a time. This is aimed at managing market capacity and maximising value for money opportunities for school authorities.  The CASWS will operate on a multi-annual basis with the first tranche of projects being announced in Q4 2025 for commencement in summer 2026. Under this scheme, approved applications from schools that are not reached for funding or market prioritisation reasons (as above) in 2026 will qualify to be assessed for purposes of the funding available for climate action summer works in subsequent years.  Full details of the new CASWS, Circular (0029/2025) for the scheme and guidance documents for schools can be found at the below link: (www.gov.ie/en/department-of-education/services/summer-works-scheme/).

        "answerText": " Minister of State at the Department of Education and Youth  Budget 2026 has provided funding for 3,000 new special educational places within our education system and the National Council for Special Education (NCSE) is currently examining where this provision is best placed for the 2026/27 school year.  In order to ensure new special classes can open as quickly as possible the NCSE prioritise working with medium and larger primary schools who do not already have a special class and have available accommodation to accommodate new special class. This approach maximises the use of existing space which can be reconfigured efficiently while also ensuring that new provision continues to be established. It also increases the number of schools with special classes providing parents with greater choice and reducing the distances that some children are travelling to access a special class place.  However, as in other years where schools have no available accommodation, particularly at post-primary level and there is known demand in a local area, my department will continue to provide additional classroom accommodation to provide necessary places.  In order to support the NCSE and forward planning my department published Circular 0039/2025. This circular informs school management and patrons of measures introduced to support forward planning and reiterates the need for parents to inform the NCSE that they are seeking a special educational placement for their child. An earlier date of 1 October was set for parents to do so.  This notification process will provide the NCSE with valuable information as to which children will continue to require a special class as they progress to post-primary level and details on students who require a place for the first time.  The earlier date will allow for earlier sanctioning of classes for the 2026/27 school year, and it is the aim of the NCSE to sanction the majority of new special classes by 31 December 2025.  The NCSE will have a clear picture of the local demand for special class places for the 2026/27 school year after they review and assess all of the information which has been provided through the parents' notification process which closed on 1 October.  Once the NCSE has fully collated and assessed this information, the NCSE will be in a position to engage with schools across the country to open new special classes. The NCSE will also have due regard to any vacant places in existing special classes in an area and any places that will become available through the normal movement of children leaving primary or post-primary school.  I would like to stress that the NCSE will continue to support all children made known to them after the October deadline also, however, it is important for planning purposes that we set an earlier timeframe for which the NCSE has as much local knowledge and detail as possible in order to plan what new provision is required.

        "answerText": " Minister for Social Protection  Illness benefit is the primary short term income support provided by my Department to those who are unable to work due to illness of any type and who are covered by social insurance.  Eligibility for illness benefit depends on the person’s PRSI record and class.  People must have made the required number of contributions under PRSI classes A, E, H or P to qualify.  A key feature of the social insurance system is the requirement to maintain a balance between coverage for various contingencies, such as illness benefit, with the sustainability of the Social Insurance Fund.  Given that illness benefit may be paid for a maximum duration of two years, subject to the other scheme conditions being met, the current contribution requirements and graduation of payment rates are considered to be proportionate and appropriate.  The Programme for Government includes an action \"Introduce Pay-Related Parent's Benefit and explore other payments where a similar model could be applied.\"  My Department recently introduced jobseeker’s pay-related benefit and the experience from this scheme as it continues to roll out will help inform the considerations around the extension of a pay-related approach for other benefits.  The initial focus is on parent’s benefit and work is ongoing within the Department.  My Department will continue to keep its range of supports under review to ensure that they meet their overall objectives.  Any changes to the current system would need to be considered in an overall policy and budgetary context.  I trust this clarifies matters for the Deputy. ",

        "answerText": " Minister of State at the Department of Public Expenditure, Infrastructure, Public Service Reform and Digitalisation  The launch in 2018 of the Flood Risk Management Plans trebled, to some 100, the number of flood relief schemes at design and construction. There remains some 50 schemes, referred to as Tranche II, yet to commence work on their design, due to constraints of professional engineering services and skills in Ireland. However, the Government is committed to funding these projects through the €1.3bn available under the National Development Plan for flood relief measures.  To ensure the safeguarding of the people of Midleton and East Cork,  Cork County Council is leading the delivery of six flood relief schemes, including Midleton, with nine Tranche II schemes, including Castlemartyr, Youghal and Rathcormac. The Office of Public Works, (OPW), is funding nine staff in Cork County Council to support its delivery of this programme of schemes, and other schemes across the county including in Mogeely and Killeagh. Four of these staff are working full time on the Midleton Flood Relief Scheme.  The OPW is piloting a new delivery model in Counties Donegal and Kilkenny to inform delivery of future Tranche II schemes nationally.  The Midleton Flood Relief Scheme, to protect up to 750 properties is currently estimated to be submitted to An Coimisiún Pleanála under the Planning and Development Acts in Q2 2026 and for substantial completion in 2031.  Cork County Council is engaging with landowners, whose lands have been identified as needed for the scheme. Work is ongoing on environmental surveys and assessments which are required to inform the Environmental Impact Assessment Report. Cork County Council, in June 2025, submitted the Marine Area Consent Application to the Maritime Area Regulatory Authority (MARA).  Many interim measures have been introduced across Midleton and East Cork following Storm Babet in October 2023, including river cleaning.  A part 8 planning application for advance works at Tir Cluain, to protect up to 135 properties has been published by Cork County Council and is available to the public online and at the Planning Department, Cork County Hall and at Cork County Council East Cork Municipal District Offices at Midleton Lodge and Mall House, Youghal with submissions/observations to be made before 4pm on 11th November 2025. A public information evening on these planned works took place on 23rd October 2025. Subject to a successful planning application construction works are planned to commence in late summer/early autumn 2026.  In October 2024, the OPW approved €5.8m in funding for Cork County Council to make Individual Property Protection available free of charge to some 725 homes and businesses in Midleton and across East Cork who were impacted by Storm Babet in October 2023. This forms part of the Council’s emergency response plans for these areas. The scheme requires some 2,000 flood barriers and a significant number of these need civil works to have them installed. The Council is continuing to procure flood gates and civil works contractors to deliver the scale of this programme as quickly as possible. Cork County Council and the OPW is keeping the delivery of this IPP scheme under review.  A quarterly update by Cork County Council on the Midleton Flood Relief Scheme and the Individual Property Protection scheme was presented at the Midleton Flood Committee meeting on 9th October 2025 and the next update is scheduled for 22nd January 2026. This Committee consists of local elected representatives, members of the business community and the wider community.  The Minor Flood Mitigation works and Coastal Protection Scheme (Minor Works Scheme) was introduced by the OPW in 2009. The purpose of this scheme is to provide funding to Local Authorities to undertake short-term measures in the form of minor flood mitigation works to address localised fluvial flooding and coastal protection problems within their administrative area. The scheme applies, where a flood defence solution can be readily identified and achieved within a relatively short timeframe, whilst all works must comply with relevant regulatory frameworks. This is a demand led scheme, led by applications from the local authorities and is not restricted by budgetary constraints.

It is an organisation that operates in a very challenging and demand led environment, providing vital services to children, young people and families during difficult times in their lives and sometimes involving very complex needs.  Tusla saw 96,666 child protection and welfare referrals in 2024: a 5% increase on 2023 (91,924) and is expecting to have in excess of 100,000 referrals this year.  Tusla activity is already subject to extensive external review in relation to service provision, by regulatory authorities including the Ombudsman, Children's Ombudsman, Comptroller and Auditor General and the Health Information and Quality Authority (HIQA) and the independent National Review Panel.  As a publicly funded body, Tusla’s performance, spending and reform progress are monitored by The Department of Children, Disability and Equality and this process informs regular engagement with the Tusla Board.  This Department continues to support Tusla in carrying out its functions. In successive, recent Budgets, Tusla has received significant increases in funding, bringing its total overall budget to over €1.3 billion. I am committed to ensuring the continuity of support for vulnerable children as can be witnessed in the year on year increase in the funding provided to Tusla.  I have no plans currently, to conduct an independent external review of Tusla’s structure, oversight and funding. This Department keeps the governance and funding of Tusla under ongoing review. It has established processes in place to support the governance and oversight of Tusla so that its actions are aligned with the priorities and the goals in the Department’s Statement of Strategy.  These priorities and the Department’s Statement of Strategy in turn are derived from the Programme for Government. The Programme for Government makes a range of commitments that are supportive of the work of Tusla. ",

        "answerText": " Minister for Children, Disability and Equality  Young people who have had a care history with Tusla are entitled to an aftercare service based on their eligibility and assessed needs. This assessment considers a number of factors including the young person’s educational and accommodation needs.  Upon reaching the age of 18, a young person is deemed to have left State care. All eligible care leavers are supported through aftercare services provided by Tusla. Care leavers, depending on need, may be allocated an aftercare worker. All care leavers, without exception or age limit, can attend drop-in services organised by the Tusla aftercare service.  The Child Care Act 1991, as amended, sets out that where Tusla is providing assistance to a person in accordance with an aftercare plan by arranging for the completion of education and by contributing to maintenance while completing education, and that person attains the age of 21 years, Tusla may continue to provide that assistance until the completion of the course of education or the end of the academic year during which the person attains the age of 23, whichever is the earlier.  Tusla provides financial support to eligible care leavers who are engaged in a qualifying educational course or training programme. The aftercare allowance amounts to €300 per week and is dependent on the eligible young adult attending an accredited education course, third level course or training programme as outlined in the young adult’s Aftercare Plan. The allowance is provided to cover a young adult's day to day costs, including accommodation as they progress in their chosen accredited course or training program.  Collaboration across Government is also essential in improving the lived experiences of our young people leaving care. This cross governmental approach was clearly evident in the recently revised and updated Protocol on Young People Leaving Care. Through successful engagement between officials in the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage and their colleagues in the Department of Children, Disability and Equality, the revised Protocol ensures consistent housing and support for young people leaving State care. The Protocol also outlines clearly defined procedures for Housing Authorities and Tusla in managing the assessment of these young people and their housing needs.  My Department will continue to engage with and support Tusla in improving aftercare services for care leavers. ",

All reports are available at [ www.fisheriesireland.ie/publications ].

A summary report has also been published by the Group which provides a clear account of the response to, and the investigation into, the incident.  My priority now is to learn from this event and to ensure that we are better prepared to prevent and respond to such incidents in the future. I have written to the Board of Inland Fisheries Ireland (IF), asking IFI to lead an independent review on behalf of the Inter-Agency Group. The purpose of this review would be to consider the actions taken during the Blackwater incident, assess their effectiveness and make recommendations on how prevention and response measures can be improved.

        "answerText": " Minister of State at the Department of Public Expenditure, Infrastructure, Public Service Reform and Digitalisation  I propose to take Questions Nos. 332 and 333 together.  The Catchment-based Flood Risk Assessment and Management (CFRAM) Programme, the largest study of flood risk ever undertaken by the State, was completed by the Office of Public Works (OPW) in 2018. The CFRAM programme studied 80% of Ireland's primary flood risk and identified measures to protect over 95% of that risk. The 29 Flood Risk Management Plans were a key output of CFRAM, identifying proposed flood relief measures nationwide. The Government is committed to funding these projects through the €1.3bn available under the National Development Plan.  It is not possible to progress all 150 new and additional flood relief schemes identified by the Flood Risk Management Plans simultaneously, due to the limited availability of the required professional and specialised engineering skills in the OPW, local authorities, and in the consultancy market. Since 2018, and working with local authorities, the OPW has trebled, to some 100, the number of flood relief schemes at design, planning or construction in Tranche 1.  To date, the OPW has completed nine flood relief schemes in County Cork. This includes the Bandon, Clonakilty, Douglas, Dunmanway, Fermoy North, Fermoy South, Mallow North, Mallow South & West, and Skibbereen flood relief schemes. These completed schemes protect 1,750 properties from flooding.  Currently, there are ten major flood relief schemes at development and design or construction stage in County Cork: Ballinhassig, Ballymakeera/Ballyvourney, Bantry, Blackpool, Carrigaline, Glashaboy, Cork City (Lower Lee), Macroom, Midleton, and Morrison’s Island. Once completed, these ten projects will provide protection to a further circa 3,800 properties. The OPW is funding nine engineering staff in Cork County Council to support its delivery of flood relief schemes.  Under the national programme, work has yet to commence on some 50 Tranche 2 flood relief schemes. Planning for the delivery of these schemes has commenced through the Tranche 2 Pilot. Ultimately, the Pilot will inform the delivery model to be applied for the future tranche of schemes and, in doing so, will be relevant to all schemes nationwide. There are a further nine proposed flood relief schemes in Tranche 2 throughout County Cork, including Castlemartyr.  As Mogeely is a short distance upstream of Castlemartyr, an existing Area of Potentially Significant Flood Risk (APSFR), the Castlemartyr APSFR has been extended to include the village of Mogeely and the village of Ladysbridge, to provide for an efficient assessment of the risk and potential mitigation options for the three communities together.  The Minor Flood Mitigation Works and Coastal Protection Scheme (Minor Works Scheme) was introduced by the Office of Public Works (OPW) in 2009. The purpose of the scheme is to provide funding to local authorities to undertake minor flood mitigation works or studies to address localised flooding or coastal erosion problems within their administrative areas. The scheme generally applies where a solution can be readily identified and achieved in a short time frame. Applications for funding from local authorities are assessed by the OPW having regard to the specific economic, technical, social and environmental criteria of the scheme, including a cost-benefit ratio.  I recently announced that an increase in funding supports are to be made available to local authorities under the Minor Works Scheme, including an increase in the upper Minor Works threshold from €750,000 to €2,000,000. Details of these revisions to the Scheme are to be made available to local authorities over the coming weeks.  To date, some €7m has been approved for over 50 projects in County Cork under the Minor Works scheme. Further details are available at www.floodinfo.ie/minor-works/.  In September 2024, the OPW approved funding of €81,800 under the aforementioned Scheme for flood mitigation works in Castlemartyr. Works included maintenance of the river channel and the removal of overhanging/fallen trees that were obstructing the flow. In August 2025, the OPW also approved funding of €116,235 under the Minor Works Scheme for a study to explore the possibility of flood mitigation solutions in the catchment upstream of Mogeely. Projects subject to approved funding are the responsibility of the relevant local authority to advance.  The OPW has ongoing engagement with Cork County Council in relation to flood risk at Mogeely, Castlemartyr, and other communities and the optimal means of implementing flood relief measures for these areas.

        "answerText": " Minister of State at the Department of Public Expenditure, Infrastructure, Public Service Reform and Digitalisation  I propose to take Questions Nos. 332 and 333 together.  The Catchment-based Flood Risk Assessment and Management (CFRAM) Programme, the largest study of flood risk ever undertaken by the State, was completed by the Office of Public Works (OPW) in 2018. The CFRAM programme studied 80% of Ireland's primary flood risk and identified measures to protect over 95% of that risk. The 29 Flood Risk Management Plans were a key output of CFRAM, identifying proposed flood relief measures nationwide. The Government is committed to funding these projects through the €1.3bn available under the National Development Plan.  It is not possible to progress all 150 new and additional flood relief schemes identified by the Flood Risk Management Plans simultaneously, due to the limited availability of the required professional and specialised engineering skills in the OPW, local authorities, and in the consultancy market. Since 2018, and working with local authorities, the OPW has trebled, to some 100, the number of flood relief schemes at design, planning or construction in Tranche 1.  To date, the OPW has completed nine flood relief schemes in County Cork. This includes the Bandon, Clonakilty, Douglas, Dunmanway, Fermoy North, Fermoy South, Mallow North, Mallow South & West, and Skibbereen flood relief schemes. These completed schemes protect 1,750 properties from flooding.  Currently, there are ten major flood relief schemes at development and design or construction stage in County Cork: Ballinhassig, Ballymakeera/Ballyvourney, Bantry, Blackpool, Carrigaline, Glashaboy, Cork City (Lower Lee), Macroom, Midleton, and Morrison’s Island. Once completed, these ten projects will provide protection to a further circa 3,800 properties. The OPW is funding nine engineering staff in Cork County Council to support its delivery of flood relief schemes.  Under the national programme, work has yet to commence on some 50 Tranche 2 flood relief schemes. Planning for the delivery of these schemes has commenced through the Tranche 2 Pilot. Ultimately, the Pilot will inform the delivery model to be applied for the future tranche of schemes and, in doing so, will be relevant to all schemes nationwide. There are a further nine proposed flood relief schemes in Tranche 2 throughout County Cork, including Castlemartyr.  As Mogeely is a short distance upstream of Castlemartyr, an existing Area of Potentially Significant Flood Risk (APSFR), the Castlemartyr APSFR has been extended to include the village of Mogeely and the village of Ladysbridge, to provide for an efficient assessment of the risk and potential mitigation options for the three communities together.  The Minor Flood Mitigation Works and Coastal Protection Scheme (Minor Works Scheme) was introduced by the Office of Public Works (OPW) in 2009. The purpose of the scheme is to provide funding to local authorities to undertake minor flood mitigation works or studies to address localised flooding or coastal erosion problems within their administrative areas. The scheme generally applies where a solution can be readily identified and achieved in a short time frame. Applications for funding from local authorities are assessed by the OPW having regard to the specific economic, technical, social and environmental criteria of the scheme, including a cost-benefit ratio.  I recently announced that an increase in funding supports are to be made available to local authorities under the Minor Works Scheme, including an increase in the upper Minor Works threshold from €750,000 to €2,000,000. Details of these revisions to the Scheme are to be made available to local authorities over the coming weeks.  To date, some €7m has been approved for over 50 projects in County Cork under the Minor Works scheme. Further details are available at www.floodinfo.ie/minor-works/.  In September 2024, the OPW approved funding of €81,800 under the aforementioned Scheme for flood mitigation works in Castlemartyr. Works included maintenance of the river channel and the removal of overhanging/fallen trees that were obstructing the flow. In August 2025, the OPW also approved funding of €116,235 under the Minor Works Scheme for a study to explore the possibility of flood mitigation solutions in the catchment upstream of Mogeely. Projects subject to approved funding are the responsibility of the relevant local authority to advance.  The OPW has ongoing engagement with Cork County Council in relation to flood risk at Mogeely, Castlemartyr, and other communities and the optimal means of implementing flood relief measures for these areas.

        "answerText": " Minister for Education and Youth  As the Deputy is aware, in December 2024 my Department announced €12m in funding for a Science Implementation Support Grant to support schools with the rollout of the revised science subjects in the 2025/2026 school year.  This grant was paid to all schools in the Free Education Scheme with a minimum base payment of €13,000 up to a maximum of €24,200 based on four bands of enrolment with a further 10% uplift for DEIS schools. This means that DEIS schools received an additional 10% on top of the base payment for their enrolment band which was in line with previous applications of a DEIS uplift in Departmental funding models, including the grant for ICT infrastructure.  The grant was paid to all schools in the Free Education Scheme in line with the approach taken by the Department in regard to a number of funding streams for schools such as the Post-primary Schoolbooks Scheme. This approach was communicated to schools from the outset in the Science Implementation Support Grant Guidelines for Post-primary Schools published on 3 December 2024. As the school referred to by the Deputy is a fee-charging school outside of the Free Education Scheme, it was not eligible to avail of the Science Implementation Support Grant. This approach was clarified to the school in question through direct correspondence with them in January 2025.  Grants such as the Science Implementation Support Grant are provided to schools in the Free Education Scheme as these schools are not able to derive an income from the charging of fees. Outside of teacher salaries, which are paid directly by my Department, per capita grants such as the Science Implementation Support Grant are the main source of income for schools in the Free Education Scheme.  Oide, the support service for teachers, is continuing to provide a comprehensive suite of professional learning events to support the implementation of new science specifications as part of senior cycle redevelopment, including dedicated supports aimed at school leaders, full day professional learning experiences for all staff in schools, subject specific full-day cluster workshops for teachers, as well as a wide range of elective events and classroom materials and resources. All post-primary schools can avail of this professional learning. ",

        "answerText": " Minister for Education and Youth  I propose to take Questions Nos. 381, 382 and 391 together.  The Education (Admission to Schools) Act 2018 (The Act) provides a framework for school enrolment that is designed to ensure that every child is treated fairly and that the way in which schools decide on applications for admission is structured, fair and transparent. The Act provides that in schools, where there are places available, the school must admit each student applying. The Act prohibits the use of religion as a selection criterion in primary school admissions.  The Act provides a protection to ensure that a child of a minority faith, can access a school of their faith. This provision allows schools of a minority faith ethos to admit as a priority a student from a minority religion. The priority can only be applied where a pupil is seeking admission to a school that provides religious instruction or religious education consistent with their minority religious beliefs or a religion similar to their religious beliefs.  The pupil teacher ratio in Ireland is currently 19:1 for schools in the free education system and 23:1 in the fee-charging system.   Capitation Grant  The Government is committed to increasing funding to support schools in the Free Education Scheme, and the Programme for Government commits to increasing capitation funding to schools of all types to ensure that schools can meet the elevated day-to-day running costs.  My Department is committed to providing funding to recognised primary and post-primary schools in the Free Education Scheme by way of per capita grants. The two main grants are the capitation grant to cater for day-to-day running costs such as heating, lighting, cleaning, insurance and general up-keep, and the ancillary grant to cater for the cost of employing ancillary services staff.  The commitment in the Programme for Government builds on the progress which has been made in recent years. As part of the capitation package in Budget 2026, I am pleased that a total of €39m was secured for a permanent increase in mainstream capitation grant funding for schools, increasing the mainstream rate of capitation to €274 per pupil in primary schools and to €406 in post-primary schools for the 2026/2027 school year. Over the last three Budgets this has resulted in an increase in the level of capitation rates of 49.7% (€91) paid to primary schools and 28.5% (€90) paid to post-primary schools. This will also allow for an increase of €20 in capitation rates for Urban Band One DEIS primary schools, increasing the mainstream pupil rate in these schools to €294. The increased capitation rates will also see special schools now receive the same rates of capitation for young people aged 12 and over, as their peers in mainstream post-primary schools.  The current standard rate of capitation grant is €224 per pupil in primary schools and €386 per student in post-primary schools. Primary schools with fewer than 60 pupils are paid the capitation and the ancillary grants on the basis of having 60 pupils. Enhanced rates are also paid in respect of pupils with special educational needs and Traveller pupils.  These supports are made available to all recognised primary and post-primary schools in the Free Education Scheme. Fee-charging schools do not receive capitation or ancillary grants from my Department. What differentiates fee-charging schools from all other post-primary schools is the capacity to raise funds through mandatory fees, while in receipt of exchequer funding. The fees charged are mandatory in that initial admission to the fee-charging school or ongoing participation is contingent on the payment of fees.   Schoolbooks Scheme  The funding provided under the schoolbooks schemes is specifically to provide free schoolbooks for some 940,000 children and young people in recognised primary and post-primary schools in the Free Education Scheme from the start of the 2025/26 school year.  Private fee-charging schools are not in the Free Education Scheme and are not included in the schoolbooks scheme.  ICT Grant  The Digital Strategy for Schools to 2027 was published in 2022 and is underpinned by funding of €200m over the course of the strategy to support its implementation, which was committed to under Ireland’s National Development Plan (NDP). The criteria applying to the ICT Infrastructure Grant will be detailed in the associated circular at the time of issue of the grant. A standard funding formula incorporating both a flat rate lump sum and a per capita amount for each pupil/student enrolled has been used to calculate the grant due to each school. An enhanced per capita rate applies to pupils/students enrolled in DEIS and Special schools and to pupils in mainstream special class primary settings.  All pupils/students following primary and post-primary programmes are included, for per capita purposes, in recognised primary, special and post-primary schools. Fee-charging post-primary schools receive funding at a 50% rate.  Capital funding  Since 2020, my Department has invested over €6 billion in our schools throughout the country under the National Development Plan, involving the completion of over 1,300 school building projects. In July the Government announced a capital allocation of €7.55 billion for my Department of Education and Youth for the period 2026-2030 under the National Development Plan. My department is now preparing an NDP implementation plan which is due for publication later in the autumn. As part of this NDP allocation my Department will place a strong emphasis on provision for children with special educational needs, with a particular focus on meeting annual school place needs. My Department’s overall approach in relation to projects funded under the school building programme is to prioritise the needs of primary and post-primary schools in the Free Education Scheme.  The purpose of the Emergency Works Scheme (EWS) is to provide funding specifically for unforeseen emergencies, or to provide funding to facilitate inclusion and access for pupils with special needs. It does so by ensuring the availability of funding for urgent works to those schools that are in need of resources as a result of an emergency situation.  The purpose of the Summer Works Scheme (SWS) is to enable individual school authorities to undertake small-scale building works on a devolved basis and, ideally, can be carried out during the summer months or at other times that avoid disrupting the operation of the school. The SWS operates on a multi-annual basis for a number of categories which could include the provision or upgrade of science labs, for example.  The Climate Action Summer Works Scheme (CASWS) is open to all recognised schools that are participating in the Free Education Scheme. Earlier this year I announced details in respect of the CASWS 2026 onwards. The Summer Works Scheme was renamed to reflect the strong climate focus and is now called the Climate Action Summer Works Scheme. The CASWS has recently closed for applications and it is envisaged that approvals in any given year will involve a spread of categories rather than the traditional single category at a time.  The CASWS will operate on a multi-annual basis with the first tranche of projects being announced in Q4 2025 for commencement in summer 2026. Under this scheme, approved applications from schools that are not reached for funding or market prioritisation reasons (as above) in 2026 will qualify to be assessed for purposes of the funding available for climate action summer works in subsequent years.  Curriculum  In December 2024 my Department announced €12m in funding for a Science Implementation Support Grant to support schools with the rollout of the revised science subjects in the 2025/2026 school year. The grant was paid to all schools in the Free Education Scheme and this approach was communicated to schools from the outset in the Science Implementation Support Grant Guidelines for post-primary schools published on 3rd December 2024.  Separately, the new subjects of Drama, Film and Theatre Studies and Climate Action and Sustainable Development are now being taught in almost 100 schools. These schools were selected from those who expressed an interest in 2024 in offering the subjects. Whether a school was a fee-charging school or was in the Free Education Scheme was not a relevant criterion in their selection.  All Phase One Climate Action and Sustainable Development schools, not limited to those in the Free Education Scheme, received a once-off funding of €5,000 in September 2025 to establish a Climate Action and Sustainable Development subject department in their school.  All Phase One Drama, Film and Theatre Studies schools, not limited to those in the Free Education Scheme, have been provided with access to new streaming services, allowing registered teachers free access in the classroom to prescribed material and resources to support the new Leaving Certificate Drama, Film and Theatre Studies specification. In addition, all relevant Phase One schools are being provided with film production and audio equipment for the teaching of Leaving Certificate Drama, Film, and Theatre Studies. However, only those Phase One schools for both subjects in the free education scheme will be provided with an annual Implementation Support Grant of €50 per student in line with the general approach taken to per capita grant funding.

In July the Government announced a capital allocation of €7.55 billion for my Department of Education and Youth for the period 2026-2030 under the National Development Plan. My department is now preparing an NDP implementation plan which is due for publication later in the autumn. As part of this NDP allocation my Department will place a strong emphasis on provision for children with special educational needs, with a particular focus on meeting annual school place needs. My Department’s overall approach in relation to projects funded under the school building programme is to prioritise the needs of primary and post-primary schools in the Free Education Scheme.  The purpose of the Emergency Works Scheme (EWS) is to provide funding specifically for unforeseen emergencies, or to provide funding to facilitate inclusion and access for pupils with special needs. It does so by ensuring the availability of funding for urgent works to those schools that are in need of resources as a result of an emergency situation.  The purpose of the Summer Works Scheme (SWS) is to enable individual school authorities to undertake small-scale building works on a devolved basis and, ideally, can be carried out during the summer months or at other times that avoid disrupting the operation of the school. The SWS operates on a multi-annual basis for a number of categories which could include the provision or upgrade of science labs, for example.  The Climate Action Summer Works Scheme (CASWS) is open to all recognised schools that are participating in the Free Education Scheme. Earlier this year I announced details in respect of the CASWS 2026 onwards. The Summer Works Scheme was renamed to reflect the strong climate focus and is now called the Climate Action Summer Works Scheme. The CASWS has recently closed for applications and it is envisaged that approvals in any given year will involve a spread of categories rather than the traditional single category at a time.  The CASWS will operate on a multi-annual basis with the first tranche of projects being announced in Q4 2025 for commencement in summer 2026. Under this scheme, approved applications from schools that are not reached for funding or market prioritisation reasons (as above) in 2026 will qualify to be assessed for purposes of the funding available for climate action summer works in subsequent years.  Curriculum  In December 2024 my Department announced €12m in funding for a Science Implementation Support Grant to support schools with the rollout of the revised science subjects in the 2025/2026 school year. The grant was paid to all schools in the Free Education Scheme and this approach was communicated to schools from the outset in the Science Implementation Support Grant Guidelines for post-primary schools published on 3rd December 2024.  Separately, the new subjects of Drama, Film and Theatre Studies and Climate Action and Sustainable Development are now being taught in almost 100 schools. These schools were selected from those who expressed an interest in 2024 in offering the subjects. Whether a school was a fee-charging school or was in the Free Education Scheme was not a relevant criterion in their selection.  All Phase One Climate Action and Sustainable Development schools, not limited to those in the Free Education Scheme, received a once-off funding of €5,000 in September 2025 to establish a Climate Action and Sustainable Development subject department in their school.  All Phase One Drama, Film and Theatre Studies schools, not limited to those in the Free Education Scheme, have been provided with access to new streaming services, allowing registered teachers free access in the classroom to prescribed material and resources to support the new Leaving Certificate Drama, Film and Theatre Studies specification. In addition, all relevant Phase One schools are being provided with film production and audio equipment for the teaching of Leaving Certificate Drama, Film, and Theatre Studies. However, only those Phase One schools for both subjects in the free education scheme will be provided with an annual Implementation Support Grant of €50 per student in line with the general approach taken to per capita grant funding.

Pet theft causes huge trauma for pet owners and theft of livestock results in significant financial losses. I also appreciate the strong emotional attachment we all have to animals and that theft not only leads to their loss in our lives, but also a high level of concern for their welfare.  Prosecutions are a matter for the Director of Public Prosecutions, who is fully independent in her functions. As Minister, I have no role in the operations, functions, governance or oversight of the Office of the DPP and I am unable to provide any information or statistics relating to the Director's work as a result.  Additionally, management of the courts, along with related operational matters and logistical functions, are the responsibility of the judiciary and Courts Service, which are independent in exercising their functions under the Courts Service Act 1998 and the Constitution.  The Courts Service has a dedicated email address for the provision of information to members of the Houses of the Oireachtas: oireachtasenquiries@courts.ie.  To be of assistance to the Deputy I have sought the information requested from the Courts Service. They have informed me that it has not been possible to provide the data sought. The Courts Service have advised that there is no specific offence for the theft of an animal. Prosecutors are likely to use the offence code for theft pursuant to section 4 of the 2001 Act, which would cover all theft, not just theft of animals.

Under the Animal Health and Welfare Act 2013, it is illegal to crop the ears of a puppy or dog of any age. Ear-cropping is a cruel and unnecessary mutilation, causing the dog pain and suffering at the time the ears are cropped, and can often lead to lifelong discomfort and recurrent infections.  Statutory Instrument 412 of 2023 Ear-cropping of Dogs Regulations 2023, further strengthened the restrictions in place on the practice of ear-cropping. The Regulation came into operation on 1st September 2023 and specifically restricts the possession or control of dogs with cropped ears, the sale or supply of dogs with cropped ears, the import of dogs with cropped ears and the possession, sale or supply of equipment used to crop the ears of dogs, and prohibits the showing of dogs with cropped ears.  To date, my Department has taken 11 prosecutions, under the suit of the Minister under the Animal Health and Welfare Act, for ear-cropping offences, resulting in fines of €6,900, four prison sentences of which two were suspended and bans from keeping animals.
