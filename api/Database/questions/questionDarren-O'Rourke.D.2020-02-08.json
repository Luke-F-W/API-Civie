To address teacher supply issues, my Department has implemented several measures that have led to:  • an increase of 20% in Initial Teacher Education graduates (student teachers) between 2018 and 2023, and  • over 30% increase in the number of teachers registered with the Teaching Council since 2017.  The Department provides a range of measures to address teacher supply. The Department announced new measures in 2025 including assisting teachers gain permanent roles more quickly and approving regulations recently to allow teachers who qualified overseas to undertake their induction in the State. In addition, measures including a STEM bursary, an expansion of upskilling programmes, improving the availability of substitution and continuing promotion of teaching as a profession have been introduced.  My Department remains committed to supporting a diverse and sustainable teaching workforce and is currently developing a strategic workforce plan for the teaching profession, in partnership with UNESCO and supported by the European Commission’s Technical Support Instrument. This plan will include analysis of workforce demographics and is expected to report in mid 2026.  The Department will continue to consider further measures to strengthen the teaching workforce and ensure that schools have the support needed to provide an excellent education for every student. ",

To address teacher supply issues, my Department has implemented several measures that have led to:  • an increase of 20% in Initial Teacher Education graduates (student teachers) between 2018 and 2023, and  • over 30% increase in the number of teachers registered with the Teaching Council since 2017.  The Department provides a range of measures to address teacher supply. The Department announced new measures in 2025 including assisting teachers gain permanent roles more quickly and approving regulations recently to allow teachers who qualified overseas to undertake their induction in the State. In addition, measures including a STEM bursary, an expansion of upskilling programmes, improving the availability of substitution and continuing promotion of teaching as a profession have been introduced.  My Department remains committed to supporting a diverse and sustainable teaching workforce and is currently developing a strategic workforce plan for the teaching profession, in partnership with UNESCO and supported by the European Commission’s Technical Support Instrument. This plan will include analysis of workforce demographics and is expected to report in mid 2026.  The Department will continue to consider further measures to strengthen the teaching workforce and ensure that schools have the support needed to provide an excellent education for every student. ",

The data including the number of male and female teachers in the education system at both primary and post-primary level each year for the period 2015 to 2025 may be found on the Teacher Statistics section to the Department's website, using this link : www.gov.ie/en/department-of-education/publications/teacher-statistics/  The ratio of female to male teachers in primary and post-primary schools (Excl ETBs) in the 2024/25 school year was 6:1 and 2:1 respectively.  In addition, the Department recently published 3 reports on teacher supply including data on an analysis of the Teaching Council register, a survey of substitutes and a survey of teacher unmet demand in post-primary schools.  An analysis of teacher payroll data, as of March 2025, shows there are 79,225 teachers employed in our schools across the country with 43,221 at primary level including special schools and 36,004 in post-primary schools.  From data provided by the Department’s payroll in June 2025 for the 2024/2025 school year, there were 68,175 teachers (excluding principals) in primary and post-primary schools (excluding ETBs).     -    Number of Teachers**    % of Total number of teachers      Primary (Female)    37,757    55.38%      Primary (Male)    6,356    9.32%      Post-Primary (Female)*    16,485    24.18%      Post-Primary (Male)*    7,577    11.11%      Total    68,175         *Excludes ETB Teachers  **Excludes principals  Note: the figures in the above table are extracted from Payroll databases on 30th June each year which includes contracted and casual teachers.

To address teacher supply issues, my Department has implemented several measures that have led to:  • an increase of 20% in Initial Teacher Education graduates (student teachers) between 2018 and 2023, and  • over 30% increase in the number of teachers registered with the Teaching Council since 2017.  The Department provides a range of measures to address teacher supply. The Department announced new measures in 2025 including assisting teachers gain permanent roles more quickly and approving regulations recently to allow teachers who qualified overseas to undertake their induction in the State. In addition, measures including a STEM bursary, an expansion of upskilling programmes, improving the availability of substitution and continuing promotion of teaching as a profession have been introduced.  My Department remains committed to supporting a diverse and sustainable teaching workforce and is currently developing a strategic workforce plan for the teaching profession, in partnership with UNESCO and supported by the European Commission’s Technical Support Instrument. This plan will include analysis of workforce demographics and is expected to report in mid 2026.  The Department will continue to consider further measures to strengthen the teaching workforce and ensure that schools have the support needed to provide an excellent education for every student. ",

        "answerText": " Minister of State at the Department of Education and Youth  Enabling students with special educational needs to receive an education that meets their needs is a priority for this Government. It is also a key priority for me, my department and for the National Council for Special Education (NCSE).  The vast majority of students with special educational needs are supported to attend mainstream classes with their peers. Where students with more complex needs require additional supports, special class and special school places are provided.  This is in keeping with policy on an inclusive education, which promotes that students will be supported to receive an education in the most inclusive setting possible.  The department does not hold centralised comparative data on the level of individual student needs. Such data is maintained at individual school level and detailed within the individual student support file held by the school.  The Continuum of Support is the framework developed by the National Educational Psychological Service (NEPS) for schools to identify, plan and provide support for children and young people who experience difficulties with their learning. NEPS supports schools in implementing the Continuum of Support framework with each school taking responsibility for initial assessment, educational planning and supports for children and young people with special educational needs. Under this model, a child or young person does not require a psychological assessment diagnosis in order to access additional support at school.  This Continuum of Support framework recognises that special educational needs occur along a continuum, ranging from mild to more significant, and from transient to enduring. It recognises that children require different levels of support depending on their identified educational needs, and that needs may change over time.  Using this framework helps to ensure flexible and timely allocation of supports, so that those children with the greatest level of need have access to the greatest level of support.  My department and the NCSE are committed to delivering an education system that is of the highest quality and where every child and young person feels valued and is actively supported and nurtured to reach their full potential.

        "answerText": " Minister for Education and Youth  The Primary School Survey asked parents, guardians, school staff and boards of management members their preference about the primary schools in which they work, or in which their children currently attend, or will attend in coming years.  The primary school survey, which was launched on 4 November, closed on Tuesday 16 December.  The survey – the largest of its kind ever undertaken in Ireland – was school specific and, through its results, aims to enable my department to assess demand and preferences for different types of primary school provision including patronage/ethos, co-education or single-sex school provision and language of instruction (English or Irish).  My department recently issued initial figures setting out that 47% of eligible households have completed a survey, with over 230,000 responses at that stage. I will issue updated figures in due course.  I am delighted with the initial response rate from parents and primary school communities, and I sincerely thank all those who took part in the survey. My department is currently validating the survey responses. As part of this validation, the Eircodes are being checked against the department’s Primary Online Database in respect of primary school children and Child Benefit data in respect of younger children to ensure that the responses are from households with primary school children or younger children. My department’s validation process also involves checks for duplicate responses. PINs unique to each school were provided to each primary school for dissemination to all staff and all Board of Management members.  Through the survey, I and my department are seeking clear information on the preferences of parents and guardians about the primary schools which their children currently attend, or will attend in coming years, on a number of important areas of primary school provision. The results of the survey will help my department plan how education is provided at primary level.  This survey is not a final step. Where there is clear support from parents and guardians for change to be considered, a further process of inclusive dialogue will begin.  All responses to the survey will remain confidential and anonymous. ",

        "answerText": " The Taoiseach  I propose to take Questions Nos. 1 to 15, inclusive, together.  The Cabinet committee on housing last met yesterday, Monday, 15 December. The committee works to ensure a cross-Government approach to the implementation of our commitments regarding housing policy. This week’s meeting was specifically focused on our homelessness challenge, in particular the national housing plan commitments in this regard, including the development of a homeless prevention framework and a child and family homelessness action plan.  We are making good progress on the delivery of homes to those most in need across the country, with the new housing plan committed to delivering 72,000 social homes over its lifetime. However, as we increase supply, we also recognise that those experiencing, or at risk of, homelessness have a wide and complex variety of needs. We need to ensure that the appropriate services and policies are in place to support them. Housing is our single biggest issue as a country, with profound social and economic consequences. That is why it is at the centre of the Government’s focus.  Along with the largest ever commitment on social housing, the new national housing plan commits to delivering 300,000 new homes, including 90,000 affordable supports to help people who are struggling to have a home of their own. The plan sets out the highest ever commitment of State funding for housing, with €28 billion over the next five years, coupled with additional funding through State vehicles, including the Land Development Agency, the Housing Finance Agency, Home Building Finance Ireland, the First Home Scheme and the Irish Strategic Investment Fund. Housing delivery, along with infrastructure and utility investment to enable delivery at scale, is at the core of the agreed national development plan published in July, and, at €275 billion, the largest ever capital injection in the history of the State.  To build homes at the scale now required, we need improved and more resilient water, energy and transport services. We will see large-scale investment in all of these areas over the coming years. Last month under price review 6, the investment plan for energy infrastructure was finalised, including funding allocations of up to €18 billion to ESB and EirGrid, leveraged by the Government injection of €3.5 billion in equity to these companies. This will enable thousands more homes to be connected to the grid.  We have also published the investment plan for water, which sets out over €12 billion investment in our water infrastructure, the majority of which will support the delivery of our housing targets. In addition, we are tackling barriers to delivery, through the accelerating infrastructure report and action plan, which includes reforms which will support public and private sector delivery of homes at scale.  Housing is at the centre of the State’s investment and focus for the coming years. However, to meet our targets, we will also need significant delivery from the private sector and we have implemented a number of measures and reforms in support of this. We have focused on making apartment delivery more financially viable, reformed our planning process and created a stable policy environment to enable the private sector to deliver at scale.  We are seeing indications now that our measures are beginning to take effect, evidenced by CSO data showing that we have had an increase of almost 30% in homes approved for planning in quarter 3 of this year, in comparison with the same time period last year, with the number of apartments approved up by over 50%. These are clear indications of confidence. Work is under way to zone a significantly higher quantum of land across the country. Now is the time for ambitious execution, and we have set out a clear framework and roadmap for the coming years to do this. I am confident that we can build on our success to date and bring about a very significant scale-up in our delivery of housing over the lifetime of this Government. \n Deputy Séamus McGrath  I thank the Taoiseach. I welcome today's announcement in relation to the vacant property refurbishment grant and the extension of this grant until 2030. This provides important certainty from a policy point of view in relation to vacant properties. We know they are still a very significant challenge. I also welcome the new initiative in relation to the above the shop grant. Up to €140,000, where multiple properties are involved, is potentially available. That is very significant and the fact that it will be available by quarter 1 of the new year is very important. It is important to look at the local authorities and their resourcing in terms of being able to deal with this grant. I ask the Taoiseach to also look at that. We want these grants to be processed in a timely manner so that we can get on with utilising this currently under-occupied space. The resourcing of local authorities is important and I ask the Taoiseach to look at that. \n Deputy Paul McAuliffe  In my constituency between Shanowen Road and Collins Avenue there are proposals to build new apartment developments. While the additional new housing is incredibly welcome, unfortunately the under-utilised industrial estate there is currently occupied by Santry Boxing Club. Would the Taoiseach agree as well as powering ahead with the provision of new housing, Dublin City Council needs to have a more proactive strategy of making land available to sports clubs so they can avail of programmes like the sports capital grant? Santry Boxing Club is an amazing local facility and will be a great facility for those new homes that will be built. As well as enabling new homes, we need to put in place new facilities, and Dublin City Council needs to be more proactive in making land available to sports clubs. \n Deputy Shane Moynihan  As the Taoiseach said, the delivery of housing is the number one priority for this Government. That is why it is strategically important that all sectors of the Government support that aim, namely through the national development plan's transport sectoral plan, which was published recently. In my constituency, which the Taoiseach visited, we see it as one of the fastest-growing constituencies in the country, with large developments like Adamstown and Clonburris flying ahead. In its county development plans, South Dublin County Council is setting very ambitious targets for zoning. The key to enabling this zoning and to enabling delivery of those homes is the deployment and development of DART+ South West as a transport programme, to intensify the capacity on that line, not only benefitting commuters in Dublin Mid-West but also Kildare North, Dublin South-Central and Dublin-Central.  I am asking the Taoiseach for his support to do all we can to prioritise and bring forward, where possible, the delivery of Dart+ South West as a long overdue infrastructure requirement to not only allow catch-up on public transport in my area but also to plan for the future. \n Deputy John Connolly  One of the actions in the recently published housing plan is that the Department will be publishing quarterly and annual performance tables for new-build output versus targets per local authority, thereby ensuring transparency and accountability.  I understand that will commence next June in relation to social housing. We should also provide similar tables in relation to affordable housing. The local authorities should also be assessed on their output of affordable housing. What actions will the Government take with local authorities that are not meeting their housing targets? \n Deputy Ryan O'Meara  Last February the Government announced its intention to remove the requirement for planning permission for log cabins and modular homes in backyard developments. By the end of the Christmas recess, it will be nearly a year since we heard that announcement. One-off houses in rural Ireland can benefit if we allow log cabins and modular homes to be built not just in backyard developments. They are also one of the few affordable houses out there for young people in rural Ireland whom I speak to. I could give numerous examples of log cabins and modular homes across north Tipperary and north-west Kilkenny that are at threat of enforcement proceedings because they do not have planning permission. Enforcement should not be ongoing until we know what these regulations say. In addition, the development contributions for one-off rural houses should be scrapped again. They are simply a privilege for building on your own land. First, will we see these planning regulations that will exempt log cabins? Second, will this go beyond backyard developments and allow them in rural areas? Third, when will we see the regulations? \n An Ceann Comhairle  I call Deputy Ruth Coppinger. One question. \n Deputy Ruth Coppinger  I also send my solidarity to the Jewish community in Sydney following the appalling attack.  I am sure the Taoiseach agrees with me that cities should be liveable and should have culture as well as venues where people can meet, socialise and enjoy themselves. Will the Cabinet committee on housing and local government discuss the issue of The Complex, a very important cultural space in our capital where artists are currently housed but have been given an eviction notice for the middle of January? A protest on this will come to the Dáil tomorrow. I have attended meetings and other get-togethers in The Complex. In fact, it was the venue for the launch of one of the presidential campaigns. Dublin City Council is open to buying The Complex but only if it can be given 80% to 90% of the funding. We need to intervene to buy this for €10 million. It would be €80 million to buy or to build a similar space. \n Deputy Rose Conway-Walsh  I ask the Taoiseach to consider issuing an upfront fund to local authorities, but to Mayo County Council in particular, in order that they can turn around the vacant properties they have without having to go through the bureaucratic nightmare of applying for funding from central government on a house-by-house, unit-by-unit basis. Can the Taoiseach imagine what it is like to be a homeless person in Mayo watching council houses remain empty month after month while nothing is done? I will give him an example from a young mother in my constituency:  I am homeless, living in a friend's house. I've just had my first baby. She's now a month old. She was born at 36 weeks. I've been in and out of hospital the whole of the pregnancy with stress and anxiety. I developed diabetes also. I was rushed to a Dublin hospital for a week from bleeding and pains. I had a terrible experience. A lot of this stress has been brought on because of my homeless situation.  That is the case for many people. \n Deputy Barry Heneghan  I too join in the condolences on the attack that happened on the Jewish community in Australia.  I also support the plea for funding for The Complex.  Regarding the Cabinet committee on housing, across the country AHBs have signed turnkey deals that then collapse. In Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown, there was a recent scheme that had the contract signed, everything was above board, they were all ready and, at the last minute, when they were looking for funding, the Department denied the funding for 40 turnkey units. If we are to bring medium-sized and small developers into the market, this risk cannot be acceptable. We will not get the funding from the funding schemes, and it is putting all the risk on the developers. The homes are built, the deal collapses and the investor walks away. We want these small-scale developers to meet the housing targets. I have hundreds of people in my constituency looking for affordable housing, and this cannot happen. \n Deputy Darren O'Rourke  I want to raise the issue of child homelessness. In October there were 5,274 children in emergency accommodation. More than 150 of those were in my county, Meath. There is an expectation that at Christmas there will be more than 5,000 and that almost 1,000 of those will be in emergency accommodation for their second or third Christmas. Are there specific measures the Government will take in advance of Christmas, now a handful of days away, to minimise the number of children in homelessness this Christmas? \n Deputy Ruairí Ó Murchú  We all know the issue that exists in relation to housing, whether it is homelessness, the lack of supply, those who cannot get houses, whether from a rental point of view or a purchase point of view, and those languishing on social housing lists. However, we also have to look at the issue of estate management. I do not believe the local authorities, like Louth County Council, have the necessary powers when dealing with chaotic tenants. They may need supports, but even beyond that, we have seen outright criminality and drug-dealing. We know that AHBs have greater levels of power even in relation to the nuclear action of eviction. That should be the last thing that is looked at but, at the end of the day, it is a requirement. I have worked alongside the Louth local authority, the Garda and others in dealing with some situations and we have attempted to move people sideways to deal with the issue. Some very good work has been done, but we do not have the necessary tools, and that is the problem. \n Deputy Liam Quaide  One of the most infuriating parts of the housing crisis is the tens of thousands of properties that have been left idle and decaying throughout the country. Youghal's potential to be on a par with Kinsale for economic prosperity and tourism has been thwarted by the epic scale of dereliction that has been allowed to take place there over many years. Likewise, Castlemartyr and Midleton have many prime-location properties left like deserted husks where boutiques could be flourishing or community hubs or accommodation created. In Holland or Germany this would not be tolerated. Landlords would have to sell up or repurpose a vacant property within a reasonable period or face losing it. The Government's softly-softly approach to vacancy and dereliction is clearly not working, and our towns and villages are haunted by this policy failure. We need to see swift direct action by our local authorities with landlords who blight our streets with decaying properties and a much more urgent pursuit of derelict site levies. The collection of derelict site levies by Revenue is welcome, but why is the Government waiting until 2027 to implement this? \n Deputy Peadar Tóibín  The housing crisis has had varied and wide ramifications in Irish society. One of them is a serious fall in the fertility rate in this State. There has been a 30% fall in the number of births annually. There has been a 20,000 fall in the number of births annually since Celtic tiger times. Some 69% of people aged 25 years or under are living with their parents. Well over 40% of adults who are under 30 are living with their parents. That is changing the very nature of Irish society. The ability for adults to form relationships to have children is being deleted for hundreds of thousands of people. This is having massive ramifications. Schools are now noticing that there is a fall in the number of children being enrolled. An unbalanced demographic structure has serious consequences for our workforce and our pensions. Planning, permitting, licensing, tendering and judicial reviews here are among the slowest in the whole of the European Union. While the Taoiseach's Government has announced plans, they are not ambitious enough and I do not believe they will be implemented in a timely fashion. \n The Taoiseach  There were quite a number of questions there, beginning with Deputy Séamus McGrath. I welcome also the good initiative we have announced today, namely the extension of the vacant refurbishment grant to 2030, but specifically on the commercial properties and the €140,000 plus a €5,000 grant for assistance to support the owner to design a project. The Deputy is right in saying that we need to make sure that the local authorities prioritise this - in other words, that they put a project manager or whatever in charge of this operation in the towns and the cities to make this a reality. It needs to be driven with someone who is accountable and who is doing this every single day, in my view. I will talk to the Minister about that.  We need to alert all the business committees in towns and cities because people need to know. If you combine it with the living city initiative, there are real prospects of, once and for all, getting activity in towns and city centres to address dereliction and allow for change of use. Due to changing patterns of trade and so on, many commercial uses are no longer sustainable, so there is an opportunity for increased numbers residential units in towns and cities.  Deputy McAuliffe raised the topic of the Santry Boxing Club. I was recently with the Land Development Agency, LDA, on the southside, where an existing boxing club has been incorporated into a housing development. A new boxing club is being built in the housing development. That is the way to go. Is the local authority involved in the specific development to which the Deputy referred? It is. The local authority should look seriously at that example. Amenities matter in communities and society. They give young people opportunities. It seems to me that some accommodation must be made for Santry Boxing Club. The other example was a good initiative. The name of the boxing club escapes me now, but the people will have a first-class boxing club as a result of the development. It might be a bigger development. In fairness to the LDA, it saw that needed to be done. The Deputy might give me the details.  Deputy Shane Moynihan spoke about the interdependence of the national transport plan in terms of infrastructure and housing delivery. Housing delivery will depend on infrastructure delivery. I am acutely aware of planning considerations. South Dublin County Council is looking at 10,000 to 18,000 new zonings for housing. That will be dependent on DART+ South West. I have had meetings with the Minister for public expenditure and the Minister for climate and transport, Deputy Darragh O'Brien, to ensure we can underpin the development of DART+ South West. We can make progress on that to give the certainty that the council, Deputy Moynihan and the people in the area require.  Deputy Connolly asked about quarterly tables for social housing. He asked about applying such an approach to affordable housing. I will talk to the Minister. It is a fair point. The councils control a bit more for social housing, but outputs should be across the board. The first issue is to highlight those councils that are not performing. It becomes fairly obvious in a league table scenario which councils are not performing. The actions can take a number of forms. We have to work through the actions. There could be disincentives or limited finance. We have to work through that, but there must be consequences or direct action from the State to override councils that are not performing in respect of housing more generally.  Deputy O'Meara spoke about log cabins and modular homes. I hope that the Minister will in February have a list of exempted developments. I understand it has expanded significantly. There have been a lot of submissions from Government Departments and agencies, particularly those with acute issues, including health, for example, where we need urgent public services. The Minister recently indicated to me that it would be February that we will have completion of that. It is fairly complex and much bigger than we originally anticipated.  The rural housing guidelines need to be published. I have asked the Minister to prioritise that. I fully accept what the Deputy is saying about the potential for enabling and helping young people in rural Ireland to afford housing at a reasonable cost when it comes to buying or renting. We will keep an eye on that. We will look at the development levies over time in respect of rural buildings on people's land although services of one kind or another are required.  I fundamentally agree with Deputy Coppinger that cities should be liveable and that there should be strong social support and creative cultural amenities. The Deputy said the local authority is depending on someone else. Other local authorities tend to get on with it and are in a position to facilitate either the acquisition or purchase of a building without having to do the simple equation and getting the Department to pay out for every single acquisition. The Minister for public expenditure has taken an interest in this issue. I will check the current lie of the land in respect of the Complex. I know Deputy Heneghan also raised that issue.  To Deputy Conway-Walsh, I say that there is no reason why voids should take so long. There has to be some framework of control for the Department. We discovered recently with the tenant in situ scheme that houses were being bought with people living in them. Those houses are bought by councils and suddenly there is €80,000 or €100,000 going into the house. The original objective of that was to stop people going into homelessness. When a local authority house becomes vacant, unless there is something majorly wrong structurally, it should be occupied within a month. We have given huge money to local authorities for voids over the past five years. They should get on with it. They let the houses lie idle for too long. It is inexcusable. In some councils, there is inertia. I have seen it. People leave very good houses for one reason or another, the shutters go up and the houses are left there for three or four months. Those houses should be reoccupied once the electrics and everything else are grand. If we have to get around to repairing them, we can at least give someone the house. That is my view. I get impatient about it from time to time, to be honest. I hear what the Deputy is saying. If you give an upfront grant, there is no guarantee it will be spent on voids, and that is the problem.  I do not have the details of the 40-turnkey units to which Deputy Heneghan referred. Are they in Dún Laoghaire? \n Deputy Barry Heneghan  Yes. \n The Taoiseach  Has the Deputy moved across? \n Deputy Barry Heneghan  I am national now. \n The Taoiseach  The Deputy has a wide compass. He is national now. I ask him to give me the details and I will follow through. It should not happen. I do not know the background to that.  I appreciate the Deputy's comments about the Jewish community in Ireland and the impact that what happened in Bondi Beach has had on the Jewish community globally and in Ireland. The murder that took place was quite shocking. Others were injured. The Deputy also referenced the Complex.  Deputy O'Rourke spoke about child homelessness. The meeting of the Cabinet subcommittee on housing yesterday was entirely about different aspects of homelessness. We had good presentation of data. The data illustrates that there is a wide variety of reason why people become homeless. There are different factors. There is a high rate for singles in homelessness as well as children. There are different elements to the issue. An increasing amount of those who leave direct provision end up homeless. Family reunification comes with that. The link between migration and housing has grown, but is not the only factor. Family separation is a factor. Different factors give rise to homelessness, and specifically child homelessness. The Minister has specific measures. He achieved €100 million in the budget to acquire social housing and housing more generally to take more families out of emergency accommodation and get them into either local authority houses or acquired homes. There is a specific programme ahead now.  Have I dealt with everyone? I have not. \n An Ceann Comhairle  Deputies Ó Murchú and Tóibín. \n The Taoiseach  How could I forget Deputy Ó Murchú? He spoke about estate management powers to deal with what he described as \"chaotic tenants\". There are powers. I am not sure that the AHBs have different powers. They just have a different way of operating. \n Deputy Ruairí Ó Murchú  It is about eviction. \n The Taoiseach  They have a different of operating. They lay it down from the beginning. \n Deputy Ruairí Ó Murchú  It is easier for them to evict people. \n The Taoiseach  Local authorities have struggled with this for quite a long time. My own belief is that persistent misbehaviour and so on should mean you lose the tenancy. That is what should happen. It is hard. We know of housing estates that have awful tensions, difficulties and challenges. I would be glad to work with the Deputy on the issue. I will talk to the Minister about it.  Deputy Quaide spoke about the thousands of houses that have been left lying idle. We give responsibilities to the local authorities. Deputy Connolly talked about league tables. There is a league table showing which local authorities did what in respect of derelict sites. It is very telling. There are two or three that did an exceptional job. If they can do it, why cannot others? It begs the question of whether there is, or has been historically, inertia in local authorities about the Derelict Sites Act. Revenue will now be charged with it. That will bring about a change and better behaviour. The reason for the length of time, and I hope it can be accelerated, is the mapping. I have challenged officials from the Department of Finance and Revenue about this issue. I have asked why the maps are not there already and why they would take so long. Apparently, at the time of the land tax and others, the mapping was not as comprehensive as people would have expected.  That is the issue there. I think it is a game-changer and will be a game-changer.  Deputy Tóibín is making a link between falling fertility and the housing issue. Again, there are a number of variables, I imagine, responsible for that. The bottom line is we do need to provide more housing more quickly to as many young people as possible. It is a social need. Every young person in the country has a right to aspire to owning a home, and many do aspire to owning a home, or some young families being able to rent a home at an affordable cost. We are building substantially more houses than we did five years ago. We are doing about 30,000 odd now compared to 20,000 in 2020. We need to go to 50,000 and we need all hands on deck in that respect. I do not think enrolments are going down in schools yet, I think they are going up. \n Deputy Peadar Tóibín  They are; 30 schools are falling this year. And childcare. ",

        "answerText": " The Taoiseach  I propose to take Questions Nos. 16 to 24, inclusive, together.  I attended the leaders’ summit at COP30 in Belém, Brazil, on 6 and 7 November. Coming a decade after the Paris Agreement and during a period of enhanced geopolitical turbulence, my attendance at the summit was an important opportunity to show Ireland’s continuing commitment to the objectives of the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change and the Paris Agreement to limit emissions in order to avoid the worst impacts of climate change. I delivered Ireland’s national statement on 6 November, highlighting the reality that climate change is no longer a distant threat and pointing to the remarkable litany of record-breaking climate events in the 12 months since COP29 in Azerbaijan, including Storm Éowyn which brought the strongest wind gusts ever recorded in Ireland and the highest storm surges on the western seaboard. We saw the damage that Storm Bram caused last week to counties all over the country. I also argued that the sharpest impacts of climate change are felt by the world’s most vulnerable people and countries and noted that no country can successfully address the crisis of climate change alone.  I participated in two thematic round tables with my fellow leaders to discuss climate issues of common concern. The first focused on \"Climate and Nature: Forests and Oceans\". I reiterated Ireland’s strong support for the agreement reached at COP15 to protect at least 30% of land and oceans by 2030. The second thematic session took the form of a panel discussion on \"Energy transition and ten years of the Paris Agreement: NDCs and financing\". I expressed Ireland’s commitment to ensuring a just and inclusive energy transition pathway for all nations. I also shared Ireland’s focus on accelerating the delivery of renewable generation. I also participated in a small round table hosted by President Lula da Silva and attended also by the United Nations Secretary General, António Guterres, on climate adaptation and resilience. I spoke of Ireland’s commitment in this area with 80% of our climate finance concentrated on adaptation.  I also attended an event launching the Tropical Forest Forever Fund, hosted by President Lula. This global initiative aims to finance the conservation of tropical forests. I reaffirmed Ireland’s commitment to the preservation and sustainable use of the Amazon rainforest. I announced Ireland’s commitment to provide €15 million over the next three years to the Amazon fund, with the aim of preventing and combating deforestation.  While in Belém, I also took the opportunity to visit the offices of the United Nations High Commission for Refugees, where I met with representatives of some of the refugees they work with, including indigenous people from the Amazon displaced by climate change. To date in 2025, Ireland has provided over €25.5 million in funding to UNHCR. \n Deputy Malcolm Byrne  I welcome the fact that the Taoiseach attended the COP in Brazil as head of Government. It is appropriate that he did so. I welcome his remarks while there. I ask the Taoiseach to consider that Ireland might consider hosting a future COP to raise awareness of the important issues he has outlined.  I do want to express concern that if we are going to reduce our own dependence on fossil fuels and get people out of cars, we have to provide them with a realistic public transport alternative. I am passionate about rail travel but unfortunately the M11 is increasingly becoming a car park every morning. The problem for those travelling along the M11 into the capital, unlike a number of other commuter routes, is that we do not have a realistic rail alternative. We have fewer services, worse rolling stock and more overcrowding than any other rail service. What particularly annoys me is the fact that yesterday, the rail project prioritisation strategy made no commitments whatsoever about improvements for the Rosslare rail line and further looked at abandoning the proposals to develop and reopen the Rosslare to Waterford rail line. If we are to provide a real alternative and reduce our dependence on fossil fuels and car use, there has to be a real public transport alternative. I want assurances that the Department of Transport has not abandoned the rail commuters along the Rosslare rail line. \n Deputy Naoise Ó Cearúil  I note that, following the Taoiseach's attendance at COP in Belém, the EU made a significant decision to permanently stop Russian gas imports and phase out Russian oil. Similar to Deputy Byrne, I wish to highlight the issue of reducing our reliance on fossil fuels in the context of significant investment in public transport, in terms of DART+ West, for example, going to Maynooth and then Kilcock. The prioritisation of DART+ South West was not announced. There is significant traffic and build-up on the N7, M7, N4 and M4, particularly the N7 coming from Naas, Sallins and Celbridge. Indeed, Deputy Shane Moynihan has raised it previously. We need to ensure that these key pieces of infrastructure are prioritised along the commuter line that is causing the greatest amount of traffic. \n Deputy Darren O'Rourke  One of the most effective ways we can reduce emissions is by encouraging people on to public transport. I want to raise the lack of public transport in Bellewstown, County Meath. A 13-year-old boy, James Black, has started a campaign there and has hundreds of petition signatures calling for a public bus services for the village of Bellewstown. Fair play and well done to him for that. He has got an amount of media attention about it. He is very articulate and very clear in what he is trying to achieve.  The connecting Ireland scheme in the Department of Transport is a very good one but it is underfunded and Bellewstown is not included in it. Will the Taoiseach increase funding to the connecting Ireland scheme and will he include Bellewstown, County Meath in it? \n Deputy Liam Quaide  We heard a lot during the last Government about how much more investment went into the National Parks and Wildlife Service but in east Cork and Waterford, the level of under-resourcing has been baffling. In east Cork, we have had no ranger for approximately 12 of the last 15 years. There has been no district conservation officer for 18 months and no regional manager in place for years over east Cork and Waterford. It is difficult to give precise figures for these vacancies, because the Department has been incredibly opaque in response to questions I have submitted on recruitment to the NPWS. In one response, the Minister referred to \"perceived vacancies\", as if we were all imagining those roles being vacant. Also, bizarrely, the Department will not give details of staffing by geographical area for \"operational security reasons\". This is akin to An Garda Síochána not sharing numbers of gardaí employed in a given division. The Department also will not give any information on recruitment campaigns being undertaken. Meanwhile, hedgerows and trees are being trashed with impunity and the whole idea of habitat protection looks more like a bad joke in this country. When are we going to see more transparency from the Department of heritage on staffing of the NPWS? When are we going to see those crucial roles in east Cork and Waterford filled? \n Deputy Peadar Tóibín  Today the Minister of State, Deputy Thomas Byrne, stated that the Mercosur deal held many benefits for the Irish farmers and the wider economy. He said that for Ireland, Mercosur could be a significant beneficiary. This is incredible. It is the Minister of State putting up the white flag of surrender in terms of Mercosur. It comes just a few days after the Government put up the white flag in terms of the Irish fishing industry. Make no mistake about it, the Mercosur trade agreement will damage the livelihoods of hundreds of thousands of farmers in this country. All the fine words about COP mean nothing if we are going to facilitate or allow Mercosur to go through. It beggars belief that at a time of climate crisis, we will be bringing in Brazilian beef, which is produced in an environmentally unfriendly way, by which forests are burnt down and land is overgrazed, not to mention the environmental cost of transporting all that beef from South America to Europe. Will the Government stop speaking from both sides of its mouth in terms of Mercosur? \n Deputy Ruairí Ó Murchú  It is difficult to believe that we are talking about rail services being cancelled. These are proposed new services that make complete sense because we want people to move to public transport. We know the advantages that exist in that regard. One of the new rail services that was being proposed between Clongriffin and Drogheda has been mothballed. This would have allowed for further express services to Dundalk, Drogheda, Newry and Belfast. Such services are absolutely necessary because they are allowed to skip slower services. What is happening does not make any sense at this point. Will the Taoiseach seek some clarity in respect of this matter? I other colleagues in expressing absolute anger if this is the road we are going to take. No pun intended. \n The Taoiseach  I thank Deputy Byrne for acknowledging that it was important to attend the COP, even though it was a long distance to go. We needed to send a signal given that we are at a point at which the issue of climate change is receding in terms of political prioritisation. This is a real concern. Some people are pulling back from their commitments.  On hosting a future COP in Ireland, next autumn we will have the largest ever political meeting held in Ireland. There will be over 40 states represented. It is a ginormous undertaking to host a COP, but it is something the country should aspire to do in the future. It depends on the shape and nature of a COP. In some ways it has become very big. Maybe it is has gone too far in some respects in the context of how it has evolved. We need to get back to the more fundamental origin and idea around COP, which was countries coming together to make decisions on global agreements in respect of sustainability, the future of the planet and the impact of climate change.  I will look at the matter of rail project prioritisation. I take on board what the Deputy said. We have a lot of projects that are needed. We do not have commensurate capital, but I will have a look at where the Rosslare railway line is. We put a lot of money into Rosslare on the custom side and all of that in the context of Brexit. We did it in double-quick time. Rosslare to Waterford is an important link. I will have a look at that to see what we can do and where we are. \n Deputy Malcolm Byrne  There is nothing on the roster----- \n An Ceann Comhairle  This is not a back-and-forth. \n The Taoiseach  I said I am going to have a look at it. The Deputy asked me to have a look at it, so I am telling him that I am going to have a look at it.  Deputy Ó Cearúil is correct on the moves we made in terms of dependency on Russian oil and gas. On public transport, it is key. I have spoken to the Ministers for public expenditure and Transport in respect of DART+ South West. That has gone through all the planning and is shovel ready. The county council has zonings for between 10,000 to 18,000 houses. It feels that this is essential infrastructure. I am seeing if we can do something to make that we progress the project. That is work I am engaged in at the moment with the relevant Ministers.  Deputy O'Rourke referred to public transport more generally and to a young person named James Black. I pay tribute to him for his civic initiative, participation and being involved in something like that in terms of public service for Bellewstown. I will talk to the Minister and make him aware of that. On Connecting Ireland, I take on board the Deputy's views.  Deputy Quaide referred to the National Parks and Wildlife Service, NPWS. There has been huge investment in recruitment. The investment in the NPWS has more or less doubled since 2020. I took a personal interest in this. I worked previous with the then Minister, Malcolm Noonan, on it and continue to work on it with the Minister of State, Deputy Christopher O'Sullivan. Recently, we announced a €700,000 lifeline for Fota Wildlife Park through the NPWS because of the understanding work that Fota does in respect of conservation of particular species and so forth. I will engage with NPWS in respect of the issues the Deputy has raised to see if we can throw some light on the situation.  Deputy Tóibín referred to Mercosur. There was no agreement on that. It was not put to COREPER last Friday. I do not have the up-to-date information, but it seems unlikely now that it will put before COREPER before Christmas. What we have undertaken to do is work with like-minded countries, particularly France and Italy----- \n Deputy Peadar Tóibín  What is our position? \n The Taoiseach  -----in terms of securing additional safeguards. Quite a significant number of safeguards have been secured. That is contrary to what was there a year ago. They are taking the form of legal instruments that the Commission has committed to.  We succeeded in securing the nitrates derogation. It is a significant advancement that we now have that for a further three years. It was challenging and difficult. We worked hard with the Commission to get it over the line. Approximately 200,000 tonnes of Mercosur beef come into Europe on an annual basis as it stands. The new initiative under Mercosur would allow 99,000 of those to be brought in under a reduced tariff preference. The Minister of State, Deputy Thomas Byrne, spoke about the wider issues around Mercosur. All trade agreements bring benefits and losses. There is no any heresy in saying that. The Canada deal was tremendous for Ireland in terms of the increased exports for SMEs and so on. I accept that every agreement is different. At the moment, there is no sense of any breakthrough or agreement in respect of Mercosur. That is where we are at present.  Deputy Ó Murchú referred to the Clongriffin to Drogheda service. Capital is not limitlessness. \n Deputy Ruairí Ó Murchú  I get that. I was just wondering. \n The Taoiseach  If we were to add up the figures from everybody's contributions, I would guess that we would arrive at another €50 billion. We have to try keep things moving with planning in the context of progressing as many projects as we possibly can and to make sure that we have sustainability, financing and all of that. I will have to look at the rail prioritisation strategy that emerged on Friday. \n An Ceann Comhairle  I thank the Taoiseach. ",

        "answerText": " Tánaiste and Minister for Finance  The European Commission launched an anti-dumping investigation in May 2025 into Chinese imports of new pneumatic tyres for passenger cars and light lorries after a complaint was received from the Coalition Against Unfair Tyre Imports on behalf of EU tyre producers. The investigation aims to determine if the Chinese imported tyres are being sold at artificially low prices, causing harm to the EU's domestic tyre industry. Where the investigation confirms dumping, the EU may impose anti-dumping duties on these tyres. The investigation shall be concluded within 14 months of its launch.  While the investigation is ongoing, there is a risk that stockpiles of tyres under investigation may be imported prior to the conclusion of the investigation, thus avoiding any potential anti-dumping duty. To avoid this scenario, the EU advised customers of the possibility that anti-dumping could be applied retrospectively, up to a maximum of nine months after goods are imported.  To ensure that importers do not inadvertently import tyres which might be liable to retrospective anti-dumping duty, each customs administration in the EU is obliged to review all import declarations of goods under investigation. Revenue has reviewed all such declarations in the Revenue import system, AIS, since 29 July 2025, the date from which retrospective duties may be charged.  Revenue has contacted each importer to get written confirmation from them that they are aware of the potential anti-dumping duty charges pending the completion of the EU investigation. This ensures that all importers are aware of the potential additional tax that they may have to pay in the future if the EU applies ADD to these goods retrospectively. The conditions for retroactive collection of duties, if any, will be included in the regulation imposing definitive duties.  While the EU’s investigation is ongoing (potentially up until July 2026), the EU may decide to impose provisional anti-dumping measures on this product in advance of the conclusion of the investigation, with the deadline for this being 21 January 2026. However, at present we have no information on whether the EU will decide to take this course of action. ",

This investment in County Cavan has supported the completion of 24 school building projects, including 1 new school building and currently there are 4 school building projects in construction. At present no large scale, additional accommodation or modular school building projects are at Stage 3 in County Cavan.  The current status of all projects is set out, under item number ten, at the following link (www.gov.ie). This is updated on a regular basis to reflect project progress through the various stages of capital appraisal, site acquisition, design, tender and construction. ",

        "answerText": " Minister for Education and Youth  The Government takes revelations of historical sexual abuse in schools with the utmost seriousness and has established a Commission of Investigation chaired by Mr. Justice Michael MacGrath to investigate the handling of complaints and allegations of historical sexual abuse in schools. The Commission was the principal recommendation of the Report of the Scoping Inquiry into Historical Sexual Abuse in Day and Boarding Schools Run by Religious Orders.  In addition, the Scoping Inquiry’s report recognised the significance of the issue of redress for survivors and their expressed wish that those running schools where child sexual abuse occurred should be held accountable financially and it recommended that consideration be given by the Government to establishing a redress scheme for survivors.  The high-level Inter Departmental Group (IDG) established to advise Government on the recommendations of the Scoping Inquiry recognised redress as an important element of accountability for survivors. The IDG recognises that consideration of a redress scheme may have far-reaching implications and has advised that further work needs to be undertaken to ensure that the Government is fully informed in any decision it may take. The IDG has commenced this work and aims to report within 18 months.  The work of the IDG on this issue will not impede the progress of the Commission of Investigation, which will begin its work in parallel. The Commission does not have a role in relation to redress.  The purpose of this further work of the IDG is to ensure that Government is fully informed before making a decision on redress and that, if it decides that a redress scheme should be established, those responsible for schools where historical sexual abuse happened meet their obligations to survivors.

        "answerText": " Minister for Education and Youth  In order to plan for school provision and analyse the relevant demographic data, my department divides the country into 314 school planning areas and uses a geographical information system, using data from a range of sources, including CSO census data, child benefit and school enrolment data, to identify where the pressure for school places across the country will arise and where additional school accommodation is needed at primary and post-primary level.  Major new residential developments have the potential to alter the demand for school places at a local level. In that regard, as part of the demographic demand analysis, my department monitors planning and construction activity in the residential sector. This involves the analysis of data sources from local authorities and the CSO along with the engagement with local authorities and the construction sector. In this way, up-to-date information on significant new residential developments is obtained and factored into the demographic analysis exercise. This is necessary to ensure that schools infrastructure planning is keeping pace with demographic changes, at a local level, where there is a constantly evolving picture with planned new residential development.  In addition to ongoing demographic analyses, my department continues to liaise with Local Authorities in respect of potential longer-term requirements for educational provision. My department engages further on such matters with the Council through the review of the County Development Plan, preparation of Local Area Plans and other relevant statutory planning processes.  Where demographic data indicates that additional provision is required, the delivery of such additional provision is dependent on the circumstances of each case and may, be provided through:  • Utilising existing unused capacity within a school or schools,  • Extending the capacity of a school or schools,  • Provision of a new school or schools.  If additional accommodation is required, the aim to try and facilitate this, as much as possible, by way of expansion of existing schools rather than establishing new schools. The expansion of existing schools is consistent with wider Government objectives under Project Ireland 2040 for an increased emphasis on compact growth. In respect of post primary schools, new post primary schools must have a student enrolment capacity of 600-1,000 students and must be co-educational. A lower threshold of 400 students may apply to gaelcholáistí, having regard to the alternative of establishing an Irish-medium unit (aonad) in an English-medium school.  New schools are only established in areas of demographic growth as the resources available for school infrastructure have to be prioritised to meet the needs of areas of significant population increase so as to ensure that every child has a school place.  The pace of delivery of additional residential developments, along with updated enrolment data and demographic data will be kept under review and this will inform the timing of further school requirements across school planning areas.

As a result of significant investment by this government in the NCSE the number of SENOs has increased to 120, an increase of 47 from the previous sanctioned. The SENO plays a crucial function in the framework of special education, charged with a variety of responsibilities to ensure that students with special educational needs (SEN) receive individualised support and services, aligned with the continuum of support.  SENOs assess and identify students with SEN at primary, post primary and special school levels. The role involves significant interaction with parents/children, teachers and school leaders, health care professionals, school authorities, Health Service Executive and other relevant government agencies.  At local level, the NCSE has increased the number of support teams available to parents and schools, throughout the country, from a 10-team structure to a 20-team structure. All SENO grades are now assigned on a county basis and undertake caseloads associated with that county only, and on a reduced caseload basis.  Local SENOs are available to offer advice, support and guidance as required to ensure students with special educational needs are supported to achieve their full potential. ",

It is also a key priority for me, my department and for the National Council for Special Education (NCSE).  The vast majority of students with special educational needs attend mainstream classes with their peers, supported by special education teachers (SETs) and special needs assistants (SNAs). Where students with more complex needs require additional supports, special class and special school places are provided. This is in keeping with policy on an inclusive education, which advocates that students will be supported to receive an education in the most inclusive setting possible.  The process for allocating SNAs has been in place since 2014 and has not changed this year. SNA allocations for the 2025/26 school year were notified to schools in June 2025. The NCSE Guidelines for the Review of SNA Allocations 2025/26 https://ncse.ie/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/NCSE_SNA_Guidelines.pdf issued to schools on the 12 September 2025. In response to concerns raised the NCSE subsequently published the Clarification Document to be read in accompaniment with NCSE SNA Guidelines. https://ncse.ie/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Clarification-Document-to-be-read-in-accompaniment-with-NCSE-SNA-Guidelines-8.10.2025.pdf  The NCSE continues to respond to increased demand for SNA support as is reflected growing SNA workforce which now numbers more than 23,000, an increase of 43% in the last 5 years alone. Some review requests can be concluded as an office-based exercise, whilst others require a school to be visited in order to observe the current deployment of SNA support in the school setting.  The timeframe for concluding a review can vary depending on the school context or the nature of the information provided. Where the review results in an increase in SNA resources the provisions of DEY Circular Recruitment and Appointment Procedures for Special Needs Assistants (SNAs) www.gov.ie/en/department-of-education/circulars/recruitment-and-appointment-procedures-for-special-needs-assistants-snas/ must be followed.  My department and the NCSE are committed to delivering an education system that is of the highest quality and where every child and young person feels valued and is actively supported and nurtured to reach their full potential.

        "answerText": " Minister of State at the Department of Education and Youth (Deputy Michael Moynihan)  The Government is committed to the accelerated provision of additional special class and special school places next year by providing at least 3,000 new places in locations where it best meets existing and future demand. The provision of timely information is a key requirement to support the forward planning of new special education provision.  The National Council for Special Education is the statutory body tasked with sanctioning new special education provision in our schools. The council is reviewing and assessing information provided through the parents' notification process, which closed on 1 October. I understand that the National Council for Special Education will commence sanctioning new special classes for 2026-27 this week, which is four months ahead of last year.  The new timeline of 1 October was publicised widely and communicated to schools, special education advocacy groups and parent representative bodies. The council also undertook a lot of work at local level to ensure that families were aware of the timeline and the process. This earlier date in October coincides with when schools begin enrolment processes and so affords parents the opportunity to enrol in existing classes. Many mainstream schools, particularly at post-primary level, commence admissions processes for the following school year on 1 October annually.  The council advises that the majority of children and young people coming through the parents notify process and seeking a special class or a special school place for the 2026-27 school year are already enrolled in school and are being supported by existing special education teachers and special needs assistants.  As with other applications for support, it is important that those who come forward after the closing date are assured that they are not forgotten or excluded from the system.  I stress that the council will continue to support all children made known to it after 1 October in their existing placement with appropriate supports. At the same time, it is critical that the council has as much local information as possible as early as possible to effectively plan new provision. \n Deputy Darren O'Rourke  Gabhaim buíochas leis an Aire Stáit, but he did not answer the question I asked. If he had done, he would have given me some numbers. He would have given me the numbers notified through the portal by 1 October and the numbers that have contacted the NCSE. Does he have those figures? It is a terrible reflection on the system if he does not have them because the whole point of this new procedure is that we have a system that accounts for demand. Does the Minister of State have those figures, and if so, what are they? That will give us a clear picture of the demand that has been indicated and the impact. There is lots of concern that people missed the deadline because they did not have a recommendation or were not aware of the deadline. It is the first year of it. I ask the Minister of State to give us some indication of that if he can. \n Deputy Michael Moynihan  On the deadline, there was a huge amount of concern, particularly over recent years, that we were not planning properly for special classes and special schools in an early and a timely fashion. We brought forward the 1 October deadline and announced that earlier this year to bring greater clarity and certainty because families last year, particularly in the March-April period, were fierce frustrated not knowing what the future held in education terms for their children. We brought forward the 1 October deadline. The deadline was put in place to ensure we knew what the demand was for 1 September 2026. Those figures are being gone through meticulously to make sure that the classes are opened where the demand is and that we understand where the demand is. A lot of that work is ongoing. We hope to announce a number of the classes this week, but there is a huge amount of work still going through where the numbers are. The engagement between the council and the families is ongoing.  I might come back on a few of the other issues the Deputy raised. \n Deputy Darren O'Rourke  This has been the experience for a couple of years now but I must say that I absolutely despair at the lack of basic information for Opposition TDs and the general public on this point. Earlier this week, another curveball or grenade - call it whatever you want - was thrown into the system and has caused major concern. That is the issue of what is now a recommendation. What does it mean for children and assessments of need this year and next? The Irish National Teachers Organisation, INTO, said yesterday that it was deeply disappointed. It said this was an act of bad faith and that the Departments of education and children and equality did not consult the INTO. It seems that the Department of children and its Minister are saying that in the future, the Department of education will reach an agreement. What exactly is the state of affairs there? Teachers and principals contact us regularly. They are deeply concerned that they will have an additional responsibility that many feel they are not qualified to deliver. \n Deputy Michael Moynihan  For the assessment of need and because of the challenges we face, there is no doubt but that we need to move away from the model we have. We need to get therapists to children faster and not be tied up in too much bureaucracy. There has been a huge push to have assessments of need. Right now, you do not need an assessment of need to access education. A lot of work has been done, and I know that officials are meeting education partners today to bring clarity on the very question asked by the Deputy. We will certainly bring extreme clarity. If this system is to work within education, all our education partners must have bought in, including the teacher unions and people right across the education spectrum. Every one of those people plays a significant role in special education. I assure the Deputy that intense work is ongoing at the moment to ensure we bring absolute clarity to the roles involved in decision-making, and that decisions are guided by the best possible outcomes for children. Those will be finalised. We will update the House when those issues are agreed between the various education partners. ",

        "answerText": " Deputy Darren O'Rourke  I wish to ask the Minister of State the number of schools referred to the financial support services unit in the academic year 2023-24, 2024-25 and to date in 2025-26 and the measures he is taking to support schools financially through this winter in the absence of a cost-of-living package. \n Deputy Michael Moynihan  The Government is committed to increasing funding to support schools and the programme for Government commits to increasing capitation funding to schools of all types to ensure they can meet day-to-day running costs. Schools have autonomy in their spending, allowing them to make decisions on spending independently at school level. The financial support services unit, FSSU, funded by the Department is an important source of advice and support to schools on financial matters, including budgeting and cash flow management. In circumstances where a school is in financial difficulty, the Department requests the FSSU to carry out an evaluation of the financial position in the school. The Department is committed to offering all available and appropriate supports to these schools, which may include an advance in capitation grant funding, or other measures, as may be appropriate. As a result of such evaluations, a small number of schools required an advance in capitation grant funding to be paid to address immediate cash flow issues. The Department continues to liaise with the FSSU regarding supports and guidance to all schools.  In the 2023-24 school year, 31 schools were referred to the unit and two received an advance in capitation grant funding. In the 2024-25 school year, 61 schools were referred to the FSSU and 17 received an advance in capitation grant funding. In the 2025-26 school year to date, 18 schools were referred to the FSSU and nine received an advance in capitation grant funding. The Department has secured €39 million in budget 2026 towards increased capitation funding for primary, post-primary and special schools. This will result in the standard rates increasing from €224 to €274 for primary schools and from €386 to €406 for post-primary schools. The increases in the budget are in addition to the 12% increases as part of budget 2025. The last three budgets have resulted in an increase in the level of capitation grant rates of almost 50% paid to primary schools and approximately 28% paid to post-primary schools. \n Deputy Darren O'Rourke  I thank the Minister of State for those figures, but they paint a picture that is a very stark one in terms of the financial challenge schools are going through. Regarding those numbers, we are not at Christmas yet and we have 18 schools referred to the FSSU so far this year and nine that have needed advanced payments. A number of schools, including Darver in neighbouring County Louth, have been high-profile in terms of the financial challenge they are facing.  Regarding the Minister of State's figures on the capitation and the funding, schools are worse off in real terms because of the lack of a cost-of-living package this year. There is a net reduction in the funding for them when we take out the cost-of-living package. Will the Minister of State look at introducing a cost-of-living package for schools this year in light of the cost of energy, insurance and heating? \n Deputy Michael Moynihan  The next capitation grant payments due to primary and post-primary schools will be paid in January 2026. The Department is committing to offering all available and appropriate supports to schools experiencing financial difficulties and advises any such schools to engage early with the Department and FSSU. We increased them, and I think it is important that we put a long-term footing in place in relation to the capitation grants and that there is not just a once-off approach but a sensible way of making sure the capitation grant money meets the demands in schools. I can stress, though, that the Department is working extremely hard to engage with all school communities. Any school community that has difficulties should liaise as early as possible with the FSSU and the Department because we are there to help guide and resolve issues they may have at local level. \n Deputy Darren O'Rourke  Costs are increasing and, in real terms, last year capitation per student in primary schools was €236 and €400 per student in post-primary schools. That is when we take the capitation and the cost-of-living aspects into account. This year, it is €224 per student at primary level versus €236 last year, while at secondary level, it is €386 per student compared with €400 last year. That is a net decrease in real terms at a time when costs are increasing. Is it any wonder increasing numbers of schools are being referred to the FSSU? In addition, €23 million is being raised through voluntary contributions to subsidise so-called free education. That is not evenly distributed, so we know there are many schools that do not have access to that option and are in deep, deep trouble. I do not get a sense that there is a recognition from the Government in this regard. It needs to introduce a cost-of-living package for schools. \n Deputy Michael Moynihan  The capitation grant increases in several budgets in recent years have been there. This means there is a serious commitment to education right across the system. We have record funding in the Department to meet the needs of student communities and make sure they have the best possible outcomes. Investment in education continues. This is the case whether it is in special or mainstream education, and the Government is very much committed to it. We are not blind to the challenges at school gates or in school communities, and we have engaged very thoroughly with school communities that have faced financial challenges over the last number of years and again this year. The increase in the capitation grant gives a sense of where we are at with it. Huge funding is also being given right across the spectrum. I have to push back on the suggestion that we do not understand what is going on in education. We do understand it and we are investing in education. ",

        "answerText": " Deputy Darren O'Rourke  Will the Minister of State provide an update on Oíche na hÓige and outline how he intends to build on the event through capital investment in youth facilities across the State? \n Deputy Michael Moynihan  Arising from budget 2026, an additional €8 million in current and capital funding is being allocated to support the sustainability and development of youth services. This investment builds on recent increases. In 2025, €84.9 million was allocated for current and capital expenditure for the benefit of young people, which was an increase in funding of €7 million, or almost 9%, on the 2024 budget. Of this, €500,000 in capital funding was allocated to strengthen youth service infrastructure. Over the period from 2021 to 2025, the level of current Exchequer funding for youth services and programmes will have increased by more than 34%.  The 2026 allocation will further strengthen the foundation for inclusive, high-quality provision by ensuring continuity, expanding reach and enabling services to respond to the evolving needs of Ireland's diverse youth population. It will also allow us to deliver on the ambitions in the Opportunities for Youth strategy, which provides a platform for an effective, data-driven and joined-up approach to the delivery of youth work and related services. Further details on the 2026 allocations for the Department will be available after the 2026 Revised Estimates Volume, REV, process is complete.  Oíche na hÓige, a pilot initiative of the Department of Education and Youth, took place on Friday, 21 November 2025 and saw youth clubs and projects around the country open their doors to the wider community. Participants used the opportunity to showcase their diverse youth services and facilities and the value of youth work in their community. The main purpose of the initiative was to celebrate and build community awareness of youth work services and youth clubs. It aimed to show the value youth work can bring to young people and to create opportunities for the further integration of youth clubs into their communities. I was delighted to see more than 400 youth clubs across the country participating in the initiative. \n Deputy Darren O'Rourke  Oíche na hÓige was a success. In my constituency of Meath East, I attended open nights held by Ratoath Foróige and 5th Meath Kells Scouts.  They do such good and important work in the community. In both of those projects, like so many, it is about youth leadership, with young people leading. Is it planned that Oíche na hÓige will be an annual event? Has that decision been made or is it under consideration? It is something I would support.  Are there plans to increase places for young people in youth work services? It is one thing to raise awareness and show people the good work being done but there are capacity issues in practically all these services because of a lack of investment over years. \n Deputy Michael Moynihan  It was a pilot event on 21 November. A number of short weeks later, the Department is currently evaluating the event. The Deputy is quite right and on the button that it was extremely successful. A lot of public representatives and community members attended the events and they were very successful. We are looking at how it can be improved. It has to be an annual event because of the benefit it brings to the communities. It also brings out our great resource, namely, young people. With Christmas fairs the length and breadth of the country in recent weekends, many young people have engaged in those. Some people involved in youth organisations have brought the expertise they developed in those organisations and the work they have done to the sales at the events. I have seen young people engaged in communities and it has been a success. We have to build upon it. \n Deputy Darren O'Rourke  It needs to be matched with increased funding. I said to the Minister of State at committee that youth services are the poor relation within the Department and in government. The incredible work done in communities and the benefit for young people and the wider community are immeasurable. Maybe that is part of the difficulty. Investment is returned in spades. Please continue to invest in young people and youth services and increase that investment.  I want to ask about the implementation plan for the national strategy for youth work and related services 2024 to 2028. We are coming into 2026 and that plan has not been prepared. It is an indication of delay and a lack of prioritisation. Please focus on it, deliver on it and, importantly, engage with the stakeholders doing such great work in our communities. \n Deputy Michael Moynihan  We have seen an increase in funding in the section. Youth services have seen an increase of €8 million in current and capital funding. Looked at within the overall budget of the Department of education, it appears small, but it is dedicated funding and is being brought back into that Department. There was always a huge collaboration between the Department of Education and Youth and the youth section of the Department of children. It is in its right home.  We have to build the strategy into the coming years and it has to be clear. We have seen in communities in Ireland and across the world divergence and difference being exploited. It is hugely important that we have integration at youth club level and in organisations that benefit from funding from this Department. I see in organisations I work with the benefit all this brings. I take the Deputy's point but there is significant investment in it.  On the strategic development, I will report back to the Deputy.

        "answerText": " Minister for Education and Youth  The Government is committed to increasing funding to support schools and the Programme for Government commits to increasing capitation funding to schools of all types to ensure that schools can meet day-to-day running costs. Schools have autonomy in their spending, allowing them to make decisions on spending independently at school level.  The Financial Support Services Unit (FSSU), funded by the Department, is an important source of advice and support to schools on financial matters, including budgeting and cashflow management. In circumstances where a school is in financial difficulty the Department requests the FSSU to carry out an evaluation of the financial position the school. The Department is committed to offering all available and appropriate supports to these schools, which may include an advance in capitation grant funding, or other measures, as appropriate.  As a result of such evaluations, a small number of schools required an advance in capitation grant funding to be paid to address immediate cashflow issues. The Department continues to liaise with the FSSU regarding supports and guidance to all schools.  In the 2023/2024 school year 31 schools were referred to the FSSU and 2 received an advance in capitation grant funding.  In the 2024/2025 school year 61 schools were referred to the FSSU and 17 received an advance in capitation grant funding.  In the 2025/2026 school year to date, 18 schools were referred to the FSSU and 9 received an advance in capitation grant funding.  The Department has secured €39 million in Budget 2026 towards increased capitation funding for primary, post-primary and special schools. The increases announced in Budget 2026 are in addition to the 12% increases as part of Budget 2025. The last three Budgets have resulted in an increase in the level of capitation grant rates of 49.7% (€91) paid to primary schools and 28.5% (€90) paid to post-primary schools.  The next capitation payments due to primary and post-primary schools will be paid in January 2026.  The Department is committed to offering all available and appropriate supports to schools experiencing financial difficulties, and advises any such schools to engage early with the Department and FSSU.

I very much value the vital role that the more than 23,000 special needs assistants (SNAs) play in the successful inclusion of students with special educational needs in our primary, post-primary and special schools.  The Special Needs Assistant (SNA) Workforce Plan remains a priority for my department and significant progress has been made to date. Research in preparation for the plan includes:  [ Focus groups with SNAs ]  [ Focus Groups with School Leaders ]  [ Focus Groups with Teachers ]  [ National Survey of Special Needs Assistants ]  Consultation with children and young people  Findings from this research provided valuable insight into the evolving role of the SNA and helped to inform proposals for the plan.  In addition, extensive collaboration and planning has been undertaken through working groups and stakeholder groups. This consultation is largely concluded and proposed actions have been developed. These actions must be carefully considered by my department and by the Department of Public Expenditure, Infrastructure, Public Service Reform and Digitalisation, before being approved for implementation. While it is not possible to be definitive on a publication date for the plan it is at an advanced stage.  The plan will reflect the evolved role of the SNA and will include measures to support SNAs and school communities in areas such as training, quality, recruitment and retention. Work is progressing on related initiatives including updating key circulars, a review of the SNA employment contract, and the development of a redeployment scheme.  I remain committed to ensuring that SNAs continue to be supported to effectively meet the needs of children and young people with special educational needs in our schools. ",

Challenges in relation to the diversity of the teaching profession have long been recognised, and the programme for government commits to increase diversity within the teaching profession.  My Department, with the Department of Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science (D/FHERIS) and the National Tertiary Office, intend to launch a new tertiary pathway for primary teaching in February 2026, with an initial intake of students in September 2026.  Tertiary programmes, first launched in July 2023, are a new kind of educational provision which allows a student to begin a degree course in further education, before transitioning on to complete their degree in a higher education setting. They are a key part of D/FHERIS's efforts to create diverse and progressive pathways in the third level system.  The tertiary pathway for primary teaching includes a one-year foundation course delivered by certain Education and Training Boards, aimed at widening access for candidates facing barriers such as socioeconomic disadvantage.  Successful completion guarantees entry to an accredited primary teacher education programme. Graduates will complete a “1+4” structure, ensuring readiness to qualify as primary teachers.  The objective of this programme is to provide an initial teacher education (ITE) programme that continues to meet the requirements for registration, while enabling those who have the capacity to become a primary teacher to overcome the barriers to entry that currently exist. Additionally, my Department is also considering the possibility of developing a tertiary pathway in post-primary teaching.  My Department frequently consults and engages closely with stakeholders on issues such as the diversity of the teaching profession through industrial relations forums, sectoral meetings, and direct discussions with teacher unions.  I am considering further measures to strengthen the teaching workforce and ensure that schools have the support needed to provide an excellent education for every student. ",

Closing this gap is a key Government priority. In September 2025, my colleague, the Minister for Children, Disability and Equality, launched the National Human Rights Strategy for Disabled People 2025–2030, which commits to substantially reducing the employment gap between disabled people and others in work.  As Minister of State with responsibility for Further Education, Apprenticeship, Construction and Climate Skills, my focus is to ensure that disabled learners have access to quality tertiary education that equips them with the skills needed for employment.  Apprenticeships play an important role in achieving this because apprentices are employees as well as learners. At least 50% of training in all national apprenticeship programmes takes place in the workplace, combining practical, industry-relevant experience with formal education. This approach builds technical expertise while developing essential skills such as communication and teamwork.  Minister Lawless and I have prioritised investment in apprenticeships and the expansion of public service apprenticeship opportunities to create meaningful career pathways for people with disabilities in the workplace, including in the civil and public service.  Expanding access to apprenticeships is a core goal of the Apprenticeship Action Plan. To advance this, the Access and Inclusion Sub-Committee of the National Apprenticeship Alliance will finalise guidance in 2025 to help employers create disability-inclusive workplaces.  Education and Training Boards also partner with Specialist Training Providers to offer training to disabled learners who are experiencing exclusion and labour market disadvantage.  Supporting people with disabilities remains a priority. Building on learnings from my Department's National Disability Symposium last October, we will launch a Disability Demonstration Project to explore education transitions, student supports, and work experience opportunities for disabled people.

        "answerText": " The Taoiseach  I propose to take Questions Nos. 1 to 11, inclusive, together.  The Government is committed to the delivery of a national security strategy and work is ongoing in finalising the strategy, co-ordinated by the national security secretariat in my Department and integrating inputs from a range of relevant stakeholders, including the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, the Department of Defence, the Department of Justice, Home Affairs and Migration, An Garda Síochána, the Defence Forces and the National Cybersecurity Centre.  The programme for Government, securing Ireland's future sets out a number of national security commitments, acknowledging that this is a time of upheaval, in particular geopolitical upheaval, with threats and challenges arising from a rapidly changing global geopolitical landscape. The preparation of a draft strategy covers a broad range of national security issues. There is necessarily a focus on the State’s internal security, including the evolving challenges we face from terrorism and extremism and from cyber threats, and a focus on the need to increase our investment in security and to modernise our legislation in the security field, notably in the investigatory powers available to our services. It will include also the implications of recent security, defence and international developments and their related impacts, notably the deteriorating security situation in Europe given Russia's ongoing war in Ukraine and the growth in cyber and hybrid threats in Europe. It will combine an enhanced maritime domain awareness with a prioritised focus on ensuring protection of critical maritime infrastructure, especially critical undersea infrastructure. The ongoing implementation of the report of the Commission on the Defence Forces and the modernisation of aspects of our defence legislation is also included in the preparations.  The National Cyber Security Centre has been placed under the remit of the Minister for Justice, Home Affairs and Migration. This is an important element of the realignment of our national security infrastructure, and a project has been initiated to establish this new statutory national security authority, led by the Department of Justice, Home Affairs and Migration. Earlier this year, I established the Ministerial Council on National Security, which comprises me as chair, the Tánaiste, the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade and for Defence, and the Minister for Justice, Home Affairs and Migration. The council will ensure that at the highest level there is a structured, ongoing review of our strategic national security interests and systematised monitoring of progress on delivering the Government’s commitments over the coming months, including the finalisation of the draft national security strategy. \n Deputy Tom Brabazon  As the Taoiseach is aware, drone sightings in Dublin Bay during the recent Zelenskyy visit underline and underscore the scale of our vulnerabilities and the urgency and need for preparing a strategic national security package. There are reports that international anti-drone units were deployed to Dublin during the visit to assist the emergency response unit. While we welcome the assistance of other states, we should not have to rely on others for our own defence. We should be self-reliant in the first instance. It should be expected that such activity will continue when Ireland takes over the EU Presidency next year, and a national security strategy would allow us to assess risks facing the State, including emergency aerial and technological threats, and set clear goals to guide Government and law makers. Can the Taoiseach provide an update to the House on the development of Ireland's national security strategy and an update on the drone sightings during the Zelenskyy visit? \n Deputy Albert Dolan  When we are talking about national security, it is vital we also give people confidence at a local level in our local security, particularly with regard to An Garda Síochána. In Galway East we have towns that are booming, thriving and growing such as Gort, Loughrea, Tuam and Athenry. Those towns are all feeding into Galway city. They have seen massive population increases and for those people to feel secure in those towns, we need an increase in our gardaí allocation and our gardaí numbers. More importantly, as the populations continue to grow in these towns, we need gardaí that become community gardaí, that the people know and connect with and can build relationships with into the future. These gardaí will serve the area. Our gardaí on the ground right now are working really hard but they need to be supported to handle the large caseloads right across the country but particularly in Galway East, we need additional gardaí. \n Deputy Paul Murphy  Does the Taoiseach think there is any national security implications for the significant decline in basic civil liberties that is happening in Britain, such as the proscription of organisations of Palestine protestors like Palestine Action, the denial of the right to a jury in the vast majority of trials and what is happening with the Palestine protesters who are charged with nothing more than property damage and who have been held for over a year without trial and without access to bail? The consequence is there are now eight protesters on hunger strike for over 30 days. This is the longest, most significant hunger strike since the H-block hunger strikers. Their demands are minimal, namely, the right to a fair trial, the right to access bail, the right to access medical care in prison and for the ending of the proscription of Palestine Action. There is an almost total media blackout on this in Britain, leading people to suspect there is a so-called D-notice in relation to this. Is the Taoiseach concerned about the decline of civil liberties and the fact that people are forced to go on hunger strike in Britain? \n Deputy Ryan O'Meara  Next year we will hold the Presidency of Europe. During that time, as the Taoiseach is more than aware, our national security will be of paramount importance. Given what has happened with drone activity and interference in Denmark, there is a fear the same will happen in Ireland. With President Zelenskyy's visit last week, we saw drones off the coast of Dublin. It is one thing for us to be a militarily neutral country, and that is right, but it is another thing for us to be able to say whether we can patrol our own skies and protect our own airspace. In light of the Presidency coming up in the middle part of next year, what will our national security strategy do? When will we see it? What will be in it regarding the protection of our skies and airports from rogue actors operating drones? \n Deputy Rose Conway-Walsh  The very serious incident of five drones endeavouring to intercept the plane carrying President Zelenskyy last week brought our unpreparedness on defence and national security into sharp focus. Was the C70 form completed to ensure that a Garda defence co-ordinated response was put in place? Were all protocols followed? Why did the navy ship not have drone-disabling equipment? Why were airlines not informed that there was drone activity in the vicinity into which they were flying?  Lieutenant General Rossa Mulcahy told John Mooney of The Sunday Times that the military needs more personnel, intelligence and high-tech capabilities to navigate these uncertain times. Why is the Taoiseach so reluctant to allow the defence and national security committee to do what its title suggests and have oversight of national security? \n Deputy Peadar Tóibín  Can the Taoiseach categorically say that the Government is able to protect all of the EU leaders who will come to this country during the EU Presidency? Who launched the drones that were seen off Dublin Bay during the Zelenskyy visit? Why were those drones not dealt with? Where did these drones come from? Where did they retreat to? How come none of that information is known at this stage? Who was behind the drones? We have heard statements that it is likely that they may have come from Russia, but what evidence is there of this? One of the more memorable answers the Taoiseach gave to a question on national security in the previous Dáil, when the issue of the so-called Russian spy was discussed, was that he did not receive those briefings. He quite pointedly said he did not receive the information he should be receiving on that. How can people in Ireland have confidence, given the fact that our Defence Forces have been run down for so long and we can only staff one ship on the seas at any given time? \n Deputy Paul Lawless  The national security strategy consultation launched in 2019 was intended to guide our strategy on security for the past five years, from 2020-25. Despite this, no strategy was published during this timeframe. During that timeframe we had a huge ransomware attack on the HSE which put a significant number of people's lives and health in jeopardy and cost the State several million euro. What is happening on this? When will the strategy be published? It is costing the State a significant amount of money. \n Deputy Ruairí Ó Murchú  We need some sort of detail and we need to know there is a plan to address cybersecurity and hybrid warfare. The HSE attack brought to light what was probably happening to a lot of businesses which did not provide information. There has been increased funding for the National Cyber Security Centre, NCSC, but we need to get down to brass tacks. There have been drone attacks over the past while and we need to make sure that we have the capacity and technological know-how to be able to deal with these issues. There has been a failure to date in respect of funding to ensure we have the full capacity required. \n Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett  One of the biggest atrocities and national security breaches was the Dublin-Monaghan bombing carried out by the Glenanne gang. There were headlines yesterday stating that there was no collusion in the Dublin-Monaghan bombing. First, the Kenova report yesterday dealt with Stakeknife, not the Dublin-Monaghan bombing. The Denton report will not be published until January. \n The Taoiseach  It was a summary of Denton. \n Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett  The report states that the British Army had the names of the killers on the night of the bombing but nobody was ever arrested. The representatives of the families think that smacks of collusive behaviour. The authors were also extremely critical of the Irish authorities, including the Garda, and the British authorities for destroying much of the files and evidence so that the people compiling the report could not gather conclusive evidence. The whole thing stinks to high heaven. The representatives of the families have asked for a public inquiry. Will the Taoiseach listen to them? \n The Taoiseach  I thank all Deputies who raised issues in terms of national security and the national security strategy. It reflects a growing awareness and engagement with this House, not before time, in respect of security and defence issues. There has been a wilful ignoring of these issues for far too long in the House. Particular perspectives have been taken on this. Even this morning, there were references to the United Kingdom, Europe or America as being threats. The clear threats right now in this era include a Russian threat to our security and security infrastructure. We have had engagement between Iran and Russia and North Korea and Russia. North Korean soldiers have been on European soil during a period of war, seeking to violate the territorial integrity of Ukraine and its sovereignty. These are the realities we face. We wish we were not facing these realities and we would prefer a Continent at peace and so on.  The strategy will be completed. Deputy Brabazon was the first to speak and referred to self-reliance. We will develop radar capacity, and that is very close to action in terms of procurement – a lot of work has gone into that. We need to co-operate and co-ordinate with other member states in the European Union and the United Kingdom in respect of all of these issues because a pattern has developed in terms of the emergence of these drones and the violation of the airspace of EU member states. The most notable incident occurred in Copenhagen at the time of the European Political Community meeting. Denmark sought help and advice from other EU member states at that time. There were incidents in Belgium, France, Poland, in terms of train tracks and so on, and in the Baltic Sea. We are agreed that, on the drone issue, disabling technology is important.  The visit of President Zelenskyy was very effective from a security perspective. I want to make it clear to everybody that an incident did occur on that night. A small number of unidentified drones were observed in the vicinity of a Naval Service vessel on patrol off the coast of Dublin. The drones were not a threat to President Zelenskyy's aircraft - that needs to be clear - because it had safely landed quite some time prior to the incident, nor were they a threat to his departure. An operational response was put in place that was appropriate to the circumstances by the commander of the naval vessel at the time and, subsequently, by the police and military authorities working in close co-operation. They worked closely together in advance of the visit and so on.  The Garda liaised with its Ukrainian partners throughout the visit of the President on the security arrangements, including with regard to this incident. The Garda special detective unit is carrying out an investigation of the circumstances of the incident with input from the Defence Forces. It is a very concerning incident, as I said, like other similar incidents in other European states. The circumstances are suggestive of this being part of an ongoing Russian-inspired hybrid campaign against European Union and Ukrainian interests. \n Deputy Paul Murphy  I would like the Taoiseach to present some evidence. He said the circumstances are suggestive----- \n The Taoiseach  Of course the Deputy would. Could I say to Deputy Brabazon----- \n Deputy Paul Murphy  The circumstances are contested. It might well have been the Russians but I would like to see some evidence if this will be used as an agenda to undermine our neutrality. \n An Ceann Comhairle  We just cannot have this, Deputy Murphy. \n The Taoiseach  The gardaí----- \n An Ceann Comhairle  We cannot have this interaction. \n The Taoiseach  I will come back to the Deputy. \n Deputy Paul Murphy  I thank the Taoiseach. \n The Taoiseach  An Garda Síochána is substantively enhancing and has enhanced its anti-drone capabilities. It has significant capabilities on land, and the navy likewise. The military generally has the capabilities throughout all three strands: air, sea and land. We will continue to enhance that and harness all technology available in the country, both private sector but also on our university campuses that can assist in that regard.  All politics is local and Deputy Dolan asked about gardaí in east Galway and the expanding towns. We have seen good progress in the recruitment of gardaí through Templemore. It has seen its highest intake this year. The Commissioner has been allocating significant numbers to given areas. Dublin benefited initially. Cork is benefiting now, to be quite frank, in terms of the city centre. The idea is to get around to the rest of the country but to do it in significant numbers so it really has impact. I understand we are pleading for patience on the Deputy's behalf and others but we are making progress. Funding is there to keep the throughput at the level it currently is in Templemore.  On the remarks made by Deputy Murphy, the United Kingdom does not present a national security threat to Ireland. \n Deputy Paul Murphy  The Taoiseach should have read the Denton report. \n The Taoiseach  On the issue he raised in terms of the civil liberties issue within the UK, it is an issue the UK has to challenge and deal with. I noted his comment, \"nothing more than property damage\". That was interesting. I do not believe people should be----- \n Deputy Paul Murphy  Interned for property damage. \n The Taoiseach  No one should be interned and there should be trials. I love the Deputy's casual approach to property damage. It is fine. It is grand. Do not worry about it. Let us continue doing it. \n Deputy Paul Murphy  That is not what I said. \n The Taoiseach  It is what he implied. \n Deputy Paul Murphy  No, it is not. \n The Taoiseach  Ah, come on. \n Deputy Paul Murphy  The point I was making is it is not normal to hold people----- \n The Taoiseach  We discussed this----- \n An Ceann Comhairle  Deputy Murphy made his point already. \n Deputy Paul Murphy  -----without trial for over a year for property damage. \n An Ceann Comhairle  We are not doing this, Deputy Murphy. We are not doing this. \n Deputy Paul Murphy  That is the point I was making and the Taoiseach knows it. \n An Ceann Comhairle  There are other Members to be regarded. \n The Taoiseach  Can I just say to Deputy Murphy that Deputies in this House have had their property damaged. I do not believe that should lead to internment or anything like that. \n Deputy Paul Murphy  Exactly. \n The Taoiseach  No, no. \n An Ceann Comhairle  Allow the Taoiseach to answer. \n The Taoiseach  Let us be very clear. In dealing with protest, there are different levels of protest. The right to protest and to free speech is absolutely inviolable. It has to be allowed and facilitated in any true democracy. When protests get too extreme, you then impact on other people's rights to personal safety, life and property. I respectfully suggest that is something the Deputy does not pay much attention to. \n Deputy Paul Murphy  Israeli weaponry property? No. \n The Taoiseach  In terms of the other issue Deputy O'Meara raised, I have dealt with some of the aspects of what happened on the night and so forth. In terms of the EU Presidency, which people have raised, there is a lot of work under way to prepare for that. An Garda Síochána is central to the security planning and preparation. It has established a dedicated European Union Presidency co-ordination office, led by the deputy commissioner of policing operations to oversee all aspects of operational planning, logistics and inter-agency engagement. There is ongoing interdepartmental engagement through a whole range of forums. Close co-operation with European policing and security partners concerning the Presidency is ongoing, as per the norm.  In the modern security arena, you have to co-ordinate, co-operate and share intelligence with other agencies. That is absolutely key. Otherwise, you are at nothing in terms of protecting the State or protecting our people. I do not want to go into all of the details here. Some of this is security sensitive. I have a report about the drone situation. When we are discussing security, there has to be an understanding there are limits to what can be put into the public domain. That impacts further gathering and garnering of intelligence. It also impacts on our capacity to withstand further threats and so on like that. There will be a lot of planning for VIP protection, venue security, transport management, cyber resilience and public order contingencies. All of that is being worked on. It is a mammoth task. It is a huge operation. Other member states have had to do something similar. It is symptomatic of where we are in terms of the threats to European security and so forth.  I think I have dealt with most of the issues Deputy Rose Conway-Walsh raised and I was responding to her in respect of that. \n Deputy Rose Conway-Walsh  Sorry, the Taoiseach has not----- \n An Ceann Comhairle  Absolutely not, Deputy. The Deputy has to take the answer. \n Deputy Rose Conway-Walsh  I just want to put it on the record the Taoiseach has not answered. \n The Taoiseach  I am not finished yet. No member state yet, bar France in the past 48 hours or so, has attempted to disabled drones or bring them down, for different reasons. That is a matter we have to leave to the operational people in charge. We cannot dictate that sort of a response here. \n Deputy Rose Conway-Walsh  Do we have the capacity? \n An Ceann Comhairle  Deputy, no. \n The Taoiseach  We have the capacity. \n An Ceann Comhairle  If the Deputy needs to raise a Topical Issue, she can put one down. This is not a back and forth. \n The Taoiseach  Once again, it is a matter for those on the ground and in the theatre to decide the best and most appropriate response at the time.  I have dealt with some of Deputy Tóibín's questions. The national security council has been established. There is a clear structure emanating from that in terms of awareness, being briefed and so forth. I was briefed on this incident. I sought a briefing immediately on it and I received it. Obviously, it is something that will be discussed at the national security council later.  In terms of Deputy Lawless----- \n Deputy Peadar Tóibín  The Taoiseach has not categorically----- \n An Ceann Comhairle  No. If the Deputy is not happy with the answer, put down----- \n Deputy Peadar Tóibín  -----stated that EU leaders will be safe during the Presidency. \n An Ceann Comhairle  Deputy Tóibín, you know you are wrong. \n Deputy Peadar Tóibín  He also has not stated where those drones came from and where they went. \n An Ceann Comhairle  I am asking the Deputy to stop addressing the Taoiseach until he finishes his answers, \n Deputy Peadar Tóibín  He has not answered those questions. \n An Ceann Comhairle  The Deputy might not like the answer but it is the Taoiseach's answer. Do not interject again, please. \n The Taoiseach  I was just about to make the point in terms of the cybersecurity attacks. Sorry, we will protect those who are coming into this country. There is no question. Do not always be so fast to denigrate ourselves. Do not listen to all the noise out there. What happened during President Zelenskyy's visit was a good security operation by our Defence Forces and by an Garda----- \n Deputy Peadar Tóibín  Why will the Taoiseach not answer the question about the drones? \n An Ceann Comhairle  Deputy, please have respect for the other Members. \n The Taoiseach  Through the Chair, we need to acknowledge that and the very effective work of An Garda Síochána and our Defence Forces. There is a lot of noise which suits other interests to portray Ireland in a certain light. The Deputy should be wary of that, too.  Deputy Lawless raised the issue of cybersecurity. Cyber threats and attacks have increased significantly since the Russian invasion of Ukraine. Some have been by criminal elements, some have been by professionals. There are also third party state actors in respect of cybersecurity threats. It is a very serious issue for both public utilities and private sector companies. It is costing a lot of funding to deal with that. We have brought the National Cyber Security Centre under the Department of justice. It is a very strong centre and has grown in capacity very significantly in the past five years. I remember when we started it. It has developed a really strong capacity under Richard Browne. Credit needs to be given in respect of that.  I make the point to Deputy Ó Murchú that there is not a failure in funding, frankly, and finance will not be an issue here. What is an issue is the procurement timelines, both within the European defence industry and more generally. We are working to see if we can accelerate procurement. We are doing that with the radar. That is why we took a joint country approach to procurement - to fast track it. In other words, we use the experience and expertise of countries that have experience of procuring the radar we are now seeking. Everyone will be about how fast we can procure. It will also be about taking an intelligent approach in terms of what we procure. The nature of modern warfare or security threats has changed radically. We are all witnessing the drone technology change, as well as the cybersecurity. What can we do undersea? How do we protect cables? How do we protect gas connectors? It is a whole-of-society security approach that is required here. It is not the traditional, conventional approach to defence and security. We need to consider and explore that point more, perhaps.  On the Dublin-Monaghan bombing, Deputy Boyd-Barrett is correct insofar as the summary of the Denton report was produced yesterday. It is regrettable that we do not have the full Denton report. I think there was some legal action taken to try to prevent it being published in full. The Kenova report has been published. We should have a debate on the Kenova report in this House in the new year. It reveals very sordid activity by state actors but also by paramilitaries, including the Provisional IRA. The Kenova report does not pull its punches in saying it was a threat to its own community or attacked its own community. What went on is quite unbelievable.  The Denton report stated that 120 people were murdered by a network of loyalist paramilitaries and RUC and UDR personnel, including those killed in the Dublin-Monaghan bombings. It is a very sordid story and both the Kenova and Denton reports cover it. I pay tribute to Jon Boutcher, who is now the head of the PSNI, for his leadership on Kenova, and also to Iain Livingstone. They withstood a lot of pressure. We will have two comprehensive reports, if we can get the latter one published. \n An Ceann Comhairle  That is it, Taoiseach. We move to questions Nos. 12 to 28, inclusive. With 16 Members and a remaining 18 and a half minutes, it is highly unlikely we will get to the third group of questions. I ask Members to be brief. ",

        "answerText": " The Taoiseach  I propose to take Questions Nos. 12 to 28, inclusive, together.  The Cabinet committee on infrastructure last met on 3 November and will meet again early in the new year. The Cabinet committee works to drive infrastructure delivery and the implementation of the revised national development plan. As Members know, last week, we brought to Government the essence of that plan. The reform of the delivery of critical, growth-enhancing infrastructure is a key commitment in the programme for Government. Last week marked a major milestone on this agenda with the publication of the accelerating infrastructure report and action plan.  This plan sets out 30 high-impact and time-bound reforms to speed and scale up delivery of homes, roads, public transport, wastewater plants and energy infrastructure. Actions include legislative reforms to balance individual rights and public good, simplify regulation and consenting systems, cut administrative burden and red tape and build public acceptance and a delivery culture. The reforms align with broader housing, climate and competitiveness goals. These will be achieved by streamlining approvals to allow concurrent processing, introducing statutory timelines for major project decisions, rationalising delivery guidance to reduce duplication and complexity, enhancing procurement practices through clearer project pipelines, and fostering a delivery-focused culture that balances safeguards with urgency.  We are at a critical juncture. We have a strong economy and growing population, but our infrastructure delivery is too slow. We have a once-in-a-generation opportunity to transform this. The Government, private sector and communities must align behind delivery. The plan is underscored by the largest capital investment in the history of the State, with over €275 billion planned over the coming ten years.  Over recent weeks, Departments have published their ambitious sectoral investment plans for the next five years. Areas such as energy, transport and water will see a significant scale-up in funding and delivery, all of which will support us to address our infrastructure deficit and scale up housing. There will also be robust oversight of the Government’s performance in achieving these actions with regular reports on progress to the Cabinet committee on infrastructure. In the period ahead, the Cabinet committee will, therefore, oversee both the investments and reforms required to ensure that infrastructure is delivered as efficiently and quickly as possible. \n An Ceann Comhairle  There are 12 Deputies present. They will have 30 seconds each, which means there will be six minutes for questions and six minutes for a response. That is as fair as I can be. \n Deputy Aindrias Moynihan  The recently published national development plan update sets out an ambitious plan for key infrastructure for the years ahead. Many of the capital works are due to get under way by 2030 and others thereafter. Having a pipeline of projects ready is vital because there is so much background work involved with them. I am particularly focused on the ones after 2030. We have seen how the N22 Macroom bypass took many years to advance through the earlier stages, such as the background works, planning and design and so on. The next phase of that road is the piece between Macroom and Ballincollig. It needs to continue in the background and get through the various background stages so that we have a pipeline of projects ready to roll as soon as possible. \n Deputy Ruairí Ó Murchú  We have all seen a huge amount of flood damage and the danger of nature. While a huge amount of work has been done by local authorities and emergency services, this brings to light the need to deal expeditiously with CFRAM protections that are necessary throughout Louth. With regard to the south part of the Dundalk and Blackrock project, the promise is quarter 2 of 2027 for planning application submission. There have been promises and we have been waiting years. \n The Taoiseach  Is that CFRAM? \n Deputy Ruairí Ó Murchú  It is CFRAM. There are five particular projects throughout Louth, in Drogheda, Carlingford, Greenore, Baltray and Ardee. The lack of wastewater capacity is also causing issues. \n Deputy Albert Dolan  We need to double-track the rail line from Galway city to Athenry. The passing loop at Oranmore is under construction now. Ceannt Station is moving to be a station with five platforms. Huge investment has gone in but we must continue it because we are going to wait years for the Galway city outer bypass and the reality is that rail is the lever we can pull. We can build a double track from Athenry to Galway city which would greatly improve the quality of life for all commuters in east Galway. \n Deputy Darren O'Rourke  We need updated wind and solar farm guidelines. The wind farm guidelines are in draft form since 2019 and the last full version was in 2006. There is a commitment in the programme for Government for solar farm guidelines but recent responses say they are at a very early stage of a scoping process. When will they be ready? \n Deputy Paul Murphy  The new roll-out of BusConnects routes has been a disaster in my constituency. Constituents report that buses on the F spine route, which were supposed to provide a more direct route to the city centre and greater connectivity, are taking 20 to 30 minutes longer to get into town and providing fewer options for people trying to get to work or school. It is made worse by the frequent delays and cancellations seen across nearly all routes in Dublin South-West, including the S and W spines operated by Go-Ahead Ireland. Elsewhere, the NTA has been forced to change routes in Finglas and Chapelizod due to protests and people making their voices heard. Will the NTA do the same here or will people be forced to protest? \n Deputy Séamus McGrath  Central to a good infrastructure system is a good public transport system. I welcome the approval of BusConnects Cork by Cabinet to proceed to the planning phase. That is very welcome but we cannot wait years for improvements to the local bus service. I am sure the Taoiseach, like other public representatives in Cork, is inundated with unreliability issues relating to local bus services, such as buses not turning up, disappearing buses and inaccurate information on the travel app. It is simply not good enough and it has been going on for years. People are tired of excuses from the National Transport Authority and Bus Éireann. I ask the Taoiseach to please take this issue up and look for immediate improvements. \n Deputy Tony McCormack  While we prioritise electricity, water and transport, digital connectivity must now be treated equally. It is essential for Ireland's competitiveness. Europe has fallen behind the US and China. 5G stand-alone is under 2% in the EU and 0% in Ireland, compared with 20% in the US and 80% in China. AI, ehealth and advanced manufacturing cannot run on yesterday’s networks. If we want future investment in next-generation technology, connectivity must be prioritised. Will the Cabinet committee on infrastructure evaluate 5G stand-alone as a national priority? During Ireland's EU Presidency, will the Government push for strong, pro-investment digital policy under the digital networks Act? \n Deputy Peadar Tóibín  The Navan to Dublin rail line is not included in the national development plan review as a project that will start to be built before 2030. It has no start date for construction at all at the moment. It is up to a future government to fund the construction of a Navan to Dublin rail line. No money has been assigned or ring-fenced for that particular project, despite the fact there are 90,000 people commuting from Meath at the moment, 60,000 of whom travel by car and add to the M50 crisis. The M50 is currently grinding to a halt. If the Government wants to help fix the M50 crisis, allow people in Meath to use public transport to get to work without pushing them into cars every single day. \n Deputy Paul Lawless  Ireland faces an emergency crisis in terms of infrastructure, housing, energy and water. According to the ESRI, an additional 40,000 construction workers will be needed for the housing plan and an additional 40,000 will be needed for infrastructure. That is 80,000 construction workers who are required to meet the Government’s plan. Indeed, the Dublin metro will require 8,000 construction workers. What is the Taoiseach’s plan in order to achieve this? I speak to construction workers in Australia all the time. They want to come home but they are simply totally disenfranchised and disengaged. The Government has no interest in bringing them home. \n Deputy Rose Conway-Walsh  I know the Taoiseach will agree that the people in Mayo deserve to have proper road infrastructure. I want to specifically talk to him about the R312, which is the main road connecting Erris to the county town of Castlebar. I want it to be designated a regional strategic road because that is the only way it will get the funding it needs. It is a dangerous road. People have put up with it for years but it is time for it to be fixed. \n The Taoiseach  Which one is that? \n Deputy Rose Conway-Walsh  It is the R312. I thank the Taoiseach. \n Deputy Barry Heneghan  Ba mhaith liom ceist a chur ar an Taoiseach faoin flooding we saw in Clontarf yesterday. I thank the Minister of State, Deputy Boxer Moran, for coming down and sorting out the dreaded sandbags, but households and businesses were very worried yesterday. I had tens of people----- \n The Taoiseach  Where was that? \n Deputy Barry Heneghan  Clontarf. Does the Taoiseach not know I am a Clontarf man? The flood defence is critically needed. Will flood defences be included in critical infrastructure with the recent announcement last week? This needs to be fast-tracked and people and businesses need assurance. \n An Ceann Comhairle  Finally, Deputy Conor D. McGuinness. \n Deputy Conor D. McGuinness  Once again, I am raising with the Taoiseach the N25, which is the transport spine of Waterford's infrastructure and long regarded as the most dangerous national road in the State. There has been no funding for safety improvements. Routine maintenance, resurfacing and line painting are not good enough at this stage. Bus stops are being withdrawn. There was another HGV incident this morning just outside Dungarvan. We need to see serious investment in safety improvements on the N25 right from Rosslare to Cork city, but particularly in Waterford where there has been no funding for safety improvements. \n An Ceann Comhairle  Taoiseach, the floor is yours for five minutes. \n The Taoiseach  I love the demarcation lines. The \"Rosslare to Cork city, but particularly in Waterford\" part of it. I am sorry. I get it. Do not worry. \n Deputy Conor D. McGuinness  There have been no safety upgrades. There was a serious incident there this morning. \n The Taoiseach  It is just an observation. I will start with Deputy Aindrias Moynihan, who made a very good point. Hopefully, with this national development plan and the allocation of ten years, we will avoid this stop-start where we get a project from A to B but C is not provided for at all. We had that over the last two decades, I suppose. I recall how the Cork-Limerick road had planning in an earlier era and then that was all shelved after the financial crash and so on. If they had kept the planning going, they would have been in a much better position now to actually start. I do accept that, and particularly on the N22. The Macroom bypass has been extremely effective but there is the problem that you go along a great road into Ballincollig if you are coming from the Kerry side but then you are suddenly into what, as the Deputy was saying to me the other day, is like a parking lot for the next 20 to 40 minutes. It is a very good point that we should encourage Transport Infrastructure Ireland, TII, and others to keep thinking of the next stage and to have the planning ready and preparatory work done. I will work on that particular stretch the Deputy has referenced.  Deputy Ó Murchú raised the flood damage, CFRAM and the five projects in Louth. Deputy Barry Heneghan had a similar point. In general, flood protection schemes take a long time. Some of that is due to stakeholder engagement and public engagement, and there can be objections and so on. If any projects are of such imperative, these are. We do know that when these projects happen, they are effective in protecting against flooding. Towns that had historical flooding events have stopped them because of good infrastructure being put in. These projects invite a lot of objections. We had it in Cork city and it went the whole way to the top courts. It is only now that work is under way and all of that. There was flooding in Cork city this week. It was there because of the tidal levels, but one could argue that if you had the protections in, then businesses and people would have been protected and people could have gone in and out of town. I am very conscious of that.  With regard to Deputy Dolan's question, I will come back to the Minister. It was a good point. I do no know where we are on it in terms of the national development plan but there is no question that Galway city is facing enormous congestion, including all the areas feeding into Galway city. It is a real problem. Public transport, including rail, does give us an option, but not the whole option. We have to get the ring road done. Equally, though, the rail infrastructure is critical. I will talk to the Minister for Transport, Darragh O'Brien, about that.  Deputy O'Rourke raised the issue of the updated wind farm guidelines. The Deputy is correct that they have been a long time coming and technology has changed in the intervening period. I have asked the Minister, James Browne, to accelerate the work on the guidelines. The unit in his Department is also working on planning exemptions. There is a lot of work there. The Department is also working on rural guidelines for housing and one-off housing. There is a lot of work in that Department but I accept that we do need to bring this to a conclusion. At some stage, we need some collective debate on energy. We are all dealing with individual cases of objections to solar, objections to gas generation, objections to wind onshore, and objections to wind offshore potentially. We desperately need the offshore wind. This is something we have got to progress through planning. I am hoping we can get wind farms built, certainly through 2030 to 2031. If we do not, then we are in trouble from an energy perspective. As a collective - when I say \"collective\", I mean the entire Oireachtas - we have to try to stand back and say that there are huge challenges. We discussed security earlier. We are very dependent on the importation of fossil fuels through the interconnectors. There are real issues here that we need to be clear-eyed about. We can then take decisions once everybody realises that there are pluses and minuses in all of this.  Deputy Paul Murphy raised BusConnects, which he said was a \"disaster\"----- \n Deputy Paul Murphy  Some of it. \n The Taoiseach  That is okay. It is a word that is not uncommon. Anyway, I have had my issues with BusConnects down through the years. There have been issues for habitual users of bus services who feel the changing of services or the reorientation of scheduling and so on has eroded what they would have had prior to it. Then we had all the issues around what were, in my view, over-the-top initial plans, which then got rolled back. This seems to have been a pattern throughout the BusConnects journey and I think lessons could be learned from that. A lot of heat built up that perhaps was not necessary in the first place because a lot of stuff that was proposed was then taken away. We will engage with the National Transport Authority, NTA, in terms of what is happening. It has made a lot of progress now on BusConnects. We need a good bus transport system.  That brings me to Deputy Séamus McGrath's point. Yes, I have heard similar reports in terms of reliability. Originally, a year and a half ago, the shortage of drivers was blamed, but we definitely need to improve reliability. There had been very good stuff happening in public transport growth and so on.  I will talk to Deputy McCormack again. The Deputy is absolutely correct that America, China and others are way ahead of us in some of this in the digital space. We need to catch up fairly quickly. I will look at the 5G stand-alone issue.  Deputy Tóibín mentioned the NDP. The Navan rail line is in the NDP review----- \n Deputy Peadar Tóibín  It is not a Bill. \n The Taoiseach  The Deputy has a great capacity. He is brilliant at it, actually. From a political agitation perspective, the Deputy has a great capacity to turn what others would see as success into defeat. For the Deputy in opposition to say that we are not releasing----- \n Deputy Peadar Tóibín  That----- \n An Ceann Comhairle  Do not interrupt. \n Deputy Peadar Tóibín  I have to, a Cheann Comhairle. \n An Ceann Comhairle  No, Deputy Tóibín, do not even dare. \n The Taoiseach  The Deputy is trying to ask how I can----- \n An Ceann Comhairle  Deputy Tóibín will have to look for it afterwards. \n The Taoiseach  I spoke to the Minister, Deputy O'Brien, about this and he is very clear that the Navan line is going ahead. \n Deputy Peadar Tóibín  There is no date for construction. \n An Ceann Comhairle  Do not even think about it. \n The Taoiseach  The Government is absolutely committed to it.  On Deputy Lawless's question, there is a huge increase in apprenticeships. We are recruiting people back. We are anxious for people to come back into the country, and people are coming back into the country. The construction industry is confident enough in terms of the numbers for getting the housing done, for example, and the huge retrofit programme that is going on as well.  I will talk and engage with the Minister in respect of Deputy Conway-Walsh's query on the R312.  Regarding Deputy Heneghan's question, I have discussed that in terms of Clontarf and flood relief generally. It will be part of critical infrastructure, absolutely. I see it as critical infrastructure because it is a big threat to us. The storms are worse and they are more severe. We need to accelerate the protection of people, households and businesses in that respect.  On the N25, we need to get the bypasses along that road. That is a section of the road that definitely needs improvement.  I thank the Ceann Comhairle. \n An Ceann Comhairle  I thank the Taoiseach and Members. For future reference, if there needs to be back and forth, this is not the forum in which to pose a question. \n Deputy Ruairí Ó Murchú  In the review----- \n An Ceann Comhairle  We have a Dáil reform committee today at which it will be discussed. \n The Taoiseach  We need a bit of entertainment and lively engagement, too. \n An Ceann Comhairle  This is not the forum, Taoiseach.

The Coast Guard delivers maritime search and rescue through its own Units, contracted helicopter and aviation services and dedicated arrangements with the RNLI and independent rescue boat operators placed strategically around the coast to provide sufficient service coverage. A maintenance grant payment is only offered to those independent rescue boat operators to cover specific costs involved in the delivery of their services and particularly in support of the implementation of new Rescue Boat Guidelines, a common safety and operational standard for operators with declared status to the Coast Guard.  The Coast Guard does not currently have a requirement for maritime search and rescue services as delivered by Meath River Rescue and the Department is not in a position to provide them with funding.

        "answerText": " Minister for Climate, Energy and the Environment  I propose to take Questions Nos. 124, 126, 127, 128, 129, 131 and 161 together.  The National Energy Affordability Taskforce was established in June 2025 to identify, assess and implement measures that will enhance energy affordability for households and businesses. The first Report of the Taskforce was published last month. This Report analysed recent trends in energy costs and related matters including arrears and set out a range of options for consideration as part of the Budget 2026 process. The CRU is a member of the Taskforce, fed into the Report and also presented data at a Taskforce meeting in relation to prices, arrears and details of CRU customer protection measures. Minutes of the Taskforce meetings are available at: www.gov.ie.  On foot of the announcements by suppliers of prices increases, my officials provided me with information on these price rises. This included a comparison of estimated annual bills across tariff years, the impact of government interventions in the form of electricity credits and the VAT reduction in preceding years as well as an approximation of the estimated annual bill incorporating supplier price increases. Much of the analysis provided by my officials was drawn from the Taskforce Report which is available at www.gov.ie . I also sought potential options from my officials for possible Budget measures. While these options were not progressed as part of Budget 2026, further consideration of the options will take place under the Taskforce next year.  Neither the Taskforce report nor submissions to the Minister included a recommendation to re-introduce universal or targeted energy credits. There are no plans to introduce credits this winter.  However, Budget 2026 did see the introduction of a number of measures to address energy affordability that more closely aligned with the Programme for Government including:  • A €5 per week increase in the Fuel Allowance bringing the payment to €38 per week. This equates to an increase of more than 15% and will provide an additional €140 to over 450,000 recipients during the annual fuel allowance season.  • This payment has also been expanded to include those in receipt of the Working Family Payment.  • Budget 2026 provided record funding of €558 million for SEAI residential and community energy upgrade schemes, an increase of €89 million on the Budget 2025 allocation to support delivery of the National Retrofit Plan. Research suggests retrofit measures can save a household up to €1,100 per year in terms of energy.  • The reduced 9% VAT rate on electricity and gas has been extended until 31 December 2030, to help contain household energy costs.  It is important to note that the Department of Social Protection can also provide support through the Additional Needs Payment to help households meet expenses, including those who face difficulties with fuel bills. There are also a range of CRU customer protections are in place including disconnection moratoria.  The Affordability Taskforce is now preparing for an engagement and consultation process to inform the development of an Action Plan to be published mid-next year. The Taskforce will also continue to bring an all of Government approach to researching and assessing options to enhance energy affordability for households and business.  In 2022, the ESRI estimated that the share of households that could be at risk of energy poverty was 29.4%. In order to improve the measurement of energy poverty, my Department funds the Research Programme on Energy Poverty, based in the ESRI. A key output of this Research Programme is the development of reliable and consistent metrics to monitor and study energy poverty. An ESRI publication on this matter is due to be published early next year.  Finally, I would like to reiterate the benefits of switching energy suppliers which can result in savings of hundreds of Euro on an annual basis. ",

        "answerText": " Minister for Transport  As Minister for Transport, I have responsibility for overall policy and exchequer funding in relation to the National Roads Programme. Under the Roads Acts 1993-2015 and in line with the National Development Plan (NDP), the planning, design and construction of individual national roads is a matter for Transport Infrastructure Ireland (TII), in conjunction with the local authorities concerned. This is also subject to the Infrastructure Guidelines and the necessary statutory approvals.  The National Transport Authority's (NTA) Greater Dublin Area Strategy does not envisage the progression of a Leinster Orbital Route in it's original form.  However, it proposed the provision of offline improvements in the existing road network to cater for orbital demand. It is important to point out that it is for the relevant local authorities, in the first instance, to engage with TII regarding the progression of any proposed national road project. All projects, including those listed in the NDP or any revision to the NDP, require statutory approval and compliance with the Infrastructure Guidelines.  Noting the above position, I have referred your question to TII for a direct reply regarding the development of improvements to the national road network which may facilitate orbital traffic. Please advise my private office if you do not receive a reply within 10 working days. ",
