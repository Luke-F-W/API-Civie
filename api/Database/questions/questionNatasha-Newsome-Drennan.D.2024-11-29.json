        "answerText": " Minister for Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science  Currently, 14 apprenticeship programmes require candidates to pass the Ishihara colour vision test, a standard diagnostic test for colour vision deficiency (CVD), before starting training. This has been the case throughout the lifetime of the standards-based apprenticeship approach, which was introduced in the 1990s. There is currently no exemption from this requirement, as all apprenticeships are national programmes, delivered and administered to a common national standard.  The following are the affected apprenticeship programmes:  • Painting and Decorating  • Plumbing  • Mechanical Automation and Maintenance Fitting  • Aircraft Mechanic  • Electrical  • Electrical Instrumentation  • Electronic Security Systems  • Instrumentation  • Refrigeration and Air Conditioning  • Agricultural Mechanics  • Motor Mechanics  • Construction Plant Fitting  • Heavy Vehicle Mechanics  • Vehicle Body Repairs.  SOLAS commissioned an independent report to consider this issue, which has now been completed. Following consideration of this report and its recommendations, SOLAS has advised my Department that it will revise the requirements for colour vision testing in early 2026, and that details of this change will be communicated clearly to employers and other key stakeholders before the end of the year.

        "answerText": " Deputy Albert Dolan  The current wind energy guidelines date back to 2006. In 2006, turbines were 80 m high. Today in east Galway, communities are fighting applications against 180 m industrial structures using rules from two decades ago. It is regulatory negligence to apply 2006 rules to 2025 technology. My argument is simple. The guidelines must protect people first, through strictly increased setback distances and noise regulation. Only then can we provide the renewables. We cannot continue to regulate modern monsters with obsolete laws. We need the update and we need it now. When can we anticipate the new energy guidelines? \n Deputy James Browne  I propose to take Questions Nos. 14, 39, 85, 532 and 533 together.  My Department is currently undertaking a focused review of the 2006 wind energy development guidelines which will inform a new national planning statement on wind energy under the new Planning and Development Act 2024. The review is addressing a number of key aspects of the guidelines including noise, setback distance, shadow flicker, community obligation, community dividend and grid connections. The key policy area here is with the Department of the Climate, Environment and Energy, which has primary responsibility for environmental noise matters and has been working to advance guidance on the noise aspect of the national planning statement, which is highly technical in nature. This work is now well under way.  In addition to work on the noise aspects of the national planning statement, the evolving policy and technical context including the new Planning and Development Act 2024 and the revision of the national planning framework reinforces the need to ensure that the finalised guidelines, once issued, are fit for purpose. In line with EU directive requirements, a strategic environmental assessment, SEA, is being carried out on the draft national planning statement as part of the review process. In this regard, my Department intends to undertake a public consultation on updated draft guidelines as part of the SEA process whereby all interested parties will have an opportunity to submit observations on the draft national planning statement. A finalised national planning statement will be prepared following detailed analysis and consideration of the submissions received during the consultation phase.  My Department is working towards concluding the finalisation of the national planning statement having regard to the intended public consultation and the impact of associated reforms and reviews including the revision of the NPF. The current 2006 wind energy development guidelines remain in force, pending the finalisation of that review. \n Deputy Albert Dolan  I appreciate the update and that the Department of energy and climate is working on the noise aspect. The speed at which this is dealt with is vital. Right now, there is a gold rush and a race to get planning applications through for these wind farms. I am speaking on behalf of the people of east Galway in Killimordaly, Barnaderg, Shancloon, Laurclavagh and Clonbern. There are 27 proposed wind farms in north Galway alone, with up to 150 turbines. The entire character of north Galway would be transformed if these were permitted.  Beyond the social impact, I need to raise the hard economic fact about the viability of these projects. EnergyCloud was before the committee last week. A total of €2 billion worth of electricity is being curtailed. This cannot be allowed to go on. It is not a sustainable model the way we are operating. \n Deputy Pádraig O'Sullivan  I support Deputy Dolan as well. I spoke about solar guidelines previously. It has to be said again that is taking an extreme amount of time to get these guidelines updated. I am here since 2020. I have spoken about this a dozen times at this stage. We have been led to believe that these guidelines are being updated or imminent. The Minister is giving us an update on the progress in relation to that. As I said, it seems to take an extreme amount of time. They are much anticipated and long awaited. Whether it is solar or wind, the only conclusion I can draw is that we seem to be putting things on the long burner. The only conclusion I can draw is that is being done by design by the Department to allow a number of applications. I am surprised to hear there are that many applications in one part of Galway. I thought that we had a heavy number of applications in my part of the country, but nothing comparable to Deputy Dolan's. We seem to do things very slowly. They seem to take an awful long time. I met the industry a number of weeks ago in relation to this. The industry wants these guidelines updated because it wants people to be aware of what is happening and it wants it done transparently. I echo the calls of Deputy Dolan to get this done urgently. \n Deputy James Browne  I thank both Deputies for their input in relation to the matter. In relation to my time in the Department of housing, there has been significant engagement with the Department of the environment in terms of developing the wider issues around the guidelines and in relation to updating them through the national planning statements. These are very technical in nature. They are very complex. There is considerable EU environmental legislation to take into account. Most importantly, there are also local communities to take into account. It is about finding that balance of where we can get to a situation where we can deliver and develop renewable energy while at the same time ensuring that local communities and individuals are respected within their local communities as well. This is not an easy balance to find. I have little doubt that if it was an easy balance to find it would have been done a considerable time ago. We are working very carefully, as I said, with the Department of the environment, whose policies are around ensuring that we have necessary renewable energy. I will be working with the Deputies as well and with the House to ensure that we can get that balance in place. \n Deputy Albert Dolan  Recently I had the privilege of walking one of the proposed sites in Shancloon near Caherlistrane in County Galway, where what was before me was beautiful open landscape. What amazed me was that this windfarm was proposed to be built on a bog. In order to build a turbine on a bog, a significant amount of peat has to be excavated in order to put in the concrete base to allow for the turbine to go up. The problem here is that this goes against everything we are working for environmentally; digging up bogs to put in wind turbines that ultimately have a useful life of maybe 30 to 40 years before they have to be considered to be taken down at that point. I also highlight that the engagement that happens in advance of these developments going to a planning process where a turbine farm is being proposed at 50 MW. That is the potential output of the turbines. As a result, those planning applications can go through directly to An Coimisiún Pleanála. The reality for a lot of these farms that are proposed is that their output will be a lot less than 50 MW and they should be going to the council first based on output, not based on potential capacity. That is something that needs to be hammered quickly because they are acting as if they are going to put out 50 MW when the reality is it will be a lot less. \n Deputy James Browne  I thank the Deputies for their concerns. There is a very large number of national planning statements that are now required over the coming years. Providing one under wind energy is a priority for the Department of housing, but as I said, many of the key principles are also within the Department of environment. We are continuing to work with it. It is about finding that balance where we can deliver renewable energy, which is absolutely critical for our environment - we are in a climate emergency - and ensuring that we meet the EU guidelines around the habitats directive, for example, and other directives, while also ensuring that the local communities are protected and respected. That is not an easy balance to deliver and arrive at. It is a difficult one to ensure that we can balance those competing interests. We have to ensure that we get this right, even if it does take a little bit longer than people might have hoped for. To ensure that we do not have a rushed answer is critical. ",

        "answerText": " Minister for Climate, Energy and the Environment  Government has committed to an ambitious target for indigenously produced biomethane by 2030. In response, my Department, in partnership with the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine, published the National Biomethane Strategy in May 2024.  Anaerobic digestion (AD), although a very well-established technology in Europe with over 20,000 plants in operation, is a relatively new and unknown technology in Ireland. Implementation of the National Biomethane Strategy is an on-going process of collaboration across key Government Departments and Agencies. The Biomethane Implementation Group has been established to oversee implementation of the strategy and delivery of the 25 key strategic actions to ensure the necessary infrastructure and supports are in place to underpin development of an indigenous biomethane industry of scale.  While anaerobic digestors, used to produce biomethane, can bring significant benefits to the communities and local environment in which they are located, they are also significant infrastructure which impact local communities. Priority deliverables under the strategy include developing guidance to support Local Authorities when assessing AD plants with planning applications. This action will be delivered through collaboration among relevant Departments and Agencies.  The Irish biomethane sector is already a well-regulated sector. Planning permission, licences and permits are required from a number of Agencies. Environmental licences are required from the Environmental Protection Agency, with the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine responsible for animal-by-product licences and feedstock regulation. Onsite health and safety and connection to the gas network are regulated through the Health and Safety Authority, the Commission for Regulation of Utilities and Gas Networks Ireland respectively.  AD and other integrated assets are required to undergo a full planning process to ensure proper consideration of a range of factors including location, visual impact, land-zoning plans, and ecology. Guidelines and requirements for these are currently set out through several acts, policy documents, spatial strategies, and development plans. Projects above a certain threshold are also required to complete an Environmental Impact Assessment. "

The person concerned submitted an appeal on 21st May 2024. Having considered all of the available evidence, the Appeals Officer found that it had not been established that the medical requirements for Invalidity Pension, as defined in the governing legislation, had been met.  The person concerned submitted a Section 317 request on the 2nd July 2025. The Appeals Officer having considered that review and the new evidence provided, did not find that the original decision was incorrect, and the review was subsequently disallowed on 14th October 2025.  This appeal has now been referred to the Chief Appeals Officer, in order to determine if a review under Section 318 of the Social Welfare (Consolidation) Act 2005, would be appropriate. ",

        "answerText": " Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine  The Agri-Climate Rural Environment Scheme, or ‘ACRES’, is the national agri-environment/climate measure provided under Ireland’s CAP Strategic Plan 2023-2027. The Government has committed over €1.5 billion to the scheme over its duration, the largest amount ever allocated to an agri-environment scheme.  The achievements to date under this scheme include the results-based scoring of more than 1 million hectares of agricultural land, the planting of 574,000 trees, the planting of 26,000 hectares with catch crops and the protection of almost 9,000 kilometres of watercourses under the Riparian Zone action.  As regards biodiversity, 7,200 hectares of land are providing a food source for birds throughout the autumn and winter, while just under 14,000 boxes have been built for barn owls.  There are currently just under 54,000 active participants in ACRES. As the scheme is at full capacity, there are at present no plans to open any further tranches for new entrants into the scheme. It should be noted that the regulations require that commitments must be undertaken for a minimum of five years, meaning that the remaining time period of the current CAP would not be sufficient to allow new entrants.  Payment rates within ACRES are calculated on the basis of additional costs, income foregone and transaction costs, as required by the regulations. These payment rates have been independently verified and approved by the European Commission.  The allocation of €280 million for 2026, as announced in the recent Budget, will be used to meet the current commitments of the scheme, including core payments, payments for Non-Productive Investments, Landscape Actions and ACRES training, and for the services of the ACRES Co-Operation Project Teams.

I fully recognise the pressures facing the tillage sector, not least the very challenging market outlook and downward price pressure this season, and I have recently engaged directly with the farming organisations to hear their concerns.  This Government recognises the importance of the tillage sector and wants to grow the area under tillage crops.  In recognition of the sector’s importance, my Department will be supporting the tillage sector in 2026 with funding of at least €50m through the Protein Aid Scheme, the Straw Incorporation Measure and a Tillage Support Scheme. Having secured additional funding in Budget 2026 for a Tillage Support Scheme, I intend to consult with stakeholders on its design and operation in due course.  In addition to commitments made in Budget 2026, my Department has provided significant direct supports to tillage farmers in recent years. This year, the budget for the Protein Aid Scheme was €10m, having increased from €7m to €10m annually from last year. Applications for approximately 66,000 hectares of cereals and oilseed rape straw were submitted for chopping and incorporating under the Straw Incorporation Measure this year, and I made the decision to pay all applicants under the scheme.  In February this year, I announced €32.4 million of payments under the Tillage and Horticulture Support Scheme, which was Government’s response to the difficult position tillage and horticultural farmers found themselves in due to exceptionally poor weather and continued high input costs last Spring.  The Farming for Water EIP has a budget of €60m to support targeted on-farm additional measures to improve water quality, including establishment of cover crops. This year, over 1,400 tillage farmers have expressed an interest in establishing cover crops under the EIP. The tillage sector is also being supported under other schemes, including the Tillage Capital Investment Scheme, ACRES and the Organic Farming Scheme.  The Food Vision Tillage Group report identifies opportunities to grow the sector and to further improve its environmental footprint. My Department continues to engage with stakeholders to progress the actions in the report, and as it is an industry report, it will require collaboration and sustained effort from all stakeholders.  I will continue to work with the tillage sector and provide targeted support where possible given the strategic importance of the sector within the wider agricultural industry. ",

        "answerText": " Minister of State at the Department of Education and Youth  The School Transport Scheme is a significant operation managed by Bus Éireann on behalf of the Department of Education and Youth.  The purpose of the Department's School Transport Scheme is, having regard to available resources, to support the transport to and from school of children who reside remote from their nearest school.  Under the terms of the Department’s School Transport Scheme, children are eligible for transport at primary level where they reside not less than 3.2 kilometres from and are attending their nearest national school and where they reside not less than 4.8kms from their nearest post primary school/education centre as determined by the Department/Bus Éireann, having regard to ethos and language.  Eligible children who complete the application process and pay or enter their medical card details on time will get a seat on a school bus service, if a service is available.  Children who are not eligible for school transport but complete the application and pay or enter their medical card details on time will be considered for any spare seats available after eligible children have been accommodated. These spare seats are called concessionary seats.  There may be more demand than availability for concessionary seats. In such cases, Bus Éireann will use a selection process to allocate tickets for the spare seats.  Temporary alleviation measures (TAMs) will continue for the 2025/26 school year at post-primary level. This means that, if there are available services and enough capacity, transport will be provided for concessionary pupils who are eligible for transport to their nearest school but are attending their second nearest school or post-primary centre. This is only if they apply on time and pay or enter medical card details on time.  Bus Éireann is responsible for the planning and timetabling of school transport routes. Bus Éireann endeavours, within available resources, to ensure that each eligible child has a reasonable level of school transport service in the context of the Scheme nationally. A minimum number of 10 eligible children residing in a distinct locality, as determined by Bus Éireann, are required before consideration may be given to the establishment or retention of school transport services, provided this can be done within reasonable cost limits.  The closing date for new applications for school transport services for the 2025/26 school year was Friday 25 April 2025. Any new applications made after the closing date are considered late applications and this may mean that a seat is not available.  The closing date for payment or entering medical card details was 06 June 2025.  Payments or medical card details submitted after the deadline date will be deemed late.  A late submission of payment or medical card details may mean that a seat is not available.  Bus Éireann will review applications/services over the coming summer months. Routes may be altered or extended depending on the number and location of eligible children who will be availing of school transport for the following school year. Once routes have been finalised, Bus Éireann will assign tickets for each school transport service. Tickets have begun to issue and will continue to issue throughout July and August.  Families who are unsuccessful in obtaining a seat will be notified via email and a refund will issue. ",

The data requested by the Deputy regarding the estimated timeframe for the completion of review of applications for CA is not readily available.  The time taken to conduct a review is dependent on the type of review being carried out and the information available at the time of the request.  Some reviews require more detailed investigation and interaction with the customer, and this can lengthen the timeframe of the review.  Schemes that require a high level of documentary evidence from the customer, particularly in the case of illness-related schemes, can take longer to process.  Similarly, means-tested schemes can also require more detailed investigations and interaction with the customer, thereby lengthening the decision-making process.  However, every effort is made to complete reviews as quickly as possible to avoid causing any undue stress to the customer.  If the Deputy has a particular case in mind, you might provide the relevant details so that my officials can examine the specific case.  The Department of Social Protection is committed to providing a quality service to all its customers.  This includes ensuring that all reviews are processed as quickly as possible. ",

Furthermore, equines that are registered late are automatically deemed ineligible for human consumption. This status can have a negative impact on an equine's welfare at the end of its life as it can mean a higher probability of neglect or abandonment.  For all of these reasons, my Department is committed to ensuring compliance with the requirements of equine registration. The preferred approach is to bring people into compliance quickly and collaboratively. Education and engagement are deployed as first steps rather than prosecution which is reserved for repeat offenders and more serious cases. In keeping with this policy, my Department has not taken any prosecution cases to-date for failure to register equines.  In recognition of the need to improve equine traceability as foundational to protecting equine welfare, Professor Patrick Wall was commissioned to carry out a root and branch review of our equine ID system. His report recommended several reforms to strengthen equine identification, traceability and welfare and I published an action plan to give effect to his proposals. My Department is working collaboratively with all equine stakeholders to action its recommendations and protect our equine population. I am positive that these changes will lead to a better system of traceability and improved welfare outcomes for all horses in Ireland. ",

ISD will contact the person concerned once a decision on their application has been reached.  All applications for a certificate of naturalisation are assessed individually in accordance with the provisions of the Irish Nationality and Citizenship Act 1956, as amended. A determination on whether an applicant satisfies the statutory criteria for naturalisation can only be made after an application is received.  Applicants are required to have 5 years reckonable residence in the State prior to making an application, except for spouses of Irish nationals where the requirement is 3 years. In all cases, the final 12 months must be continuous residence in the State with up to 70 days allowed to facilitate foreign travel for business family or holiday purposes.  Detailed information on how to apply for naturalisation and other resources is available on my Department’s ISD website here: https://www.irishimmigration.ie/how-to-become-a-citizen/  As an Oireachtas member, the Deputy can also request the status of individual immigration cases by e-mail, using the Oireachtas Mail facility at: IMoireachtasmail@justice.ie, which has been specifically established for this purpose.

Bus Éireann are reviewing services at present and tickets will be issued in the normal manner prior to the commencement of the 2025/26 school year based on eligibility criteria, as per below.  Under the terms of the School Transport Schemes, children are eligible for transport at primary level where they reside not less than 3.2 kilometres from and are attending their nearest national school, and at post primary level where they reside not less than 4.8 kilometres from and are attending their nearest post primary school/education centre as determined by the department/Bus Éireann, having regard to ethos and language.  Eligible children who complete the application process and pay or enter their medical card details on time will get a seat on a school bus service, if a service is available.  Children who are not eligible for school transport but complete the application process and pay or enter their medical card details on time will be considered for any spare seats available after eligible children have been accommodated. These spare seats are called concessionary seats.  There may be more demand than availability for concessionary seats. In such cases, Bus Éireann will use a selection process to allocate tickets for the spare seats.  Temporary Alleviation Measures at post-primary level have been continued for the 2025/2026 school year which means that transport arrangements will continue to be provided for a number of post-primary students who are attending their second nearest school, who have applied and paid on time and who live more than 4.8km from their nearest school.

In the current school year over 173,000 children – including 13,400 pupils with special educational needs - are transported daily in approximately 8,200 vehicles across 10,600 routes to primary and post-primary schools throughout the country.  As Bus Éireann manages the operation of the school transport scheme this includes the procurement tender process to include services provided by contractors under the scheme. This is a competitive procurement process conducted in accordance with the negotiated procedure under national and EU procurement legislation.  Bus Éireann are reviewing all new and existing applications for the 2025/2026 school year and will arrange transport in the coming weeks where responses allow.  The service, that the Deputy refers to, did not operate for the 2024/2025 school year due to procurement issues. Bus Éireann will continue to try and source a contractor to operate the service if one is required following the review of services for the 2025/2026 school year. ",

These figures are incorporated into the Department’s annual profile of expenditure and are monitored on a monthly basis both in terms of the Department’s monthly profile of expenditure and Bus Éireann information based on actual costs versus projected costs. Expenditure headings and profiles are discussed at monthly meetings held between the Department and Bus Éireann. Where changes in projected expenditure occur, a new year-end forecast is submitted by Bus Éireann and reflected in a revised spread of payments.  Actual expenditure is finalised in the Bus Éireann annual statement of account which is independently audited by the Bus Éireann auditors in accordance with the 1975 Summary of Accounting Arrangements. Balances, where they occur, are accounted for in the following year’s projected cost. ",

        "answerText": " Minister for Transport  In accordance with the provisions of Section 13 of the Roads Act 1993, each local authority has statutory responsibility for the improvement and maintenance of their regional and local roads. Works on those roads are funded from local authorities' own resources and are supplemented by State Road grants. Of these grants, the vast majority (approximately 90%) are targeted at the maintenance and renewal of the network with c. 10% of the remaining funding invested in new roads/bridges or for road realignments.  Any new road projects that seek State funding are assessed by the Department on a case-by-case basis. All projects proposed by local authorities for consideration must comply with the requirements of the Infrastructure Guidelines (formerly the Public Spending Code) and the Department's Transport Appraisal Framework. Given the limited funding available for regional and local road improvement works it is important for local authorities to prioritise projects within their overall area of responsibility with these requirements in mind.  In line with Government requirements Kilkenny County Council produced a Strategic Assessment Report (SAR) for the Kilkenny Northern Ring Road Extension and a draft was forwarded to the Department in January 2023. The Department reviewed the SAR and returned its comments and observations to Kilkenny County Council for consideration.  Since then, both the Public Spending Code and the Department’s Transport Appraisal Framework (TAF) guidance have been updated - the Department continues to liaise with the Council regarding new requirements under the new infrastructure Guidelines and the TAF including the preparation of a Project Outline Document (POD) and business case incorporating the work already undertaken at the SAR stage.  In 2024, the Department provided funding for an updated POD, which has been submitted to the Department by Kilkenny County Council, and while this process was underway funding was also allocated for Traffic/Junction Analysis in the Butts Green area of the City to further assess and understand traffic patterns in the city.  Following a review of the POD by the Department, €200,000 has been allocated to the Kilkenny Northern Transport Project (formerly Kilkenny Northern Ring Road Extension Project) in 2025 to allow Kilkenny County Council to progress the project to the Options Stage.  As regards the funding allocated to and drawn down for the Kilkenny Northern Transport Project, details of the regional and local road allocations and payments to local authorities are outlined in the regional and local road allocations and payments booklets which are available on the Oireachtas Digital Library.

All applications are processed in chronological order, based on date order of receipt.While every effort is made to process applications as soon as possible, processing times will vary having regard to the volume and complexity of applications, the possible need for the Immigration Service Delivery function of my Department to investigate, inquire into, or seek further information, and the resources available.Processing times and decisions at the Overseas Visa Offices can be checked at the following link:www.irishimmigration.ie/visa-decisions/#decisions. I am acutely aware that join family applications are very important for the persons impacted. I understand that people are eager to have their families join them in Ireland and I am committed to improving the service my Department provides. The person concerned can now directly check the status of their immigration application on the Immigration Service’s new Customer Service Portal. They can register for, or log in to their existing account, at: portal.irishimmigration.ie/en/.  As an Oireachtas member, you can also request the status of individual immigration cases by e-mail, using the Oireachtas Mail facility at: IMoireachtasmail@justice.ie, which has been specifically established for this purpose. This service enables up to date information on such cases to be obtained without the need to seek information by way of the Parliamentary Question process. ",

The staffing schedule operates in a clear and transparent manner and treats all similar types of schools equally.  The primary school staffing arrangements for the 2025/26 school year are set out in Circular 0011/2025.  These arrangements contain an appeals mechanism for schools to submit a staffing appeal under certain criteria to an independent Primary Staffing Appeals Board.  The school referred to by the Deputy was due to have one teaching post suppressed in September due to falling enrolments.  The school was successful in its appeal to the Primary Staffing Appeals Board and has been informed that it will retain its current mainstream staffing for the 2025/26 school year provided the school's enrolment reaches 45 on 30 September 2025.

Supporting documentation was received in the Tehran office on 24 November 2024. The application was received in the Dublin Visa Office on the 16 December 2024 where it awaits examination and processing.  It is not possible to give a definitive date as to when this application will be finalised. Applications are processed in chronological order, based on date order of receipt.  I understand that extended wait times can be frustrating for applicants, and I want to assure anyone who has made an application for a visa that my Department is doing everything possible to progress these applications as quickly as possible.  In 2024, approximately 201,000 visa applications, of all types, were received by the Visa Division of my Department. This reflects an increase of 21%, compared to 2023, with over 35,000 additional applications received. My Department's Visa Division is working to meet the increased level of demand and the number of decisions issued in 2024 increased by 18%.  While processing times can vary across the different Visa Offices and Irish Embassies, the majority of visas are processed within stated target times. However, some applications can take considerably longer. Processing times for all applications are influenced by a number of factors. The time it can take varies depending on the type and complexity of application; individual circumstances; peak application periods; such as holidays or the start of the school year; and, crucially, the quality and completeness of the application lodged.  Visa applications can only be determined when all the required information is received and considered by the Visa Office. This information is not limited to considering the documentation submitted by the applicant themselves. The Visa Office also must take steps to verify the details and/or documentation submitted in support of the application. These requirements are detailed in the privacy notice which all visa applicants agree to upon submitting their application.  Visa and preclearance applications provide legal avenues for people moving to Ireland for employment, study and family reasons and also to facilitate visitors who wish to travel for business and/or tourism. It is important to recall these applications are screening processes, designed to establish that the person has a legitimate reason to come to Ireland prior to travel.  Verifying an application is an important part of our immigration system and the checks involved can take time to complete. In recent months, additional resources and staff have been assigned to my Department’s Visa Division which I expect will reduce the waiting times for all applications.  While every effort is made to process applications as soon as possible, processing times will vary having regard to the volume and complexity of applications.  The applicant will be notified as soon as a decision has been reached by a Visa Officer.  Processing times and decisions at the Dublin Visa Office can be checked at the following link which is updated each Tuesday: www.irishimmigration.ie/visa-decisions/.  The date published on the above page is the oldest date of application currently being processed under a given category. However, it should be noted that the Visa team continue to process and make decisions on applications received after the published processing date. If a particular application takes longer to consider this may prevent the published processing date from advancing.  The person concerned can now directly check the status of their immigration application on the Immigration Service’s new Customer Service Portal. They can register for, or log in to their existing account, at: https://portal.irishimmigration.ie/en/.

The scheme is made up of three separate schemes, the school transport scheme for primary, post primary and for children with special educational needs. Transport is also provided for children who have arrived in Ireland from Ukraine and those residing in IPAS/EROC centres. The total expenditure on the scheme in 2024 was €512m.  The information required is not readily available in the format requested by the Deputy as costs are not attributed on a per county of school basis, and is dependant on the number of days operated on a per route basis. Routes can cover a number of schools in an area that may not be in the same county. The estimated total cost of providing school transport nationally including escort grant payments to schools, and Special Transport Grant payments to families is currently approximately half the overall school transport expenditure.  Under the terms of my Department's School Transport Scheme for Children with Special Educational Needs, children are eligible for transport where they are attending the nearest recognised school that is or can be resourced to meet their special educational needs.  The National Council for Special Education through its network of Special Education Needs Organisers (SENOs) acts in an advisory role to my Department on the suitability of placements for children with special educational needs.  A pupil with special educational needs is eligible for school transport if s/he is attending the nearest recognised: mainstream school, special class / special school or a unit, that is or can be resourced, to meet the child's special educational needs under Department of Education and Skills criteria.  Eligibility is determined following consultation with the National Council for Special Education through its network of Special Education Needs Organisers (SENO).  Parents should contact their school principal who will assist in making an application for school transport to the SENO that is affiliated with the school the child is attending.

On 20 June 2023, Government gave approval to commence the process of undertaking the First Revision of the National Planning Framework (NPF). The NPF is the whole-of-Government strategy for strategic planning and sustainable development of our urban and rural areas to 2040, with the core objectives of securing balanced regional development and a sustainable ‘compact growth’ approach to the form and pattern of future development.  The revision process was finalised and approved by Government and the Oireachtas in April 2025. The finalised revised NPF reflects the significant policy changes and other factors that have taken place since 2018, allowing the updated policy approach to be integrated into the planning system.  One such significant area of policy development relates to planning for climate change in the context of an accelerating climate crisis. Accordingly, the revised NPF has included new policies in relation to renewable energy development, including the identification of regional renewable electricity capacity allocations in order to facilitate the accelerated roll-out and delivery of renewable electricity infrastructure for on-shore wind and solar generation development and to support the achievement of the 2030 national targets set out in the Climate Action Plan.  Incorporating these targets and allocating same to the regional level within the revised NPF is specifically addressed in Section 7.5.4 of the Strategic Environmental Assessment (SEA) Environmental Report, published at draft and approval stage of the revision process. Included in this report is the comparison of identified scenarios to achieve the incorporation of the targets to a regional level, based on a number of considerations including grid connection availability and Just Transition, amongst others. Each of the alternatives were assessed against each of the strategic environmental objectives, which included population and human health, and the preferred environmental alternative was identified as it represented the most achievable, equitable, and environmentally acceptable allocation in the context of meeting the Climate Action Plan targets.  The preferred alternative was based on the examination of national vs. regional targets and of 5 spatial approaches, through the SEA process, Spatial Alternative 5 (Balanced Approach) was selected as the preferred alternative, reflecting a balancing of the above factors. The regional targets have been developed through a multi-criteria geospatial analysis carried out on behalf of SEAI and DECC, the methodology for which is set out in the SEA Environmental Report.  The revised NPF also acknowledges the clear link between climate action and the potential for investment generation and employment and jobs, including in connection with the offshore wind industry and green technology.

All motor vehicles must be registered within 30 days of their date of entry into the State.  When a new vehicle is purchased, the motor dealer registers the vehicle at the point of sale and VRT becomes payable. VRT is included in the purchase price of the vehicle. A motor trader may apply for a deferred payment arrangement under section 136 of Finance Act 1992 (as amended). Under this arrangement, payment of the VRT is deferred until the 15th day of the month following the month of registration of the vehicle. Such deferred payments are secured by means of a guarantee issued by a financial institution in the State. A used vehicle imported into the State must be presented for registration within 30 days of its date of entry into the State at the National Car Testing Service (NCTS). Revenue assigns a registration number to the vehicle, and this is issued to the person registering the vehicle by the NCTS on payment of the VRT.

The person concerned lodged an appeal with the SWAO and the Department received notification of this appeal and the Department submitted the appeal to the SWAO on 10 July 2024.  The SWAO notified the DA Section on 22 April 2025 that the decision was upheld and the appeal was disallowed.  The person concerned was notified directly by SWAO regarding their appeal.  An Appeals Officer’s decision is final and conclusive in the absence of any fresh facts or evidence.  It is open to the person concerned to re-apply for DA.  I trust this clarifies the position for the Deputy. ",
