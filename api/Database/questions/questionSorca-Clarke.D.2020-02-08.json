This is to enable the Defence Forces to carry out the roles assigned by Government.  In December 2024, a contract for the delivery of four Airbus H145M helicopters was awarded to Airbus Helicopters UK Ltd. with the aircraft being manufactured in Germany. This investment of €91.7 million ex VAT will provide a modern light-utility helicopter capability for the Air Corps. They will replace the present ageing fleet of two EC-135s, which have reached the end of their useful service life. Production of the helicopters is progressing well, and it is anticipated that delivery of the helicopters will begin on a phased basis in Q1 2027.  The Airbus H145Ms represent a modernisation and expansion of light-utility helicopter capability for the Air Corps over the present EC-135s, which have reached the end of their useful service life.  Full details of the contract award rationale are published and are available on the European Tenders Electronic Platform under contract award notice number 47059 - 2025. The legal justification for the contract award was underpinned by legal advice from the Office of the Attorney General and is in compliance with the provisions of the Defence and Security Directive 2009/81/EC.

The CODF recommended the development of a primary radar capability to ensure that Ireland can maintain a complete ‘Recognised Air Picture’, and that this should be an immediate and top priority.  There are three elements to the Military Radar Programme: Land based Long Range Primary Radar; Ground Based Air Defence (GBAD) systems, to include a Counter-Unmanned Aerial Systems (C-UAS) capability; and Maritime (ship-borne) Radar.  This programme of work is ongoing and good progress has been made.  When fully delivered, the Recognised Air Picture will incorporate this suite of military radar systems; which will have the capability to detect all aircraft traversing our airspace including any that may be operating with their transponders turned off.  My Department has engaged with a number of countries, including all EU Member States, to ascertain their interest in supporting Ireland to deliver this capability. Based on the responses received, my officials commenced bi-lateral discussions with a small number of countries earlier this year, with a view to assessing options for delivery.  This phase of the process recently concluded and the Preliminary Business Case for the Military Radar Programme has now been approved. This concluded that a Government-level approach with one country was the preferred option and, in line with this approach, my Department will now commence detailed negotiations with France on a potential agreement for the delivery of all capability requirements under the Programme.  Full delivery of the Programme will be complex; but has been prioritised with a target date of 2028 identified in the CODF Detailed Implementation Plan. That being said, elements of this capability will be rolled out in phases, starting in 2026, towards full delivery by the end of 2028. ",

In addition to the New Engineer Equipment store, the following projects have been completed at Custume Barracks to-date in 2025:  • Replacement Hangar for the Emergency Ambulance Service  • Band Hall Heat Pump Installation  In addition, my Department also allocates funding each year to the Defence Forces for the maintenance, repair and upkeep of its building stock. This year a devolved budget of €12.5 million was assigned by my Department to the Defence Forces for these tasks. The individual prioritisation of specific projects to be carried out is solely a matter for the Defence Forces in keeping with the delegated nature of this budget. ",

The Commission on the Defence Forces undertook a significant body of work, encompassing wide-ranging terms of reference in its report published in 2022. It recommended significant changes for the Defence Forces and Defence provision in Ireland. It covers high level Defence Forces structures, defence capabilities, organisation, culture and human resources, the Reserve Defence Force and funding.  There are a number of Government approved, Commission recommendations contained in the report which may impact on the structure of the Defence Forces including that the structure of the Army be reviewed, and in that context, the disposition of Units across the Defence Forces may be considered.  No decisions on the future disposition or locations of Defence Forces formations, installations and personnel have been made at this time.  In keeping with the recommendations of the Commission on the Defence Forces, the Defence Forces have established an office of Army Force Design and an overarching strategic force design office, which has begun to undertake the significant work required to give effect to this recommendation.  On completion of the force design work by the Defence Forces and other work, the Chief of Staff will submit a report on Force Design to me for review. This is complicated and challenging work which we need to get right to ensure that we design a modern force which is fit for purpose for future generations. ",

Following two public consultations, the Review’s Final Report was published in July 2024.  The Review's Final Report sets out 32 strategic recommendations to enhance and expand the rail system in Ireland and Northern Ireland up to 2050, aligning with net carbon zero commitments in both jurisdictions. The recommendations seek to transform the quality of the rail system to the benefit of passengers and wider society on the island, through additional track capacity, electrification, increased speeds, higher service frequencies and new routes.  Assisted by the European Investment Bank (EIB) Advisory Services, the Department of Transport and Department for Infrastructure, and agencies across the island, are working to progress the Report’s recommendations in the years ahead. As part of this work a Project Prioritisation Strategy was developed and published on 15th December.  The Strategy considers how best to optimise the sequencing and implementation of the Review recommendations, including both short-term interventions and longer-term projects. Amongst the early interventions called out in the Strategy are additional platforms at Sligo and Enfield on the Sligo rail line, as well as an additional track passing loop between Sligo and Boyle which will increase the resilience and capacity of the line in the short term. These recommendations will be delivered over the period 2026 to 2030, with funding provided in the National Development Plan (NDP) Sectoral Investment Plan for Transport, which was published by the Department of Transport in November.

        "answerText": " Tánaiste and Minister for Finance  Budget 2026 included a number of tax measures relevant to the Deputy's question. The  measures include the following:   Microgeneration of Electricity   Budget 2026 extends the exemption from income tax, USC and PRSI for householders for certain profits of up to €400 per annum from the microgeneration of electricity, for a further three years, to 31 December 2028. The estimated full year cost of the proposed extension is €10 million.   Extension of the VAT Reduction on Gas and Electricity   Ireland currently applies the second reduced rate of 9 per cent to the supply of gas and electricity. This measure was due to expire on 31 October 2025 and revert to 13.5 per cent on 1 November 2025. Budget 2026 extended this measure to 31 December 2030 by way of a Financial Resolution on 7 October 2025. The estimated full year cost of extending the 9 per cent VAT rate on the supply of gas and electricity is €254 million.   Extension of Vehicle Registration Tax (VRT) Relief for Electric Vehicles   Budget 2026 extends the Vehicle Registration Tax relief for electric vehicles by one year to 31 December 2026. The estimated cost of this tax measure, in respect of 2026, is €40 million.   Extension of the Rent Tax Credit   Budget 2026 extends the Rent Tax Credit by a further three years to the end of 2028. The estimated full year cost of this measure is €350 million.    Extension and Expansion of the Living City Initiative   The Living City Initiative is a targeted measure which is aimed at specific areas in need of regeneration, and includes measures to support owner-occupiers. The recent Budget address announced a number of enhancements to the scheme. The estimated full year cost of these measures is €25 million.   Mortgage Interest Tax Relief   Budget 2026 extends the Mortgage Interest Tax Relief, on a tapered basis, for two further years, to 31 December 2026. The current level of relief will be maintained for the increase in interest paid in the tax year 2025 over 2022, with a maximum tax credit of €1,250 per property available. The estimated cost in respect of 2026 is €25 million and, in respect of 2027, €13 million.  As the above tax measures are demand led schemes, it is not possible to set out the estimated cost on a regional basis.  Finally, the Budget 2026 Tax Policy Changes documentation sets out further details in respect of these measures and the other tax measures announced in the Budget.

        "answerText": " Tánaiste and Minister for Finance  Firstly, I would like to acknowledge the impact of the damage caused by severe weather events on families, communities, and businesses.  Climate change and its consequences is a constantly evolving issue and we are consistently developing our policies and working with multiple stakeholders to quantify, understand, and tackle this complex issue. In relation to flooding, the Government remains committed to protecting Ireland’s present and future generations by investing in climate adaptation measures to manage the impacts of extreme weather. Accordingly, €1.3 billion has been committed to the delivery of flood relief schemes over the lifetime of the National Development Plan (NDP) to 2030. This will protect approximately 23,000 properties across various communities from river and coastal flood risk. Nationally, 55 schemes have been completed, at a cost of €550m, which are providing protection to over 13,000 properties and an economic benefit to the State in damage and losses avoided estimated to be in the region of €2 billion.  The Department continues to engage with the insurance industry on all aspects of insurance reform, including flood cover issues. These matters are a priority for the Government and efforts continue to be made to encourage a responsive approach to the provision of flood insurance from the insurance industry.  According to EU level data, Ireland has an above average rate of flood cover relative to the EU. However, it is acknowledged that some households are still experiencing difficulties, particularly in areas with demountable flood defences which require varying degrees of human intervention in their installation. Where Government has invested in flood defences, it is the Government’s expectation that the industry should improve the level of cover in areas where flood defences exist. In order to address the issue of flood coverage levels in areas with demountable defences, continued engagement with all relevant stakeholders is key. This is facilitated through the Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) between the OPW and Insurance Ireland. Under this arrangement, the OPW provide information on all completed flood defence schemes (including on demountable ones) to Insurance Ireland, the representative body of the insurance industry. In turn, insurers take into account this information when assessing exposure to flood risk within these areas. Officials from the Departments of Finance; Housing and Local Government, along with other stakeholders engage constructively with this process on how the levels of insurance cover might be improved in areas where flood defence works have been completed.  Recognising the long-term risk of climate change on insurers and insurability, the Department of Finance also continues to monitor international developments, engage with the Central Bank of Ireland, the insurance industry, and actively participate in cross-departmental working groups on insurance. It is important to note in this regard that the European Commission, IMF, EIOPA and the OECD are separately examining climate risk impacts for insurance and the concept of insurance protection gaps, with recommendations for policymakers to emerge in time. In this context, it may also interest the Deputy that the during the South African Presidency of the G20 Ireland was an active member of the Sustainable Finance Working Group at which the issue of the climate protection gap was discussed and considered. Taking account of all of these various international and EU developments, I believe that it is important that measures here align with those across the EU, so the Irish market is not ‘out of step’ with others.  Supports for households affected by severe weather events are the responsibility of the Department of Social Protection who administer the Humanitarian Assistance Scheme while the Emergency Humanitarian Flooding Scheme, which provides supports for businesses affected by flooding, falls under the Department of Enterprise, Tourism, and Employment.  Finally, I and Minister of State Troy, along with our officials, will continue to engage on all aspects of insurance reform, including the impact of severe weather events. These matters remain a priority for this Government and efforts continue to be made to encourage a responsive approach from the insurance industry. I will continue to encourage industry to take a responsive approach to treat policyholders promptly and in line with the protections afforded under the Consumer Protection Code in the wake of such events.

As part of the budgetary process each year, my Department sets overall expenditure ceilings for each Ministerial Vote Group. These are laid out at Vote level in the Budget Day Expenditure Report published in October with further detail provided in the Revised Estimates for Public Services published in December.  Following the allocation of each Ministerial Expenditure Ceiling, it is a matter for each Minister to assign funding as appropriate at programme and subhead level for their Departments and the agencies under their remit, accounting for the demands for services in different areas and regions and having regard to demographics and other relevant factors. Within this process, both current and capital expenditure are allocated on a Departmental basis and not a geographic basis.  More broadly, the achievement of balanced regional development is a key priority of this Government and is at the heart of Project Ireland 2040, which includes the National Planning Framework (NPF), which sets out the overarching spatial strategy for the next twenty years, along with the National Development Plan.  Since Project Ireland 2040 was first launched in 2018, the Government has overseen the delivery of many impactful NDP projects across the country, including in Longford and Westmeath – for example:  • a new STEM building in the Athlone Campus of the Technological University of the Shannon;  • the completion of a 650 pupil post-primary school, Mean Scoil an Chlochaie in Kilbeggan; and  • a new library in Edgeworthstown;  • 170 social housing units in Lissywollen, Athlone; and  • A flood relief scheme protecting 550 homes in Athlone.  The NDP Review 2025 was published on Tuesday, 22 July 2025, in line with the Programme for Government commitment. The Plan committed €275.4 billion in public capital investment to 2035 – the largest and most significant capital injection in our economy in the history of the State.  Arising from this, €19.1 billion in Exchequer capital investment will be provided in 2026. The NDP significantly increases capital investment across the country, which will generate substantial employment demand in the construction sector. Delivering this enhanced pipeline of infrastructure will require additional workforce capacity, creating opportunities for skilled employment in every part of the country.  Departments have published sectoral investment plans setting out the capital projects to be prioritised from 2026 to 2030. These plans provide visibility of the delivery pipeline, giving construction firms the certainty they need to invest in hiring, training, and scaling their operations. This multi-year approach is designed to support industry planning and ensure that regional capacity can grow in line with demand.  In developing these sectoral plans, departments were required to demonstrate how their proposed investments align with the objectives of the National Planning Framework (NPF). This ensures that increased capital spending supports balanced regional development.  These sectoral plans are available on each Departmental website and will provide the Deputy with further detail on a sectoral basis.  Furthermore, progress in achieving balanced regional development and detailing the delivery of the NDP is monitored through regular updates of the Project Ireland 2040 capital investment tracker and MyProjectIreland interactive map viewer. The capital investment tracker provides a composite update on the progress of all major investments with an estimated cost of greater than €20 million. Accompanying the tracker, the myProjectIreland interactive map details projects across the country and provides details on specific projects by county, and contains smaller investments such as schools, healthcare facilities and social housing projects. Search facilities allow users to view projects in their regional area, by city, by county or by Eircode.  In addition, my Department also publishes the Project Ireland 2040 Annual Report and Regional Reports highlighting achievements and giving a detailed overview of the public investments that have been made throughout the country. These will provide the Deputy with further detail on delivery under the NDP to date. These and other Project Ireland 2040 related documents can be found at: www.gov.ie/2040 ",

Once the new scheme launches, projects that meet all eligibility criteria will be able to apply.  The EU Just Transition Fund is supporting lakeshore developments in the Midlands region. Through Fáilte Ireland’s Regenerative Tourism and Placemaking Scheme (2023–2026), funding has been awarded to several projects, including €1,067,722 provided under the EU Just Transition Fund to Roscommon County Council, in partnership with Waterways Ireland and Fáilte Ireland, for planning and design of a large-scale multifaceted project on the Hodson Bay waterfront area.  The funding received through the EU Just Transition Fund will help create a tourism and recreational destination accessible by land and water on the shores of Lough Ree and the development will help support and enhance tourism and economic developments for Hodson Bay and the wider midlands region in a balanced and sustainable way. The development also aligns with the objectives and ambition of the Shannon Tourism Masterplan 2020 to 2030 and Ireland Hidden Heartlands Regional development Strategy 2023 to 2027.  From 2018 to 2021, Fáilte Ireland partnered with the Department of Rural and Community Development and the Gaeltacht to co-fund and deliver the Outdoor Recreation Infrastructure Scheme (ORIS). During this period, Fáilte Ireland made a direct financial contribution to the scheme, supporting the development, enhancement and maintenance of outdoor recreational infrastructure across the country. This investment helped deliver projects such as trails, greenways, blueways, mountain access routes, and park and forest infrastructure, strengthening rural communities and enhancing Ireland’s outdoor tourism offering.  A key example of this partnership was the 2020 joint investment of €8.4 million, which funded 44 projects nationwide, with €4 million provided by Fáilte Ireland and €4.4 million by the Department.  Since 2022, while Fáilte Ireland is no longer a funding partner and does not financially contribute to ORIS, it continues to support the Department of Rural and Community Development and the Gaeltacht and local authorities in the delivery of the scheme. This support focuses on ensuring that ORIS-funded projects align with national and regional tourism strategies, complement destination development plans, and contribute to sustainable outdoor recreation and tourism outcomes. Recent ORIS projects include lakeside boardwalks, kayak trails, swimming facilities, and blueway improvements.  This collaborative approach aligns with broader national strategies such as Embracing Ireland’s Outdoors and is complemented by Fáilte Ireland’s ongoing work with partner agencies including Coillte, Waterways Ireland, and the National Parks & Wildlife Service.  I am also aware of the Community Water Development Fund which is provided by the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage and administered by LAWPRO. This fund supports community groups to enhance the quality of local streams, rivers, lakes, and coastal areas. The fund has been in place since 2017, with growing interest year on year. ",

        "answerText": " Minister for Enterprise, Tourism and Employment (Deputy Peter Burke)  Fáilte Ireland the National Tourism Development Authority has statutory powers under the Tourist Traffic Acts 1939–2016 in relation to the registration and grading of tourist accommodation. These registration and classification responsibilities include administrating accommodation legislation, monitoring of product quality, customer relations and in particular the management of appointed sub-contractors for the inspection and registration assessment of various accommodation categories.  The Acts require that any premises using prescribed terms such as “Hotel”, “Guest House” or “Caravan Park” must be registered with Fáilte Ireland and comply with the criteria set out in the relevant regulations.  Each accommodation category is governed by specific Registration and Renewal of Registration Regulations, which outline the conditions that must be met in order to use prescribed terms. Service providers are required to retain all relevant documentation for inspection by Fáilte Ireland. Where an applicant cannot demonstrate full compliance with the regulations, the application cannot proceed.  The Registration and Renewal of Registration Regulations for Short-Term Tourism Accommodation Rental 2018 provide for the registration of caravan and camping parks.  Caravan parks catering to tourists must comply with all statutory obligations, including fire safety requirements, as a condition of registration under the 2018 Regulations. Operators are required to demonstrate compliance with fire safety legislation, typically through certification issued by the relevant fire authority or other competent professionals.  Fáilte Ireland does not provide fire safety advice or certification. Responsibility for compliance with fire, gas and electrical safety legislation rests with the accommodation operator, as part of their legal obligations and duty of care to guests. ",

Since 2020, my department has invested over €6 billion in our schools throughout the country under the National Development Plan, involving the completion of over 1,300 school building projects. In addition, over 200 SEN Repurposing projects have been delivered maximising the use of existing accommodation while creating opportunities for inclusion and integration.  Government support for this investment, including by way of supplementary capital funding, has delivered real benefits for school communities. Supplementary capital funding of €210 million approved by Government has brought the total capital allocation for 2025 for my department to €1.6 billion.  In July the Government announced a capital allocation of €7.55 billion for the Department of Education and Youth for the period 2026-2030 under the National Development Plan.  Government departments are currently in the process of publishing their sectoral NDP Implementation Plans. The sectoral plan for the Education and Youth sector will be published shortly and the first tranche of projects to progress to construction will be published in January 2026.  This NDP Implementation Plan will optimise outputs from the NDP allocations, with a strong focus on maximising existing school capacity, progressing priority projects where local capacity across schools in the area is insufficient, and ensuring delivery that is affordable, offers value for money, and meets functional needs. A key focus of this investment is the delivery of integrated and inclusive provision for children with additional needs, through the development of new special schools, the expansion of special class provision, and the enhancement of existing facilities.  My department has invested over €41m in capital expenditure since 2020 in County Longford. This investment has supported the completion of 15 school building projects. Currently 2 projects are in construction.  My department has invested over €167m in capital expenditure since 2020 in County Westmeath.

        "answerText": " Minister of State at the Department of Education and Youth  I propose to take Questions Nos. 223 to 226, inclusive, together.  The School Transport Scheme is a significant operation managed by Bus Éireann on behalf of the Department of Education and Youth.  The scheme has expanded significantly over the past six years. In that time, the numbers of children and young people using the service have grown from under 120,000 pupils in 2018 to over 180,000 pupils in 2025, which equates to an increase of close to 50%. To date in the 2025/2026 school year, 2,642 mainstream tickets have issued for county Longford and 3,797 have issued for Westmeath. This represents a 5% and 9% increase in tickets issued for the respective counties compared to the 2024/2025 school year.  Additional funding is being allocated to school transport services in 2026. This is to provide for the additional demand for pupils with special educational needs on school transport services and increased bus contractor running costs. It will also provide for additional funding on the School Transport Scheme fleet.  Bus Éireann manages the procurement tender process and contract management arrangements to include services provided by contractors under the School Transport Scheme. The school transport fleet is made up of both contractors and Bus Éireann vehicles. Over 90% of services are provided by contractors operating on the School Transport Scheme. The school transport scheme is a demand led scheme based on the number of children who apply.  As part of the recommendations of the School Transport Review , fourteen School Transport pilots began in the 2024/2025 school year. I'm pleased to advise that these pilots are continuing in the current school year.  It was outlined at the time of the review’s publication that the proposed changes to the eligibility criteria will likely increase demand for the scheme. On this basis, it would be prudent to implement the proposed changes on a phased basis to ensure its rollout is as smooth as possible.  In line with the review’s recommendations, the School Transport Section of my Department engaged with Bus Éireann to identify where more pilots could be successfully delivered for the current school year.  Eleven further pilots have been selected for the current school year. The Department has given approval to Bus Éireann to review where additional capacity may be available for concessionary pupils who paid on time and would become eligible if the revised school transport scheme criteria was rolled out fully.  As part of these pilots, the distance criteria for pupils is reduced to 2km for primary and post primary and the need for a pupil to be attending their nearest school is removed. Some of these pilots are operational and the remainder are going through procurement.  In the coming months, e-Ticketing will be introduced on all dedicated school transport pilot routes, with families being advised on how pupils should use their the new school transport cards. E-ticketing should enhance students’ experiences on school transport and should allow for greater visibility on seat usage. With better data, this should inform future route planning and should maximise the efficiency and effectiveness of the system. These pilots will provide valuable insights on the impact increased demand will have on the scheme.  Provision of additional services as pilot projects will be subject to the availability of vehicles and drivers in each area. Implementation of the review recommendations will continue to be planned subject to resources being available to meet the increased demand. ",

        "answerText": " Minister for Education and Youth  In order to plan for school provision and analyse the relevant demographic data, my department divides the country into 314 school planning areas (SPA) and uses a geographical information system, using data from a range of sources, including CSO census data, child benefit and school enrolment data, to identify where the pressure for school places across the country will arise and where additional school accommodation is needed at primary and post-primary level.  Major new residential developments have the potential to alter the demand for school places at a local level. In that regard, as part of the demographic demand analysis, my department monitors planning and construction activity in the residential sector. This involves the analysis of data sources from local authorities and the CSO along with the engagement with local authorities and the construction sector. In this way, up-to-date information on significant new residential developments is obtained and factored into the demographic analysis exercise. This is necessary to ensure that schools infrastructure planning is keeping pace with demographic changes, at a local level, where there is a constantly evolving picture with planned new residential development.  Longford Town and Edgeworthstown are in the Longford Newtownforbes SPA. According to Child Benefit data in this SPA there are approximately 296 2 year olds, 317 3 year olds and 338 4 year olds that are likely to require junior infant places in the coming years. According to Child Benefit data in the Mullingar SPA, there are 433 2 year olds, 470 3 year olds and 438 4 year olds that are likely to require places in the coming years. The Athlone SPA has 375 2-year-olds, 365 3-year-olds and 448 4-year-olds that are likely to require junior infant places in the coming years. The Ballymahon SPA has 99 2 year olds, 98 3 year olds and 95 4 year olds that are likely to require places in the coming years  At primary level, enrolments for Longford and Ballymahon school planning areas peaked in 2018. Athlone SPA enrolments peaked in 2019 while Mullingar SPA enrolments are projected to have peaked in 2024 with enrolments projected to decrease thereafter.  My Department's main responsibility is to ensure that schools in an area can, between them, cater for all pupils seeking school places in the area. In relation to school admissions, it is the responsibility of the managerial authorities of all schools to implement an enrolment policy in accordance with the Education Act, 1998. The availability of places is a matter for each individual school in the context of admissions legislation and their individual policies. Enrolment data for previous school years is available on the Department website. Provisional enrolment data for the 2024/25 school year is available on the Department's website at www.gov.ie.  The Educational Welfare Services of the Child and Family Agency, Tusla, is the statutory agency that can assist parents who are experiencing difficulty in securing a school place for their child. The local service is delivered through the national network of Educational Welfare Officers. Contact details are available on Tusla’s website.  My Department will continue to liaise with Local Authorities in respect of their County Development Plans and any associated Local Area Plans with a view to identifying any potential long-term school accommodation requirements across school planning areas.

        "answerText": " Minister for Education and Youth  I can assure the Deputy that the provision of school places to meet the needs of children and young people at primary and post primary level, including children and young people with special educational needs is an absolute priority of mine.  Since 2020, my department has invested over €6 billion in our schools throughout the country under the National Development Plan, involving the completion of over 1,300 school building projects. In addition, repurposing and optimisation of existing accommodation capacity across the school estate has been a key enabler of timely, local provision of special class capacity in a way that supports best practice in inclusion and integration. Circa 80% of new special classes in 2025/26 are being facilitated in repurposed classroom accommodation.  As the Deputy may be aware, in order to plan for school provision and analyse the relevant demographic data, my department divides the country into 314 school planning areas and uses a geographical information system, using data from a range of sources, including CSO census data, child benefit and school enrolment data, to identify where the pressure for school places across the country will arise and where additional school accommodation is needed at primary and post-primary level.  While my department is aware of enrolment pressures and demand for additional school places in some areas, it is important to note that enrolment pressures can be driven by duplications of applications, applications from outside an area, and school of choice factors. Notwithstanding the above, in some areas, demographic pressures and other factors are driving a requirement for additional school places.  Primary school enrolments at national level have been in decline for a number of years and this downward demographic trend is also now apparent at first year post primary level. There are, however, continued pressures in some areas where there is high demand with continued population growth and housing development driving the need for additional school places.  My Department's main responsibility is to ensure that schools in an area can, between them, cater for all pupils seeking school places in the area. In relation to school admissions, it is the responsibility of the managerial authorities of all schools to implement an enrolment policy in accordance with the Education Act, 1998.  Data available to my Department highlights there are more first year places than sixth class children across the school planning areas of Athlone, Mullingar, Longford_Newtownforbes and Ballymahon. For the 2024/25 academic year 8.6% of first year places were unfilled in Mullingar, 15.3% were unfilled in Longford_Newtownforbes and 8.85% were unfilled in Ballymahon SPA.  There are currently a number of active projects at primary and post-primary level across the referred school planning areas that will increase capacity, including new school building projects for Marist College to cater for LTPE of 750 and four special education classrooms, this project is currently at Stage 1, and Gaelscoil an Longfoirt to provide 12 mainstream classrooms and two special education classrooms, this project is currently at Stage 2a. In addition, there is an extension project for St Finian's College to provide for LTPE 1,300 and six special education classrooms, this project is at Stage 4.  The Capital Programme details the school projects that are being progressed under Project Ireland 2040. The current status of large-scale projects being delivered under Project Ireland 2040, may be viewed on the Department's website at www.gov.ie and this information is updated regularly. In addition, a list of large-scale projects completed from 2010 to date may also be viewed on the website.  My Department will continue to keep the school place requirements in the Athlone, Mullingar, Longford_Newtownforbes and Ballymahon school planning areas, as with other areas across the country, under review.

Since 2020, my department has invested over €6 billion in our schools throughout the country under the National Development Plan, involving the completion of over 1,300 school building projects. In addition, over 200 SEN Repurposing projects have been delivered maximising the use of existing accommodation while creating opportunities for inclusion and integration.  Government support for this investment, including by way of supplementary capital funding, has delivered real benefits for school communities. Supplementary capital funding of €210 million approved by Government has brought the total capital allocation for 2025 for my department to €1.6 billion.  In July the Government announced a capital allocation of €7.55 billion for the Department of Education and Youth for the period 2026-2030 under the National Development Plan.  Government departments are currently in the process of publishing their sectoral NDP Implementation Plans. The sectoral plan for the Education and Youth sector will be published shortly and the first tranche of projects to progress to construction will be published in January 2026.  This NDP Implementation Plan will optimise outputs from the NDP allocations, with a strong focus on maximising existing school capacity, progressing priority projects where local capacity across schools in the area is insufficient, and ensuring delivery that is affordable, offers value for money, and meets functional needs. A key focus of this investment is the delivery of integrated and inclusive provision for children with additional needs, through the development of new special schools, the expansion of special class provision, and the enhancement of existing facilities.  My department has invested over €41m in capital expenditure since 2020 in County Longford. This investment has supported the completion of 15 school building projects. Currently 2 projects are in construction.  My department has invested over €167m in capital expenditure since 2020 in County Westmeath. This investment has supported the completion of 31 school building projects including 3 new school buildings. Currently 9 projects are in construction.  Project timeframes vary considerably in large capital programmes for many reasons, including factors beyond my department’s control, such as the time taken to secure a site or securing relevant statutory permissions including planning consent. The Department also must manage the rollout of projects within the parameters of its NDP funding. Delivery of school building projects are managed as effectively as possible, prioritising the most urgent projects where capacity is already fully utilised, and deploying modular accommodation where additional space is needed in the short term.  The current status of all projects is set out, under item number ten, at the following link (www.gov.ie). This is updated on a regular basis to reflect project progress through the various stages of capital appraisal, site acquisition, design, tender and construction. ",

        "answerText": " Minister for Education and Youth  I wish to advise the Deputy that requirement for school places is kept under on-going review in the context of available information on population, enrolments and residential development activity.  In order to plan for school provision and analyse the relevant demographic data, my department divides the country into 314 school planning areas and uses a geographical information system, using data from a range of sources, including CSO census data, child benefit and school enrolment data, to identify where the pressure for school places across the country will arise and where additional school accommodation is needed at primary and post-primary level.  Major new residential developments have the potential to alter the demand for school places at a local level. In that regard, as part of the demographic demand analysis, my department monitors planning and construction activity in the residential sector. This involves the analysis of data sources from local authorities and the CSO along with the engagement with local authorities and the construction sector. In this way, up-to-date information on significant new residential developments is obtained and factored into the demographic analysis exercise. This is necessary to ensure that schools infrastructure planning is keeping pace with demographic changes, at a local level, where there is a constantly evolving picture with planned new residential development.  Where demographic data indicates that additional provision is required, the delivery of such additional provision is dependent on the circumstances of each case and may, be provided through:  • Utilising existing unused capacity within a school or schools,  • Extending the capacity of a school or schools,  • Provision of a new school or schools.  If additional accommodation is required, the aim to try and facilitate this, as much as possible, by way of expansion of existing schools rather than establishing new schools. The expansion of existing schools is consistent with wider Government objectives under Project Ireland 2040 for an increased emphasis on compact growth. In respect of post primary schools, new post primary schools must have a student enrolment capacity of 600-1,000 students and must be co-educational. A lower threshold of 400 students may apply to gaelcholáistí, having regard to the alternative of establishing an Irish-medium unit (aonad) in an English-medium school.  New schools are only established in areas of demographic growth as the resources available for school infrastructure have to be prioritised to meet the needs of areas of significant population increase so as to ensure that every child has a school place.  There are no immediate plans to establish new primary or post primary schools in the midlands.  Details of large-scale projects being delivered under the school building programme may be viewed on my department's website at www.gov.ie and this information is updated regularly. In addition, a list of large-scale projects completed from 2010 to date may also be viewed on the website.  The department is awaiting revised National Development Plan housing targets from local authorities. This, along with the pace of delivery of additional residential development, updated enrolment data and demographic data will be kept under review and will inform the timing of school requirements in the midlands.

Met Technical Briefings were attended by local authority severe weather assessment teams, the principal response agencies, government departments, utilities and relevant agencies on Sunday 7th, Monday 8th, Tuesday 9th and Wednesday 10th December.  All local authorities stood up their severe weather teams, deployed their flood mitigation measures, cleared gullies/ culverts and had teams in place to respond as required. Safety messaging regarding high winds, floodwaters and staying away from exposed coastal areas were pushed out through all channels. The public were urged to be aware of local conditions, take necessary preparedness steps and to stay away from exposed coastal areas.  In the aftermath of Storm Bram, most local authorities experienced impacts with trees down, road closures and some localised coastal flooding. At the peak, ESB Networks reported circa 58,000 customers without power. It was reported that power was fully restored by 10th December.

The provision of a fire service in its functional area, including the establishment and maintenance of a fire brigade, the assessment of fire cover needs and the provision of fire station premises, is a statutory function of individual fire authorities under the Fire Services Act, 1981 & 2003. My Department supports fire authorities through setting general policy, providing a central training programme, issuing guidance on operational and other related matters and providing capital funding support for equipment and priority infrastructural projects.  Fire authorities have powers under the Fire Services Act, 1981 & 2003 to carry out inspections of some premises. Section 18(2) of the Act prescribes that the “person having control” over premises “take all reasonable measures to guard against the outbreak of fire on such premises, and to ensure as far as is reasonably practicable the safety of persons on the premises in the event of an outbreak of fire.\" Under section 13 of this act Fire Authorities may also advise a planning authority in relation to the functions of the planning authority which relates to permission for development.  My Department, through the National Directorate for Fire & Emergency Management (NDFEM) has issued guidance - “A Guide to Fire Safety in Existing Traveller Accommodation” - that includes information on fire safety in caravans, addressing means of escape, minimum spacing recommendations and pre-incident planning among other fire safety matters.  The NDFEM has developed also a “Fire Safety in Caravans” leaflet for caravan owners, copies of which are provided to fire services for distribution to members of the public.  The aforementioned leaflet and guidance along with other fire safety advice can be found at www.fireireland.ie. The most effective fire safety measure in any domestic setting is a working smoke alarm that is tested regularly. ",

        "answerText": " Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage  I propose to take Questions Nos. 280 and 281 together.  The provision of a fire service in its functional area, including the establishment and maintenance of a fire brigade, the assessment of fire cover needs and the provision of fire station premises, is a statutory function of individual fire authorities under the Fire Services Act, 1981 & 2003. My Department supports fire authorities through setting general policy, providing a central training programme, issuing guidance on operational and other related matters and providing capital funding support for equipment and priority infrastructural projects.  Fire authorities have powers under the Fire Services Act, 1981 & 2003 to carry out inspections of some premises. Section 18(2) of the Act prescribes that the “person having control” over premises “take all reasonable measures to guard against the outbreak of fire on such premises, and to ensure as far as is reasonably practicable the safety of persons on the premises in the event of an outbreak of fire.\" Under section 13 of this act Fire Authorities may also advise a planning authority in relation to the functions of the planning authority which relates to permission for development.  My Department, through the National Directorate for Fire & Emergency Management (NDFEM) has issued guidance - “A Guide to Fire Safety in Existing Traveller Accommodation” - that includes information on fire safety in caravans, addressing means of escape, minimum spacing recommendations and pre-incident planning among other fire safety matters.  The NDFEM has developed also a “Fire Safety in Caravans” leaflet for caravan owners, copies of which are provided to fire services for distribution to members of the public.  The aforementioned leaflet and guidance along with other fire safety advice can be found at www.fireireland.ie. The most effective fire safety measure in any domestic setting is a working smoke alarm that is tested regularly. ",

The Outdoor Recreation Infrastructure Scheme (ORIS) provides funding under a number of measures for the development of new outdoor recreational infrastructure and for the necessary repair, enhancement or promotion of existing outdoor recreation infrastructure in countryside areas across Ireland.  This includes outdoor recreation faculties at lakes. I was pleased to announce successful projects under all measures of the ORIS 2024/2025 scheme earlier this year and I hope to announce the next iteration of ORIS early next year. Since 2020 some €3.7 million has been approved for41 projects across Longford. This includes €1.18 million which was allocated to 10 Longford projects this year. In Westmeath, since 2020, over €2.8 million has been allocated to 43 projects including funding of €412,560 for 6 projects in 2025. This includes projects in the vicinity of both Lough Owel and Lough Ree in previous years.  Budget 2026 includes an allocation of €17m for ORIS, and I would encourage the Deputy to explore the potential for lake-based ORIS projects with the local authorities and local development companies in Meath and Longford for onward submission to my Department.

Under existing legislative arrangements, a household may apply for social housing support to one local authority only, which may be the authority for the area in which the household normally resides or with which it has a local connection. However, the local authority may agree, at its discretion, to assess the household for support without the need to meet the normally resides or local connection criteria.  A household meeting either the 'normally resides' or 'local connection' condition may specify up to three areas of choice for receipt of support in the areas of all local authorities in the county and city concerned and, if qualified, will be entered on the housing waiting list of each of those local authorities. Accordingly, under existing arrangements, the four Dublin local authorities have arrangements allowing social housing applicants apply for housing in up to two of the other Dublin authorities simultaneously. Similar arrangements apply in the two Cork and two Galway local authorities.  A household may, not less than 12 months after the date on which it is first entered on a housing authority’s housing list, notify the housing authority of application that it wishes to change one, or more than one, area of choice in the application area and a household may change one, or more than one, such area not less than 12 months after its most recent change of an area of choice. An applicant does not lose any time on the list by changing their area of choice.  Generally, is not possible for a household previously on one social housing waiting list to carry the time spent on that list when applying to another local authority. However, local authorities may provide for exceptional or emergency cases to qualified households, allowing immediate housing outside of normal waiting lists priorities, should circumstances require.

        "answerText": " Minister of State at the Department of Justice, Home Affairs and Migration  The naturalisation application referred to by the Deputy continues to be processed by my Department.  While I recognise that extended wait times can be frustrating for applicants, I want to assure those who have submitted an application for naturalisation that the Citizenship Division of my Department is doing everything possible to progress applications as quickly as possible.  It is important to note, however, that no two naturalisation applications are the same and some take longer than others to process. Given the importance of citizenship, robust and comprehensive checks must take place on each application. Unfortunately, some checks, including international checks, can take a considerable amount of time and are largely outside the control of the Immigration Service.  For that reason, while I expect that, going forward, most applicants will receive a decision within one year, this timeframe cannot be guaranteed in respect of applications made in any specific year.  Citizenship Division has taken a significant number of steps to improve the process for applicants. These include the introduction of an online digital application system, online payments, and eVetting. I am pleased to inform the Deputy that these measures are contributing to reduced processing times.  Applicants can now directly check the status of their immigration application on the Immigration Service’s Customer Service Portal. They can register for, or log in to their existing account, at: www.portal.irishimmigration.ie/en/ .  As an Oireachtas member, you can also request the status of individual immigration cases by e-mail, using the Oireachtas Mail facility at: IMoireachtasmail@justice.ie, which has been specifically established for this purpose. This service enables up to date information on such cases to be obtained without the need to seek information by way of the Parliamentary Question process. ",
