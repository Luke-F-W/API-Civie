        "answerText": " Minister of State at the Department of Public Expenditure, Infrastructure, Public Service Reform and Digitalisation  I propose to take Questions Nos. 379 and 380 together.  In 2018, the Office of Public Works (OPW) completed the largest study of flood risk ever undertaken by the State: the national Catchment-based Flood Risk Assessment and Management (CFRAM) Programme. The CFRAM Programme studied 80% of Ireland’s primary flood risk and identified solutions that can provide protection against over 95% of that risk. Some 150 new and additional flood relief schemes were identified through this Programme.  Nationally, 56 schemes have been completed to date which are providing protection to some 13,580 properties and an economic benefit to the State in damages and losses avoided estimated to be in the region of €2 billion. Consequently, work to protect 80% of all at-risk properties nationally is completed or underway. The Springfield Flood Relief Scheme in County Clare has recently reached completion, and 21 properties are now benefitting from the project.  Since 2018, a phased approach to scheme delivery, in partnership with Local Authorities, has allowed the OPW to treble the number of schemes at design, planning, or construction at this time to some 100 schemes. The Government has committed €1.3 billion to the delivery of these flood relief schemes over the lifetime of the National Development Plan.  There are currently 10 flood relief schemes at Implementation / Construction (Stage IV): Athlone; Crossmolina; Glashaboy; King’s Island; Morell River; Morrison’s Island; the Poddle River; the River Wad; Templemore; and Whitechurch Flood Relief Schemes.  The implementation of flood relief projects is a very complex process with significant challenges. Major flood relief schemes are large multiannual projects and involve complex engineering and construction operations that can impact on people's living, built and natural environment. They entail extensive landowner and stakeholder engagement and detailed environmental assessments and mitigation measures. Detailed technical analysis is required to establish the most appropriate solution, technically and environmentally, from a range of possible design options. The delivery process is lengthy and follows a number of stages, from feasibility through design, planning, detailed design and construction.  It is also worth noting that local flooding issues are a matter, in the first instance, for each Local Authority to investigate and address, and each Local Authority may carry out flood mitigation works using its own resources.  Local Authorities may also apply to the OPW for funding of flood mitigation works under the Minor Flood Mitigation Works and Coastal Protection Scheme. The purpose of this scheme is to provide funding to Local Authorities to undertake minor flood mitigation works or studies to address localised flooding and coastal protection problems within their administrative areas. Following a recent announcement, an increase in funding supports is to be made available to Local Authorities under the Minor Works Scheme, including an increase in the upper Minor Works threshold from €750,000 to €2,000,000, which will facilitate an increase in the scale of works that may be funded and with the aim of improving the range of supports available under the scheme. The OPW will issue further details of the revisions to the Scheme to Local Authorities over the coming weeks.  A tabulated list of active Major Schemes that are currently at Stage IV: Implementation / Construction (Table 1) and their respective provisional dates for reaching substantial completion is provided below.

When will the Minister establish the local democracy task force promised in the programme for Government 2025 to re-establish local government? \n Deputy John Cummins  I propose to take Question Nos. 15 and 111 together.  I thank the Deputy for his interest in this matter. Having served in local government for 11 years, I value the role of our councillors and of local democracy. This specific commitment is contained in the programme for Government. I have worked extensively on this since taking up this role a number of weeks ago. Both the Minister, Deputy Browne, and I have engaged with the Association of Irish Local Government, AILG, and the Local Authorities Members Association, LAMA, the representative bodies for local councillors, in this regard.  As the Deputy rightly pointed out, the Local Government Reform Act 2014 dissolved 80 town councils, which represented just 14% of the population. The previous town council system also led to a duplication of administrative and electoral terms. Instead, the Act saw the introduction of 95 municipal districts, representing 100% of the population, in 25 of the 31 local authority areas at sub-county level, while area committees operate in Cork, Dublin and Galway, and in metropolitan areas within the Limerick and Waterford areas.  We have not costed the re-establishment of town councils. We are finalising the terms of reference for the task force at present and hope to be able to bring them to Government shortly. \n Deputy Seamus Healy  I thank the Minister. The town and borough councils were abolished in 2014. They were replaced by committees with no powers, functions or funding. This abolition of town and borough councils has seriously damaged towns throughout the country, including in Clonmel where we had a form of local government going back to the 1400s. This is a very serious issue. I had hoped the Minister of State could give a timeline for the establishment of the local democracy task force, initially, and for the completion of that work and re-establishment of the councils. \n An Cathaoirleach Gníomhach (Deputy David Maxwell)  We are over time. \n Deputy John Cummins  Briefly, I am working to finalise the terms of reference of the local democracy task force to bring them to Government as quickly as possible. I want to see this task force established as quickly as possible. We are working on the terms of reference and I hope to see that body of work as soon as possible to be able to present options to Government for consideration. ",

        "answerText": " Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage  I propose to take Questions Nos. 30, 64 and 74 together.  Housing for All includes a commitment to review income eligibility for social housing. From this review, completed in November 2021, it was recommended moving five local authorities from Band 3 to Band 2, ensuring the income eligibility thresholds better reflect housing costs in those counties. Government also agreed to increase the baseline income thresholds by €5,000 for all local authorities with effect from 1 January 2023. The thresholds thus increased to €40,000, €35,000 and €30,000 for bands 1, 2 and 3 respectively.  The review further recommended the commissioning of research to develop options for a revised or new social housing income eligibility model. My Department received this detailed research, commissioned by the Housing Agency. The scope of the research included examining the existing income limits in the context of current market and population conditions and the suitability or otherwise of the current framework having regard to the significantly changed landscape since the standardised income limits were introduced.  My Department is now undertaking a detailed examination of the report, in order to develop a new social housing income eligibility model in line with the Housing for All Action Plan update. This detailed examination will include consultation with stakeholders and will look at, inter alia, how the social housing income limits system interacts with other housing supports and ensure that they continue to target households correctly.

The Office will develop a co-ordinated programme of public infrastructure investment to address infrastructure barriers impacting housing delivery. It is envisaged that the Office will manage a multi-annual housing infrastructure budget under the new Towns and Cities Infrastructure Investment Fund to support investment in infrastructure and facilities needed to enable housing delivery.

The regulations provide for a number of specified classes of houses to be excluded from sale, including those provided to local authorities under Part V of the Planning and Development Act 2000. The Part V provisions seek to promote social integration and secure mixed tenure, sustainable communities. Accordingly, Part V properties are excluded from the scheme to ensure the original policy goals of the legislation are not eroded over time and the properties remain available for people in need of social housing support.  My Department monitors schemes such as this on an ongoing basis to ensure that they remain effective and sustainable, however, there are no plans to amend this aspect of the scheme at this time. ",

        "answerText": " Deputy Seamus Healy  This question relates to the IDA-owned site at Ballingarrane in Clonmel. Will the Minister outline the number of IDA-sponsored client visits to that site at Clonmel in 2023 and 2024? What steps will the IDA take to find an enterprise for the site? \n Deputy Peter Burke  I thank the Deputy for his question. The IDA has a landholding of 20 ha at Ballingarrane science and technology park in Clonmel, County Tipperary, and, in partnership with Tipperary County Council, has lodged a planning application for a 10,000 sq.m advanced building solution on a site area of approximately 3.4 ha. This application is currently proceeding through the planning process. IDA Ireland continues to work to market the site and proposed planning permission at Ballingarrane to potential new and existing investors through the agency’s network of overseas and regional offices. In this regard, the IDA, together with Tipperary County Council, has prepared and shared marketing materials, including a brochure and a promotional video, via the IDA Ireland website.  On site visits, data is only available on a county basis. I am advised that there were eight visits to County Tipperary in 2023, two in 2024 and one, to date, this year. I should indicate, however, that site visits are only one measure of a company’s interest in a particular location and may not necessarily be a true measure of the overall level of FDI activity in a region or county. For example, 70% of FDI won for Ireland by the IDA in 2024 came from its existing client base rather than new companies. Potential clients visiting Ireland may visit more than one county and may return to a location more than once. Also, the figures that represent individual visits are not necessarily indicative of the number of companies that have been visited.  I also remind the Deputy that the final decision on where to locate an investment is always made by the client company and not by the IDA. It can take many years to convert an initial site visit into a project approval. \n Deputy Seamus Healy  Ballingarrane estate was purchased in 2001 by South Tipperary County Council, in what was a far-seeing decision, to provide a vital piece of infrastructure for industrial development, not just for Clonmel and south Tipperary, but also for the surrounding areas of west Waterford, east Limerick and west Kilkenny. It comprises 270 acres, 50 acres of which are owned by the IDA, as the Minister said. There is already a successful development on the site. Questum is an enterprise acceleration unit operated by the Technological University of the Shannon. That has been very successful in employing approximately 200 people in 15 different enterprises. It is vital that a significant anchor industry be secured for the site. I am aware of the plans and the planning application for an advanced factory solution. I also understand, as the Minister said, that the IDA is marketing the site by way of a promotional video, but 25 years is far too long to wait for an anchor tenant for a site that is vital for essential future industrial development in Clonmel and its surrounding areas. \n Deputy Peter Burke  I will point out that we have seen a significant increase in IDA activity and employment in the mid-west region - approximately 16% over the past five years. The Deputy will know of very important client companies in his region, including Boston Scientific and Waystone, where there has been a new investment of 100 jobs. Working very closely with my colleague, Michael Murphy, we are doing a huge amount of work on delivering infrastructure to the region that will support the growth of employment. That is why we see 5,589 people, which means 5,589 families, who go to work every single day in IDA client companies in County Tipperary. There are approximately 27,968 such jobs in the mid-west region. That is why the IDA strategy out to 2029 focuses on delivering on the investment that is currently there. As I said in my contribution, the amount that comes from existing clients, notwithstanding new clients coming into the economy is very significant. We will be working very hard on that. As Minister for enterprise, I will ensure that high-quality jobs are coming right across our region. Specifically, the new strategy calls for 55% of all new jobs to go to regional Ireland. \n Deputy Seamus Healy  I remind the Minister that south Tipperary is not in the mid-west region. The IDA must ramp up its marketing of the Ballingarrane site. I am not satisfied that it has done enough. It must do more. I ask the Minister to intervene with the IDA to ramp up that marketing. There are some very successful industries in the area, including flagship industries, such as Abbott Vascular and Boston Scientific in Clonmel town and MSD in nearby Ballydine. The success of these industries should assist the IDA in securing an industry for the Ballingarrane site. As I said, this site is vitally important for the future industrial and social development of Clonmel and all the surrounding areas, including west Waterford, east Limerick and east Kilkenny. The sooner an anchor tenant is got for that site, the better. \n Deputy Peter Burke  To be absolutely clear, the figures I gave for the IDA's marketing in the mid-west region are for Limerick, Clare and Tipperary, which are categorised together. The Deputy will see the results I pointed out. There are 27,000 jobs in that sector. There is also a very significant investment in the capital fund, where we have our advanced factory units, and where the IDA part the Deputy referenced is seeing the opportunity of that investment as it goes through the planning process.  We have to appreciate that it is very competitive to bring multinational investment into our country. Those who so often criticise the IDA for not doing enough also go against the key policies that bring that foreign direct investment into our country and allow it to sustain and grow. In one respect, it is fine to say the IDA is not doing enough to market the site, but it is also important to acknowledge that the consistent policies of the current and previous Governments have made us a very agile country, where we have 300,000 jobs in our economy in the FDI sector. Critically, that eco-cycle is joined with our SMEs and family businesses, where we have seen exceptional growth over the past number of years, in a context where Enterprise Ireland has targeted €50 billion of exports to 2029.

        "answerText": " Minister for Education  Since 2020, my department has invested over €5.8 billion in our schools throughout the country, involving the completion of over 1,300 school building projects and with construction currently underway at approximately 300 other projects, which includes new school buildings, some of which are being delivered in phases. These 300 projects currently at construction involve a total State investment of over €1.5 billion.  In April 2024 the department announced that close to 90 projects, including 28 new school buildings, would be authorised to proceed from tender stage to construction over the course of 2024 and early 2025. In total, around €800 million is being invested in these projects under the department’s Large Scale Capital Programme and Additional Accommodation Scheme for essential classroom accommodation.  Between projects currently under construction and projects moving to construction in this latest phase, investments by the Department of Education are adding over 600,000 square metres of new and modernised capacity to our school estate.  This is a record level of investment in school buildings. It will expand the number of school places, significantly increase provision for special education and upgrade and modernise our school infrastructure. The impact of this will be felt in communities right around the country.  The key drivers of capital investment in the schools sector include:  • demographic growth, particularly at post primary level  • increased demand for special educational needs provision  • alignment of school place provision with new housing development  • climate action objectives including deep energy retrofit.  Since 2021, the total capital invested in Co. Tipperary schools is over €127m. Please see table below.

There are approximately 3,500 claims in payment at present. The government has provided €46.99 million for the scheme in 2025.  In line with many other means-tested social welfare schemes, the first €20,000 of capital is not assessed in the means test for Farm Assist. Based on the Department's records of Farm Assist customers who have means to capital, it is estimated that increasing the capital disregard to €34,000 would cost up to €700,000 per annum. In addition, there may be an unknown number of people who do not qualify currently for a payment but who would qualify in the event of an increase in the amount of capital that is disregarded.  Any changes to the Farm Assist scheme would have to be considered in a budgetary context, within the scope of the overall resources available for welfare improvements.

        "answerText": " Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage  I propose to take Questions Nos. 895 and 982 together.  Housing for All includes a commitment to review income eligibility for social housing. From this review, completed in November 2021, it was recommended moving five local authorities from Band 3 to Band 2, ensuring the income eligibility thresholds better reflect housing costs in those counties. Government also agreed to increase the baseline income thresholds by €5,000 for all local authorities with effect from 1 January 2023. The thresholds thus increased to €40,000, €35,000 and €30,000 for bands 1, 2 and 3 respectively.  The review further recommended the commissioning of research to develop options for a revised or new social housing income eligibility model. My Department received this detailed research, commissioned by the Housing Agency. The scope of the research included examining the existing income limits in the context of current market and population conditions and the suitability or otherwise of the current framework having regard to the significantly changed landscape since the standardised income limits were introduced.  My Department is now undertaking a detailed examination of the report, in order to develop a new social housing income eligibility model in line with the Housing for All Action Plan update. This detailed examination will include consultation with stakeholders and will look at, inter alia, how the social housing income limits system interacts with other housing supports and ensure that they continue to target households correctly.  Cost Rental is a form of rental tenure designed to assist a cohort of renters who may face significant affordability challenges meeting high rents in the private sector, but who are not eligible for social housing support. The core principle of Cost Rental is that the rents cover the development, management, and maintenance costs of the homes, so that the long-term future of the homes is financially secure, but that rents are not subject to the pressures of the open market. Unlike market-driven rents, Cost Rental prices only increase in line with consumer inflation, providing stability while meeting ongoing expenses. Additionally, Cost Rental homes offer long-term, secure tenancies regulated by the Affordable Housing Act 2021.  My Department is currently working on revising the income eligibility for cost rental, in recognition of changing economic metrics since August 2023 and the commitment in the Programme for Government to keep eligibility under review. At the same time, the intention is that new eligibility conditions will also be provided specifically for those tenants who may apply to share a cost rental home (and the rent) under a multiple occupancy scenario, as per the amendments made to the Affordable Housing Act 2021 late last year.

        "answerText": " Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage  Through a number of social housing funding programmes, local authorities are supported by my Department to purchase and renovate vacant/derelict properties to be upgraded as new, value-for-money social homes.  The Buy & Renew Scheme allows local authorities to acquire and refurbish such properties and since it was introduced in 2016, in excess of 950 properties have been delivered under this arrangement, as new social homes.  The Social Housing Investment Programme/SHIP which is the main capital programme that supports local authorities in the development of new social housing, also provides them with full funding to acquire and renew/re-model existing vacant/derelict properties in need of more substantial capital investment, with a view to the delivery of new social homes. This acquisition can be either by agreement or by CPO and it creates opportunities for local authorities to respond to more significant dereliction in town centres.  Furthermore through the Capital Assistance Scheme/CAS, AHBs are supported to undertake similar work on vacant/derelict properties to deliver new social homes.  I am pleased to see an increasing number of local authorities use these opportunities and there is no cap or restriction on the extent to which this approach may be used by local authorities or AHBs, other than the individual projects being reasonable value for money. My Department covers 100% of the development costs for new social homes whether they are the renewal of existing buildings including former commercial premises, or new build projects.  Tipperary County Council is one of many local authorities that utilises this approach to tackle vacancy/dereliction and deliver new social homes and further information on individual projects within their social housing delivery pipelines will be available directly from the local authorities.  As well as the permanent acquisition of vacant properties by local authorities and AHBs, my Department also provides the Repair and Leasing scheme/RLS which allows a local authority or AHB to provide a loan of up to €80,000 per unit to a property owner to bring a vacant property up to residential tenancy standards. Where a vacant property is renovated to provide more than one home, a loan of €80,000 is available per unit provided. The refurbished units are then leased to the local authority or an AHB for between 5 and 25 years. The interest free loan is recouped by way of an offset from the lease payment over an agreed term.  My Department's broader efforts to tackle vacancy and make efficient use of existing housing stock can be seen in the Vacant Homes Action Plan Progress Report launched in April 2024, which highlights the key measures that have been undertaken across all relevant Government departments to support this work - it is available on my Department's website at the following link: gov - Vacant Homes Action Plan 2023-2026 (www.gov.ie).  A key initiative of the Vacant Homes Action Plan was the Vacant Property Refurbishment Grant to refurbish vacant and derelict properties. Uptake of the grant has increased exponentially across 2024 and by the end of December, over 11,300 applications had been received, with over 7,700 approved and 1,449 grants paid out. ",

IDA Ireland in partnership with Tipperary County Council have lodged planning for a proposed 10,000 sq.m. Advanced Building Solution on a site area of approx. 3.4 hectares (approx. 8.4 acres) at Ballingarrane Science and Technology Park, Clonmmel, Co. Tipperary. This application is currently going through the planning process. In the meantime, IDA Ireland continues to market the site and proposed planning permission at Ballingarrane to potential new and existing investors through their network of overseas and regional offices. In this regard IDA, together with Tipperary County Council, have prepared and shared marketing materials such as a brochure and promotional video via the IDA Ireland website.  In relation to specific site visits, data on site visits is available on a county basis and as requested by the Deputy, the number of IDA facilitated visits to County Tipperary throughout 2023 and 2024 is set out in tabular form below:     Site Visits    2023    2024      Tipperary    8    2       It should be noted, however, that IDA site visits are only one measure of a company’s interest in a particular location and may not necessarily be a true measure of the overall level of foreign direct investment (FDI) activity in a region or county. For example, 70% of FDI won by IDA Ireland in 2024 came from its existing client base, rather than new companies. Also, potential clients visiting Ireland may visit more than one county and may return to a location more than once. The figures given, therefore, represent individual visits and are not indicative of the number of companies that have visited.  It should also be noted that the final decision on where to locate an investment is always decided by the client, and not by IDA Ireland, and it can take many years to convert from initial site visit to final project proposal. Regular engagement and collaboration with stakeholders are important in positioning any regional location to attract FDI and, in this respect, IDA Ireland continues to engage with stakeholders as well as working with existing clients in all regional locations to generate additional employment.

To date, there have been three rounds of funding provided under the URDF, with approximately €1.9 billion allocated so far. While Call 1 and 2 were for specific regeneration projects, the latest round of funding (Call 3) is supporting a programme of acquisitions in each local authority to address long term vacancy and dereliction. Under Call 1 and Call 2, there were 132 proposals, comprising of more than 400 individual projects, approved for funding. URDF supported projects are now active in every local authority area in the country.  With regard to Tipperary, €36,666,190 in URDF support has been provided to Tipperary County Council for various projects under the first 3 rounds of funding. Over €15 million of this was towards the Regeneration of Kickham Barracks and the development of a Regional Sports Hub in Clonmel.  In line with the agreed Programme for Government, it is my intention to continue and expand URDF-type investment in projects as part of the new Towns and Cities Infrastructure Investment Fund, which will also allow for investment in infrastructure, the acquisition of land, assembly of sites and the de-risking of sites in existing towns and cities to maximise their potential growth.

Regulations were made in 1971, 1973 and 1975, prescribing 16 conditions covered by the Scheme. These are: acute leukaemia; mental handicap; cerebral palsy; mental illness (in a person under 16); cystic fibrosis; multiple sclerosis; diabetes insipidus; muscular dystrophies; diabetes mellitus; parkinsonism; epilepsy; phenylketonuria; haemophilia; spina bifida; hydrocephalus; and conditions arising from the use of Thalidomide.  Under the LTI Scheme, patients receive drugs, medicines, and medical and surgical appliances directly related to the treatment of their illness, free of charge. While there are currently no plans to extend the list of conditions, it is important to remember that the LTI Scheme exists within a wider eligibility framework.  There has been a significant focus on improving access to and the affordability of healthcare services over the last few years. This includes reductions in the Drugs Payment Scheme threshold, expansion of access to free GP care, and the abolition of all public in-patient hospital charges for children and adults. These measures continue to create a health and social care service that offers affordable access to quality healthcare.  People who cannot, without undue hardship, arrange for the provision of medical services for themselves and their dependants may be eligible for a medical card under the General Medical Services (GMS) Scheme. In accordance with the provisions of the Health Act 1970 (as amended), eligibility for a medical card is determined by the HSE.  In certain circumstances the HSE may exercise discretion and grant a medical card, even though an applicant exceeds the income guidelines, where he or she faces difficult financial circumstances, such as extra costs arising from illness. In circumstances where an applicant is still over the income limit for a medical card, they are then assessed for a GP visit card, which entitles the applicant to GP visits without charge.  Under the Drugs Payment Scheme (DPS), no individual or family pays more than €80 a month towards the cost of approved prescribed medicines. The DPS is not means tested and is available to anyone ordinarily resident in Ireland. The DPS significantly reduces the cost burden for families and individuals with ongoing expenditure on medicines.  Individuals may also be entitled to claim tax relief on the cost of their medical expenses, including medicines prescribed by a doctor, dentist, or consultant. Relief is at the standard tax rate of 20%. ",

        "showAs": " 86. Deputy Seamus Healy asked the Minister for Social Protection the detail of how and when he intends to implement the Programme for Government commitment to abolish the income limit for the carer’s allowance; and if he will make a statement on the matter. [8927/25] ",
        "answerText": " Deputy Seamus Healy  I congratulate the Minister on his appointment and wish him well in the Department.  Both Government parties in their election manifestos committed to the abolition of the means test for the carer’s allowance. The public believed when those parties formed a Government that the means test would be abolished, if not immediately then certainly in the 2026 budget in October. There seems to be no clarity about that now and I ask for clarity on that today. \n Deputy Dara Calleary  I thank the Deputy and congratulate him and welcome him back to the House.  Carer’s allowance is an important income support for people who have caring responsibilities. That is clear from the fact that there are nearly 99,000 people in receipt of the payment and expenditure on the scheme in 2025 is estimated to be over €1.24 billion.  In common with other welfare payments to people aged under 66 years the purpose of the payment is to provide an income support to people whose earning capacity is substantially reduced. In the case of other payments that may be because the person is ill or disabled or becomes unemployed. In the case of carer's allowance, it is to acknowledge the person cannot work full-time due to their caring duties and responsibilities.  A number of significant improvements have been made to the income thresholds in the means test in recent years. Those thresholds, as I said to Deputy O’Reilly, have increased by 88% since 2022 and now amount to €625 for a single person and €1,250 for a couple. That means that a couple earning over €95,000 per annum would still qualify for a partial payment.  Recognising the important work of family carers, the programme for Government commits to continue to increase the income disregards for carer's allowance in each budget with a view to phasing out the means test completely during the lifetime of this Government. The work that has been done with an increase of over 88% since 2022 gives a good indication of where we intend to go on that.  The reason we must phase that commitment is because we must manage the available resources to balance the objective of supporting carers with other priorities, including supporting other groups who are supported by the Department. The means test has significant cost potential but I have to balance that with other priorities.  Nevertheless, I assure the Deputy and the House that carers are a priority. I very much value and appreciate the work they do, and this is a priority for the Government and for me, as Minister. \n Deputy Seamus Healy  I thank the Minister for the reply, but we still have no clarity on when this means test will be abolished. As I said, the public believed the means test was going to be abolished either immediately on the formation of the Government or, at the very least, in budget 2026 in October of this year. From what the Minister said, there is absolutely no clarity on that. I acknowledge there have been increases in the limits over the years, which are welcome, but the commitment is to abolish the means test and that should and must be done, sooner rather than later, on the basis of the commitments given both in the election manifestos and in the programme for Government. Carers save the State €20 billion a year and give 19 million hours for free every week. They do exceptionally good work and save the State billions of euro. It is incumbent on the Government to abolish the test immediately. \n Deputy Dara Calleary  I absolutely acknowledge the work of carers, which we see at first hand, and that is why it is also important we acknowledge the extent of the improvements the previous Government brought in for carers over recent years. We introduced the long-term carer's contribution scheme in January 2024, which allows a person who has been a full-time carer for an incapacitated dependant for 20 years or more to use long-term carer's contributions to cover gaps in their contribution records, allowing them to qualify for a contributory State pension. As stated previously, we have also increased the income disregard and, as part of budget 2025, the carer's support was increased to €2,000, the highest rate it has ever been. Moreover, with the support of carers and following engagement with them and their representative organisations, the capital disregard was increased from June 2022, which allows carers to have capital of up to €100,000.  I intend to engage with carers' groups and organisations regarding further supports and to engage with the Oireachtas committee on social protection in this space. I assure the Deputy this is a priority for me. \n Deputy Seamus Healy  In 2024, the Parliamentary Budget Office estimated the cost of abolishing the means test as €375.3 million, which is very similar to the figure Family Carers Ireland gave, of about €389 million. That is very small money in the scheme of things. The work of family carers ensures that people with disabilities can remain at home and do not have to take up expensive beds in hospitals or nursing homes. It is self-financing and there would be huge savings to the State from abolishing the means test. Doing so is necessary and urgent and will accrue great savings to the State. \n Deputy Dara Calleary  Absolutely. Carers' work is extraordinary and there is also the benefit of having somebody remain at home. Leaving aside the financial sides of things, having somebody remain at home is much better for their long-term recovery and long-term living. In the context of budgetary discussions, we will review all the figures. I will engage with the carers' organisations but also with the committee on social protection, when it is established, and we will look at all those issues. I absolutely assure the Deputy, and all Deputies, that carers are a priority for me, and I will have very good and constructive engagement with them. It is a priority within the programme for Government that I intend to be focused on delivering. ",

[6064/25] ",
        "answerText": " Tánaiste and Minister for Defence  The military authorities have advised me that the strength of the Naval Service, as at 31 December 2024, the latest date for which this figure is available, stood at 719 personnel of an agreed establishment strength of 1,094.  There are approximately 150 persons currently in full time training and therefore not available for assignment to Sea Going duties without significant disruption to their training. The majority of trained personnel in the Naval Service are available for seagoing duties. Some do not deploy to sea due to their rank and responsibilities ashore.  Staffing challenges in the Defence Forces, and more specifically in the Naval Service, have been previously acknowledged. To address these a number of initiatives are currently in train. These include a doubling of the Patrol Duty allowance after ten days at sea, the extension of the Naval Service tax credit for a further five years, the outsourcing of elements of the recruitment process for the Naval Service and the engagement of a marine specialists’ recruitment body to target skilled individuals required by the Naval Service while significant upgrades in accommodation are continuing.  These initiatives are in addition to a range of other measures that we have implemented for the Defence Forces as a whole including the extension of private medical care to all personnel, an increase in the maximum age of retirement to 62 and the age of recruitment for General Service/Cadets to 39, and to 50 for Direct Entry specialists and the application of the Working Time Directive across the Defence Forces last month.  There has been significant progress on pay for the Defence Forces. Following the most recent pay increases under the Public Service Pay Agreement 2024-2026 , as of 1st October 2024 the pay of recruits on completion of training starts at €40,298 for a Private 3 star, while a school leaver Cadet on commissioning is paid €44,216 and the pay rate for a graduate entrant on commissioning begins at €49,552. A further 2% pay increase is due on 1 March 2025.  Budget 2025 has provided a total allocation of €1.35 billion for the Defence Sector for 2025 which includes a provision for the recruitment and training of at least a net additional 400 Defence Forces personnel in 2025.  Whilst challenges undoubtedly remain, significant progress has been made across a range of fronts and the allocation of record levels of expenditure to the Defence sector is illustrative of my commitment in this regard.

        "answerText": " Minister of State at the Department of Health  The Deputy will be familiar with the background to the closure of both the Mobility Allowance and the Motorised Transport Grant Schemes in 2013.  The Deputy may be aware that my colleague, the Minister for Health and I, brought a Memorandum to Government on proposals for a new Transport Support Payment Scheme.  Following Cabinet consideration, the Memorandum was withdrawn at that time.  I intend to revert to Government in due course with revised proposals to reflect the discussions at that Cabinet meeting and further discussions between myself and Minister Harris, on the best way to progress the Transport Support Payment Scheme.  It is important to note that the Disabled Drivers and Disabled Passengers scheme, operated by the Revenue Commissioners, remains in place.  This scheme provides VRT and VAT relief, an exemption from road tax and a fuel grant to drivers and passengers with a disability, who qualify under the relevant criteria set out in governing regulations made by the Minister for Finance. Specifically adapted vehicles driven by persons with a disability are also exempt from payment of tolls on national roads and toll bridges. Transport Infrastructure Ireland has responsibility for this particular scheme.  The Deputy may wish to note that in July last, my colleague the Minister for Rural and Community Development, announced CLÁR funding of €890,632 to 20 voluntary community organisations. This funding will support the purchase and/or fit out of vehicles to provide transport for people in rural areas with mobility issues. It will support voluntary organisations that provide:-  - transport for people with significant mobility issues, including those requiring specialised  wheelchair accessible vehicles, to day-care or other medical, therapeutic or respite services; or  - transport to/from designated cancer treatment hospitals/centres under the National Cancer Care Programme.  The Deputy might be interested to know that the Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection, Regina Doherty T.D., has commissioned research into the cost of disability.  The cost of disability can be defined as the amount it costs a person with a disability to achieve the same standard of living as those persons without a disability.  This includes extra living costs such as heating; disability aids and equipment; medical and drug costs; care costs and transport costs.  Following a procurement process, Indecon International Consultants have been commissioned by that Department to carry out this research.  It is hoped that the research, when complete, will inform policy direction in relation to the provision of adequate supports to meet the needs of people with disabilities, from a whole-of-Government perspective.  There are improvements in access to a range of transport supports available to persons with disabilities in the State and on-going work is being carried out by Government Departments, agencies and transport providers to further improve access to public transport services.  Under the National Disability Inclusion Strategy, the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport has responsibility for the continued development of accessibility and availability of public transport for people with a disability.
