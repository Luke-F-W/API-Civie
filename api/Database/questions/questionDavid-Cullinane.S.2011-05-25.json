        "answerText": " Minister for Education and Youth  As the Deputy may be aware, the purpose of the Emergency Works Scheme (EWS) is to provide funding specifically for unforeseen emergencies, or to provide funding to facilitate inclusion and access for pupils with special needs. It does so by ensuring the availability of funding for urgent works to those schools that are in need of resources as a result of an emergency situation.  An emergency is deemed to be a situation which poses an immediate risk to health, life, property or the environment, which is sudden, unforeseen and requires immediate action, and in the case of a school, if not corrected would prevent the school or part thereof from opening.  The EWS operates on the basis of a minimal scope works to address the emergency situation. The EWS is intended to remedy an emergency situation and usually provides only an interim measure until a permanent solution can be delivered under the Summer Works Scheme (SWS) which deals with upgrade works to the school.

The National Council for Special Education (NCSE) is the statutory body responsible for the provision of special education and allocating supports for students with special educational needs.  Almost 1,900 classes have been sanctioned by the NCSE in the last five years, sixteen new special schools have been established and many more expanded. For the 2025/26 school year alone over 400 new special classes have been sanctioned bringing the total number of special classes nationwide to over 3,700. Five new special schools were established and capacity is being expanded in a number of other special schools.  The vast majority of students with special educational needs are supported to attend mainstream classes with their peers. Where students with more complex needs require additional supports, special classes and special school places are provided. These classes are resourced in line with the Special Education Review Committee's recommendations. This ensures that these classes continue to meet the needs of students who are enrolled, and the class is as inclusive as possible in that as many students as possible are accommodated.  Generally, these classes are resourced at a 6:1 student/teacher ratio and two special needs assistants are allocated to each class. For the school years 2022/23, 2023/24 and 2024/25 in County Waterford there were 3 special schools with 271, 276 and 274 pupils enrolled respectively.  The following table shows the number of special classes per county from the 2020/21 to 2025/2026 school years and the percentage increase in the number of special classes. Enrolment data for schools is available on the government website via the following link: www.gov.ie/en/department-of-education/collections/data-on-individual-schools/  In relation to the number of children without a confirmed place at the end of 2023, 2024 and 2025, as the matter relates to a NCSE process, I will arrange for this query to be forwarded to the NCSE for their attention and direct reply.  My department and the NCSE are committed to delivering an education system that is of the highest quality and where every child and young person feels valued and is actively supported and nurtured to reach their full potential.

        "answerText": " Minister of State at the Department of Education and Youth  I propose to take Questions Nos. 475 and 476 together.  The National Council for Special Education (NCSE) is the statutory body responsible for the provision of special education and allocating supports for students with special educational needs.  Almost 1,900 classes have been sanctioned by the NCSE in the last five years, sixteen new special schools have been established and many more expanded. For the 2025/26 school year alone over 400 new special classes have been sanctioned bringing the total number of special classes nationwide to over 3,700. Five new special schools were established and capacity is being expanded in a number of other special schools.  The vast majority of students with special educational needs are supported to attend mainstream classes with their peers. Where students with more complex needs require additional supports, special classes and special school places are provided. These classes are resourced in line with the Special Education Review Committee's recommendations. This ensures that these classes continue to meet the needs of students who are enrolled, and the class is as inclusive as possible in that as many students as possible are accommodated.  Generally, these classes are resourced at a 6:1 student/teacher ratio and two special needs assistants are allocated to each class. For the school years 2022/23, 2023/24 and 2024/25 in County Waterford there were 3 special schools with 271, 276 and 274 pupils enrolled respectively.  The following table shows the number of special classes per county from the 2020/21 to 2025/2026 school years and the percentage increase in the number of special classes. Enrolment data for schools is available on the government website via the following link: www.gov.ie/en/department-of-education/collections/data-on-individual-schools/  In relation to the number of children without a confirmed place at the end of 2023, 2024 and 2025, as the matter relates to a NCSE process, I will arrange for this query to be forwarded to the NCSE for their attention and direct reply.

        "answerText": " Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage  The management and maintenance of local authority housing stock, including pre-letting repairs to vacant properties, the implementation of a planned maintenance programme and carrying out of responsive repairs, are matters for each individual local authority under Section 58 of the Housing Act 1966. Local authorities also have a legal obligation to ensure all of their tenanted properties comply with the provisions of the Housing (Standards for Rented Houses) Regulations 2019.  Accordingly, the number of vacant social homes, and the amounts spent bringing those homes back into use, should be sought directly from the respective local authorities.  That said, my Department's Planned Maintenance and Voids Programme has made €31 million available to local authorities this year to support the refurbishment and re-letting of a minimum of 1,900 homes, and continue the transition from a reactive, voids approach to a planned maintenance approach.  An annualised breakdown of the funding provided to each local authority and the number of properties remediated under the voids programme from 2014 to end-2024 is available at www.gov.ie/en/collection/0906a-other-local-authority-housing-scheme-statistics/#voids-programme.  Local authorities will always have a level of vacancy in their housing stock, which will fluctuate over time, as tenancy surrender and re-letting of stock is a continuous process. Therefore, ongoing data in relation to vacant local authority owned homes is not routinely collated by my Department.  However, statistics in relation to social housing stock, at a point in time, are published by the National Oversight and Audit Commission (NOAC) in their Annual Reports on Performance Indicators in Local Authorities. These reports provide a range of information, including levels of vacancy and average turnaround times for re-letting local authority owned properties. The most recent report for 2024 is available on the NOAC website at: www.noac.ie/noac_publications/report-77-noac-performance-indicator-report-2024/ ",

Patient safety remains at the centre of all hospital activity and elective care scheduling.  To ensure services are provided in a safe, clinically aligned and prioritised way, hospitals follow HSE clinical guidelines and protocols. Cancelled hospital procedures/appointments are, where appropriate, rescheduled as early as possible with priority given to patients requiring time-sensitive and urgent treatment. Patients that are cancelled are rescheduled with the next available appointment based on their clinical prioritisation, with urgent patients prioritised for access.
