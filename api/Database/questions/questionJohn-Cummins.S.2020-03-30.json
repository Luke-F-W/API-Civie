        "answerText": " Minister of State at the Department of Education  As you are aware enabling children with special educational needs to receive an education is a priority for government. Thanks to considerable investment in special education in recent years the vast majority of children with special educational needs are supported to attend mainstream classes with their peers. Where children with more complex needs require additional supports, special classes and special school places are provided.  The National Council for Special Education (NCSE) has responsibility for coordinating and advising on the education provision for children with special educational needs.  Almost 1,700 classes have been sanctioned by the NCSE in the last 5 years, 11 new special schools have been established and many more expanded. For this school year alone over 400 new special classes have been sanctioned bringing the total number of special classes nationwide to 3,336.  Budget 2025 provides funding for another 400 special classes and 300 special school places nationwide.  The attached document provides a breakdown of special classes per county in primary and post-primary schools from the 2019/20 school year to the 2024/25 school year.  Parents seeking special class placements for their children are advised to contact the NCSE locally for planning purposes. Local special educational needs organisers (SENOs) are available to assist and advise parents and can provide details on schools with available special educational places. Parents may contact SENOs directly using the contact details available on the NCSE website.  The NCSE have recently recruited additional SENOs, advisors and team managers. 120 SENOs now operate nationwide. SENOs play an important role in ensuring there is adequate special educational provision within local areas and are currently visiting schools nationwide to conduct planning meetings. Over 1,000 school planning visits have occurred in recent months. These planning visits have been key to the NCSE in determining what new provision can be provided and it is expected that the NCSE will sanction a number of new special classes in the coming weeks.   Special Classes by County 2019-2024  ",

        "answerText": " Minister for Health  I propose to take Questions Nos. 1670 and 1671 together.  As the Deputy may be aware, the Model of Care for Fertility was developed by the Department of Health in conjunction with the HSE’s National Women & Infants Health Programme (NWIHP) in order to ensure that fertility-related issues are addressed through the public health system at the lowest level of clinical intervention necessary.  This Model of Care comprises three stages, starting in primary care (i.e., GPs) and extending into secondary care (i.e., the six Regional Fertility Hubs located across the country) and then, where necessary, AHR (assisted human reproduction) treatment (e.g., IVF (in-vitro fertilisation) and ICSI (intra-cytoplasmic sperm injection)), with patients being referred onwards through structured pathways.  Phase One of the roll-out of the Model of Care has involved the establishment, at secondary care level, of six Regional Fertility Hubs within maternity networks covering the entire country, in order to facilitate the management of a significant proportion of patients presenting with fertility-related issues at this level of intervention. Patients are referred by their GPs to their local Regional Fertility Hub, which provides a range of treatments and interventions.  Phase Two of the roll-out of the Model of Care relates to the introduction of AHR treatment, including IVF, provided through the public health system at tertiary level.  Appropriate funding has been made available to support access to AHR treatment via HSE-approved private providers. As well as IVF and ICSI, this allocation is also being used to provide, initially through private clinics, IUI (intrauterine insemination), which can, for certain cohorts of patients, be a potentially effective, yet less complex and less intrusive form of treatment.  Referrals for AHR treatment by private providers commenced in September 2023. Criteria prospective patients should meet in order to access fully-funded AHR services and the services to be initially funded were agreed by the Department and the HSE and subsequently approved by Government in July 2023. More details on public fertility services, including information on the publicly-funded AHR treatment initiative, are available from the HSE at: www2.hse.ie/conditions/fertility-problems-treatments/fertility-treatment/  As I have previously stated publicly, the access criteria and the AHR treatment scheme generally are being kept under ongoing review as new evidence becomes available and an understanding of how the service provision is working in practice emerges. I have committed to extending the service provision in two particular respects in 2025. However, the specific details in respect of any finalised agreed changes to the access criteria or the scheme more broadly require further extensive consultation between my officials, colleagues in the HSE and also with relevant specialists in the field of reproductive medicine.  I want to reassure the Deputy that my Department and the Government are focused, through the full implementation of the Model of Care for Fertility, on ensuring that patients receive care at the appropriate level of clinical intervention and then those requiring, and eligible for, advanced AHR treatment such as IVF will be able to access same through the public health system.
