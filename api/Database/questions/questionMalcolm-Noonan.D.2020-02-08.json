        "answerText": " Minister for Health  The Health Service Executive (HSE) have advised that COVID-19 continues to pose significant challenges for many service areas. This has unfortunately had unavoidable negative impacts on waiting lists. The HSE continues to work hard to address these issues and find solutions to the difficulties resulting from the ongoing Covid-19 crisis. The HSE is committed to delivering efficient high quality Ophthalmology services to all eligible service users.  The HSE Primary Care Eye Services Review Group Report, published in June 2017, set out current levels of service, models of service provision and the consultation process undertaken with patients, advocates, ophthalmic staff and representative bodies. It also highlighted the limitations of the current model of service delivery, including the impact on waiting lists, and set out the way forward for a significant amount of eye services to be delivered in a primary care setting.  The Report estimated that 60% of existing outpatient activity could be moved to primary care thus enabling hospital services to focus on patients who require more specialist diagnostics or treatments. This Report remains current and the HSE has advised that it will advance the transfer of care for children aged 8+ years to local optometrists, thereby reducing waiting lists and enhancing access to primary eye care services.A project team with a wide-ranging membership was established in late 2019 / early 2020 to progress this initiative. The work of the team was paused due to the requirement to focus resources on the COVID 19 pandemic. However, the project team has been reconvened and is progressing matters in relation to this initiative. ",

My Department defines high speed broadband as a connection with minimum speeds of 30Mbps download and 6Mbps upload.  Under State aid rules, my Department is not permitted to displace commercial investment by intervening in areas where commercial investment exists or is planned, as to do so would be an infringement of these State aid rules. The activities of commercial operators delivering high speed broadband within BLUE areas are not planned or funded by the State and my Department has no statutory authority to intervene in that regard.

        "answerText": " Minister of State at the Department of Health  As I have said previously, the Department is engaging in dialogue with the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform and the HSE in relation to the 2023 Estimates. Until these discussions are concluded it would not be appropriate for me to comment on this matter. Be assured, however, that I am committed to the continued enhancement of mental health services and that this will be reflected in the funding allocated for mental health in 2023.  The Government’s clear commitment to enhancing mental health services, is shown by significant mental health funding increases in recent years. I would note for the Deputy that 2022 saw a record budget for mental health of €1.149 billion, comprising €24 million for new developments, €10 million for mental health initiatives in response to Covid and €13 million for existing levels of service. An additional once off €10 million was announced on Budget Day to further support the mental health sector.  I am pleased to have secured an unprecedented level of funding, totalling, €1.149 billion, for mental health in this year’s budget. This Budget, which is the largest mental health budget in the history of the state, is supporting the continued implementation of new developments under our national mental health policy, Sharing the Vision , including out of hours supports, CAMHS services, crisis resolution team, the national clinical programmes, and specialist mental health services for older people.  Budget Day also saw the addition of once off €10 million for mental health purposes. €1m of this was provided for MyMind to continue to deliver free of charge counselling sessions, to clients impacted negatively by the COVID-19 pandemic. This scheme has been extended to those affected by the Ukrainian crisis and defective concrete blocks in Donegal and Mayo. €1m was also provided to Mental Health Ireland to manage a grant scheme on behalf of the Department for community and voluntary agencies promoting mental health and well-being.  Funding allocated to mental health services in recent years has allowed for the continued investment in the mental health national clinical programmes and models of care, which has led to significant service improvements, including the full implementation of specialist perinatal mental health network provided for and the on-going expansion of specialist mental health teams for eating disorders, ADHD in adults, and dual diagnosis.  Importantly, as budgets increase, we need to ensure that we have plans and strategies in place so that those resources are used effectively and efficiently to the benefit of people using our mental health services. All aspects of mental health services are being improved and developed, through Sharing the Vision in the short to longer term. Sharing the Vision aims to enhance the provision of mental health services and supports across a broad continuum, from mental health promotion, prevention, and early intervention to acute and specialist mental health service delivery, during the period 2020-2030.

I wish to highlight, as Minister for Finance, I am precluded from intervening in commercial and operational decisions in any particular bank, even one in which the State has a shareholding. Decisions in this regard, including AIB's original announcement on 19 July 2022 to re-purpose 70 of its branches across the country, are the sole responsibility of the board and management of the banks, which must be run on an independent and commercial basis. The bank's independence is protected by a Relationship Framework which is a legally binding document that cannot be changed unilaterally. This framework, which is publicly available, was insisted upon by the European Commission to protect competition in the Irish market.  On Friday 22 July 2022, AIB, having recognised the customer and public unease its original announcement had caused, announced that it has decided not to proceed with the proposed changes to the 70 branches and that cash services would remain in these branches. AIB will continue to retain its 170-strong branch network in its entirety and will also continue to offer banking services through its relationship with at An Post at its 920 post offices nationwide.  Banks have a key role in maintaining the flow of cash through the economy and ensuring appropriate access to retail banking services for all in society, including the vulnerable. I would like to point out that access to cash and branch services is a key focus of the work of the Retail Banking Review, which is currently underway. The public consultation process, which is part of the Review, sought the views of all stakeholders, including members of the public, in this regard. The public consultation concluded on 8 July 2022. The Banking Review team is reviewing the responses received in preparing the draft report which is due with me in November 2022. "

Their drive and dedication have been key components in our managing of the pandemic.  I acknowledge the MLSA’s claim for pay parity between medical scientists and clinical biochemists. As you may be aware, the current public service agreement, Building Momentum 2021-2022, includes the process of Sectoral Bargaining, to address outstanding claims such as this one. Despite continued engagement between the MLSA and Health management since November 2021, and several proposals being explored, it has not been possible to agree a route to fully resolve the longstanding claim due to insufficient funds being available through Sectoral Bargaining.  This matter was escalated through the dispute resolution mechanisms under Building Momentum and considered twice by the Public Service Agreement Group (PSAG) on 31 March and 11 May. PSAG recommended that this matter be referred to the WRC for urgent engagement and that industrial peace be maintained. The MLSA met with Health management on May 17th at the WRC, however, no resolution was reached.  Following engagement at the Labour Court on May 25th , the parties have agreed to reconvene at the WRC for a further final engagement.  This engagement will take place within a three week period. Any outstanding issues that cannot be resolved through the WRC process will be referred to the Labour Court.  All industrial action will be suspended throughout the engagement process and pending any Labour Court Recommendation.  I welcome the engagement that took place through the Labour Court and the suspension of industrial action. ",

        "answerText": " Minister for Health  The Government is committed to providing accessible and affordable healthcare to all. There are a range of services in place to protect individuals and families from excessive costs for their medical needs.  Under the Health (Pricing and Supply of Medical Goods) Act 2013, the Health Service Executive (HSE) has statutory responsibility for decisions on pricing and reimbursement of medicinal products. The HSE also administers the General Medical Services scheme and the community drug schemes. The formal HSE Reimbursement list is the same for the General Medical Services (GMS) scheme and the Drug Payment Scheme (DPS)..  Under the DPS, no individual or family pays more than €80 a month towards the cost of approved prescribed medicines. The scheme significantly reduces the cost burden for families and individuals with ongoing expenditure on medicines.  People who cannot, without undue hardship, arrange for the provision of medical services for themselves and their dependants may be eligible for a medical card under the GMS scheme. In accordance with the provisions of the Health Act 1970 (as amended), eligibility for a medical card is determined by the HSE. Medical card eligibility is primarily based on an assessment of means and is not granted on the basis of any particular condition.  In certain circumstances the HSE may exercise discretion and grant a medical card, even though an applicant exceeds the income guidelines, where he or she faces difficult financial circumstances, such as extra costs arising from illness. The HSE afford applicants the opportunity to furnish supporting documentation to determine whether undue hardship exists and to fully take account of all relevant circumstances that may benefit them in assessment, including medical evidence of costs and certain expenses.  In circumstances where an applicant is still over the income limit for a medical card, they are then assessed for a GP visit card, which entitles the applicant to GP visits without charge. GP visit cards do not cover charges for consultants, blood tests, visits to the Emergency Department, or the cost of prescribed medicines dispensed.  Individuals may also be entitled to claim tax relief on the cost of their medical expenses. This includes medicines prescribed by a doctor, dentist, or consultant. Relief is at the standard tax rate of 20%. ",

        "answerText": " Minister for Health  The Long Term Illness (LTI) scheme was established under Section 59(3) of the Health Act 1970 (as amended). Regulations were made in 1971, 1973 and 1975, prescribing 16 illnesses covered by the scheme. These are: acute leukaemia; mental handicap; cerebral palsy; mental illness (in a person under 16); cystic fibrosis; multiple sclerosis; diabetes insipidus; muscular dystrophies; diabetes mellitus; parkinsonism; epilepsy; phenylketonuria; haemophilia; spina bifida; hydrocephalus; and conditions arising from the use of Thalidomide.  Under the scheme, patients receive drugs, medicines, and medical and surgical appliances directly related to the treatment of their illness, free of charge.  There are currently no plans to extend the list of illnesses covered by the scheme. However, a review of the current eligibility framework, including the basis for existing hospital and medication charges, is to be carried out under commitments given in the Sláintecare Implementation Strategy.  In the meantime, for people who are not eligible for the LTI scheme, there are other arrangements which protect them from excessive medicine costs.  Under the Drugs Payment Scheme (DPS), no individual or family pays more than €80 a month towards the cost of approved prescribed medicines. The scheme significantly reduces the cost burden for families and individuals with ongoing expenditure on medicines.  People who cannot, without undue hardship, arrange for the provision of medical services for themselves and their dependants may be eligible for a medical card. In accordance with the provisions of the Health Act 1970 (as amended), eligibility for a medical card is determined by the HSE. In certain circumstances the HSE may exercise discretion and grant a medical card, even though an applicant exceeds the income guidelines, where he or she faces difficult financial circumstances, such as extra costs arising from illness. The HSE afford applicants the opportunity to furnish supporting documentation to determine whether undue hardship exists and to fully take account of all relevant circumstances that may benefit them in assessment, including medical evidence of costs and certain expenses.  In circumstances where an applicant is still over the income limit for a medical card, they are then assessed for a GP visit card, which entitles the applicant to GP visits without charge.

Guides in the Office of Public Works are technically classified as “industrial employees” and are recruited to the OPW in a non-established capacity. They enjoy the same Terms & Conditions as “industrial employees” in other areas of the civil service.  A non-established State employee is a person employed in a whole-time capacity by a Government Department or Office who is not an established civil servant. Non-established State employees are not covered by the Civil Service Regulations Act, 1956.  There has been some progress by the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform in reducing the differences in Terms and Conditions between these categories, which I welcome.   For example, there is no material difference between established and non-established Pensions for staff recruited since 1 January, 2013.  As with all non-established staff working in Civil Service Departments and Offices, OPW Guides recruited before 1 January, 2013 are members of the pre-2013 Non-Established Public Service Pension Scheme, and those recruited from 1 January, 2013, are members of the Single Public Service Pension Scheme.  Established staff recruited before 1 April, 2004 have a minimum retirement age of 60, while that of non-established staff is 65. The minimum retirement age for all staff recruited after 1 April, 2004, whether established or non-established, is 65/66.  Like all non-established State employees, Guides in the OPW have access to all open competitions for posts in the civil and public service. It is, however, the case that competitions are initiated under the Civil Service Regulations Act are confined to staff who have Civil Servant status. ",

In particular, the Department has recently included in the Traffic Signs Manual warning signs to inform motorists of the need to keep a safe lateral distance when overtaking cyclists. It has funded a programme for the provision of such signs by road authorities. It is also working with TII to consider suitable designs for the provision of segregated cycle facilities on higher speed roads.

        "answerText": " Minister of State at the Department of Transport  Making the wearing of protective clothing and helmets compulsory for cyclists is an issue which has arisen a number of times over the years.  It is a long standing Government policy to recommend and promote the wearing of helmets.  The Rules of the Road booklet encourages the use of cycle helmets and draws attention to their safety benefits, and the Road Safety Authority, the agency responsible for public education and awareness, strongly encourages their use.  To create a statutory obligation on the wearing of reflective clothing would entail making it a criminal offence under Road Traffic legislation for any person guilty of not wearing high visibility clothing.  A person in breach of such a provision would fall to be issued with a fixed charge notice or summonsed to court, depending on what procedure would be put in place for the processing of such offences.  I believe that the wearing of such clothing is best pursued by way of educational and publicity campaigns rather than by pursuing a punitive approach to the issue.  In this regard, the Road Safety Authority (RSA), which has responsibility for the promotion of road safety awareness, advertising and the dissemination of road safety information, undertakes a number of campaigns to promote awareness among pedestrians and cyclists of the need for visibility on our roads.  International evidence is that mandatory helmet legislation acts as a major disincentive to cycling such that the net impact of the legislation on public health is significantly negative.  Therefore I do not propose to introduce such legislation.

These include road, rail and ferry services provided by companies such as Bus Átha Cliath, Bus Éireann and Iarnród Éireann, as well as Luas and services provided by over 80 private transport operators. There are currently approximately 1,003,000 customers with direct eligibility. The estimated expenditure on free travel in 2021 is €95 million.  While the Report of the Oireachtas Committee on Transport that the Deputy refers to did recommend  uncoupling the link between receipt of particular social welfare payments and eligibility for the free travel scheme, it did not specifically recommend a cost analysis of establishing the free travel scheme as a standalone directly applicable benefit.  In any event, as explained in response to Parliamentary Question 251 of 8 July 2021, it would not be possible for my Department to conduct such a cost analysis on the basis of the Report as my Department would need in-depth details of any proposed changes including, but not limited to, the new qualifying criteria which would be envisaged as being applicable for the scheme; any processes, systems or dependencies associated with such criteria; the type of travel pass that would be issued in particular circumstances (e.g., single or companion pass etc.); the services to which the revised free travel pass would apply; the number of journeys made using the free travel pass and the means by which this would be assessed; the prevailing fares; and the type of journeys undertaken, i.e., rail, bus or Luas, etc.  Furthermore, implementation of the proposed recommendation would entail a fundamental change to the very nature of the free travel scheme and a significant increase in the numbers qualifying for the scheme – beyond the customer base of the Department – the details of which would not be available to this Department. In essence, uncoupling the link between receipt of particular social welfare payments and eligibility for the free travel scheme would so fundamentally alter the scheme that it would move it away from the Department of Social Protection to become a general transport initiative.  It could also be expected that extensive negotiations, including negotiations around levels of recompense would have to be undertaken with transport operators to ensure their continued participation in such a considerably revised scheme.  I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy. ",

There are currently approximately 999,000 customers with direct eligibility. The estimated expenditure on free travel in 2021 is €95 million.

My Department has not carried out a cost analysis of establishing the free travel scheme as a directly applicable benefit and therefore cannot provide the estimated cost of such a measure or the projected staff resources required.  Undertaking such a cost analysis would not be simple as it would depend on a range of factors including the new qualifying criteria which the Deputy envisages as being applicable for the scheme, any processes, systems or dependencies associated with such criteria, the type of travel pass issued (e.g., single or companion pass etc.), the number of journeys made using the free travel pass, the prevailing fares, and the type of journeys undertaken, i.e., rail, bus or Luas.

Deputy Malcolm Noonan asked the Minister for Health her views on whether the temporary assistance payment scheme for nursing homes will continue beyond June 2021 in view of the fact that the COVID-19 Nursing Homes Expert Panel: Final Report requires the nursing home sector to implement considerablere source-intensive recommendations; and if he will make a statement on the matter. [30511/21] ",
        "answerText": " Minister of State at the Department of Health  I propose to take Questions Nos. 130 and 173 together.  The Temporary Assistance Payment Scheme (TAPS) was established in April 2020 as a temporary administrative measure in response to the challenges faced by the nursing home sector at the start of the pandemic. As the pandemic continued, additional support measures for private and voluntary nursing homes have been delivered through the Health Service Executive (HSE).  As of 11th June 2021, 7,148 claims had been submitted as part of the Scheme. In total, €134.5 million has been made available under TAPS between 2020 and 2021.  Due to the ongoing high level of risk associated with COVID-19 during this period, the Department of Health responded by extending the scheme twice, far beyond the originally planned timescale of three months. The further extension of the scheme was outlined in the Government’s Plan 'Resilience and Recovery 2020-2021: Plan for Living with COVID-19', published in September 2020. This provided reassurance of the Scheme’s availability and a planned timeframe of operation to the end of June 2021.  The cessation of TAPS at the end of June, as planned and previously announced was communicated with all relevant stakeholders, including Nursing Homes Ireland – the national representative body for the private and voluntary nursing home sector.  There has been a marked improvement in the status of the virus in the community and in nursing homes due to the rollout of the National Vaccination Programme – COVID-19 cases and outbreaks in nursing homes are now at a very low level compared with the first quarter of the year and, overall, the epidemiological situation is very positive. It is the Department’s understanding that currently there is one open outbreak in a nursing home.  (Please note that the cyber-attack on the HSE on 14 May 2021 has prevented the routine notification of cases, associated deaths and outbreaks of COVID-19 to the Computerised Infectious Disease Reporting (CIDR) system. As an interim measure, provisional epidemiological reports are being prepared but have not undergone the data validation procedures undertaken through CIDR. For this reason, data continues to be provisional at this time.)  The Scheme has fulfilled its temporary purpose of providing financial support to nursing homes to address COVID-19. Although the risk is greatly reduced, it has not been completely eliminated, therefore the outbreak assistance element of the Scheme will continue to be available to nursing homes until the end of 2021. Availability of outbreak assistance is subject to the overall sanctioned amount of €42m for 2021.  The substantial package of non-financial supports outlined below will continue to be provided for the time being:  - Provision of Personal Protective Equipment (PPE). The continued supply of PPE is a key support mechanism and will be provided in line with clinical and public health recommendations;  - The COVID-19 Response Teams established to support Public Health Outbreak teams covering all residential services as well as home support settings. All stakeholders, including the COVID-19 Nursing Homes Expert Panel, have highlighted the significant contribution these new teams have made to supporting nursing homes throughout the pandemic;  - The HSE Temporary Accommodation Scheme;  - HSE training and development resources, including the opening up of HSeLanD to private and voluntary providers.  - IPC support and advice;  - The substantial suite of publicly available guidance developed to support the sector.  These measures and supports reflect a significant investment by the State to support nursing homes and other services and measures, such as the COVID-19 Response Teams, and are a clear signal of the work that is ongoing to integrate the wider health system.  Nursing homes, like all other service providers, should continue to follow and apply enhanced public health advice and guidance as required in line with the pandemic risk. All nursing homes, as registered providers with HIQA, have well established obligations under the legal framework in terms of the delivery of safe care to residents. Nursing homes are required, by law, to comply with current infection, prevention and control standards - these standards have been in operation since 2018. Good and effective IPC procedures should be in place across the entire health and social care service as a matter of course  In February 2021, a revised plan 'Resilience and Recovery 2021 Plan: The Path Ahead' was published by the Government. This plan recognises the need for longer-term reform of both older persons and nursing home care, broadly reflecting the lessons learned from the COVID-19 Nursing Homes Expert Panel and the pandemic. However, these structural reforms, including the policy and regulatory framework, extend beyond the scope of a temporary financial support scheme aimed at a specific, time-limited public health objective.

[28075/21] ",
        "answerText": " Minister for Health  The Health Information and Quality Authority (HIQA) is the independent statutory authority responsible for registering and inspecting residential services for older people and people with a disability, and children’s special care units. The Health Act 2007 (as amended) empowers the Chief Inspector to carry out this function through the processes of registration, continual monitoring and inspection and, where necessary, the application of its powers of enforcement.  Following inspection visits, HIQA inspectors produce inspection reports which outline the level of regulatory compliance and non-compliance. The inspection reports are then issued to the service provider following which, the service provider must put in place action plans to address any areas of concern. Service providers are subject to ongoing monitoring and all of the required improvements are inspected again by HIQA in subsequent visits to ensure compliance.  In the interest of openness and transparency, HIQA publishes its inspection reports on the HIQA website where they are available for examination by the general public. The exception is in relation to centres with very low resident numbers where, to protect the privacy of residents, the reports are finalised but are not published.  There is no statutory timeline for the publication of reports. However, in preparing reports, providers are afforded a right of reply so that they can identify any factual inaccuracies or highlight any judgements that they believe are disproportionate. The inspection report is not finalised until this process has been completed. During this process, the provider is asked not to distribute the report until the report has been finalised. This passage of time is considered appropriate in the context of the process set out.  The regulations do require providers to inform residents about how to access the reports when they have been finalised. For example, the Care and Support Regulations for centres for people with disabilities (SSI 367 of 2013), regulation 20(2)(d) requires the provider to include how to access any inspection reports on the centre in their residents’ guide.  I am aware that on 3 June 2021 HIQA issued written notice of a decision to cancel the registration of Camphill Communities of Ireland (CCoI) Duffcarrig residential centre within 28 days. As CCoI do not intend to contest the decision, the HSE is working closely on a transition plan in relation to the Duffcarrig centre with a view to identifying an alternative provider. I understand that the HSE and the provider have met with the parent representatives of the service users concerned and the focus of the HSE is to ensure that residents receive safe services during the transitional period.

        "answerText": " Minister for Tourism, Culture, Arts, Gaeltacht, Sport and Media  The Online Safety and Media Regulation Bill will, among other things, establish a regulatory framework for online safety to be overseen by an Online Safety Commissioner as part of a wider Media Commission. The goal of this regulatory framework will be to tackle the availability of defined categories of harmful online content through systemic oversight over how certain online services deliver and moderate the user-generated content on their platforms.  These defined categories of harmful online content include content by which a person commits a criminal offence and a number of categories of potentially harmful content, these being:  - Content by which a person engages in serious cyberbullying;  - Content by which a person promotes suicide or self-harm, and,  - Content by which a person promotes behaviour associated with eating disorders.  These categories concerning potentially harmful content are carefully defined in the General Scheme to ensure that they deal with the most egregious content and respect other fundamental rights such as freedom of expression. These definitions are being refined during detailed legal drafting of the Bill by the Office of the Attorney General.  Provision is also made in the Bill for the addition of further categories of harmful online content in the future. This process will involve a proposal by the Media Commission, informed by stakeholder consultation, and both Government and Oireachtas approval. The Media Commission will be tasked with keeping a close eye on emerging online harms which may be suitable to be dealt with under the regulatory framework for online safety.  The purpose of this provision is to future-proof the legislation to create a statutory process by which emerging online harms such as the issue raised by the Deputy may be examined for potential inclusion as a further category of harmful online content. This will help to avoid the need for ad-hoc primary legislation to deal with emerging harms in the future.  It's intended that the Online Safety and Media Regulation Bill will be enacted this year. The Bill is on the Government priority list for publication during the current legislative session, which ends in July 2021. At the same time, the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Media, Tourism, Arts, Culture, Sport and the Gaeltacht is conducting pre-legislative scrutiny of the General Scheme of the Bill. The timeline for this is a matter for the Committee. ",

In general, access to a free travel pass for those aged under 66 is linked to a person being in receipt of certain primary Social Protection payments such as Disability Allowance, Invalidity Pension, Carer’s Allowance, Blind Pension and Partial Capacity Benefit.  Extending the free travel scheme to people with epilepsy during the period in which they are disallowed from driving cannot be considered in isolation.  There are a range of disabilities and medical conditions that can prevent a person from holding a driving licence and to award a free travel pass to any one of these conditions in isolation would immediately result in calls for all people who are not allowed to hold a driving licence because of their medical condition to receive the free travel pass and could result in challenges under the Equal Status Act.  If the Free Travel scheme were to be extended to all people who are not allowed to drive due to their disability, regardless of whether they receive a qualifying payment, a medical assessment process would be required for all such applications, significantly changing the nature of the scheme and requiring additional administrative processes to be put in place in order to adjudicate eligibility.  Significant extra funding would also be required and, accordingly, it could only be considered in the context of overall budgetary negotiations.  Under the Supplementary Welfare Allowance scheme, my Department may award a travel supplement, where the circumstances of the particular case so warrant.  The supplement is intended to assist with ongoing or recurring travel costs that cannot be met from the client’s own resources and are deemed to be necessary.  Every decision is based on consideration of the circumstances of the individual case, taking account of the nature and extent of the need and of the resources of the person concerned.  I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy. ",

This Department monitors inspections carried out by HIQA in relation to Child Protection Services, Foster Care Services, Special Care and Tusla run Children's Residential Centres.When HIQA carries out an inspection Tusla are informed of the findings by way of an inspection report. The service provider will need to develop an action plan to address areas for improvement of deficits (if any). Copies of inspection reports, and action plans, are published on HIQA’s website. In cases where reports are not published to protect a resident’s privacy, residents and service users are still entitled to have a copy of the report.It is appropriate that providers are given time to develop an action plan in response to an inspection and prior to publication of the report. This also allows the inspecting body to follow up as necessary prior to publishing a report.In addition service users wishing to express concerns or issues have access to complaints/feedback procedures in the centres as well as access to Tusla complaints procedures and an assigned social worker that they can share their issues with.  Upon publication the inspection report will still detail any non-compliance with relevant standards and the actions planned or already taken to address areas of concern. I wish to advise that the answer provided is based on my Department's experience with HIQA reports. The recent cyber attack has had an impact on Department of Health systems and has impaired their functionality. ",

In my mind that rejuvenation means increasing the ‘liveability’ and quality of life for all citizens who live or visit our cities, towns and villages and making them centres of commercial, social and cultural activity for their hinterlands, whether that hinterland is urban or rural in nature.  I acknowledge that this issue is a whole of Government one and indeed one for which the Deputy’s own Department has an important role. I understand that his Department is developing new ‘sustainable settlement guidance’ to offer practical and targeted guidance towards improving practice as regards sustainable settlement planning and best practice urban design, including reducing the impact of parking on the public realm. This will type of guidance will support work underway in relation to the ‘Town Centres First' initiative which is being led by his Department and the Department for Rural and Community Development, an initiative which I very much support.  A key part of that rejuvenation of our urban centres means improving the public realm and that is recognized in the National Planning Framework through its references to same for each of the five cities and also its specific National Policy Objective 18a in respect of rural towns. I note this particular National Policy Objective is also supported within the recommendations of Our Rural Future – Rural Development Policy 2021 to 2025 which was launched this week.  Interventions in our urban centres must therefore be considered with regard to whether that intervention will improve the ‘liveability’ of the area or detract from it. I believe that a key intervention in that regard within the ambit of my Department is to increase the funding available to support improved active travel infrastructure – walking and cycling – and I am delighted that we have increased that funding and are now seeing active travel specific funding being rolled out across the country.  The Deputy may also wish to know that issue of parking in urban centres and its influence on people’s choice of transport mode is something that was raised by consultees during my Department’s consultation period on our review of sustainable mobility policy and it was also considered as part of the Five Cities Demand Management Study, which will be published very shortly.  It is my clear position that we need to promote sustainable mobility and prioritise interventions that assist, and not hinder, that promotion. ",

Ireland is still experiencing high levels of infection across the country and the health service remains under pressure. Level 5 restrictive measures therefore remain in place. Any measures introduced at any level of the Plan are aimed at limiting the spread and damage of COVID-19, and are necessary to protect our key priorities of supporting and maintaining health and social care services, keeping education and childcare services open and protecting the most vulnerable members of our communities.  The ‘Framework for Restrictive Measures in Response to COVID-19’provides for restrictions on gatherings. The number of people allowed to gather in different scenarios in the plan is based on a review of international practice and the judgment of public health experts. It seeks to balance the risks of different types of gatherings against the desire to allow normal activities to proceed in so far as possible. The measures in place for each level reflect the prevailing disease situation and recognise that we can and must prioritise some activities over others.  The Framework sets out when it is considered that organised outdoor events can take place. At Level 5, no organised outdoor gatherings should take place.  I and my Cabinet colleagues recognise the immense sacrifices that are being made by people across the country at this difficult time. That includes the many people who are affected by their inability to attend church in the way they have been used to. However, there has been significant engagement and solidarity from the Catholic Church and other Faiths at all stages throughout this pandemic to ensure the protection of individuals and communities from COVID-19.  Significant progress has been made on suppressing the virus due to the huge effort of our citizens. By working together, we have saved lives and limited the impact of the disease on society in Ireland. We all must continue to do everything possible to avoid the virus spreading. ",

Where COVID-19 is detected in an adult in the community, either through symptomatic or close contact testing and when initial contact tracing confirms that they work in a school setting, Public Health are immediately notified and the Public Health Risk Assessment (PHRA) is initiated with the school by HSE School Teams in a similar way.  The findings of the Public Health Risk Assessment (PHRA), which is undertaken by a Public Health Doctor, where a confirmed case has attended school whilst infectious, assesses many different aspects of disease transmission as laid out in the Schools Pathway document and this determines the identification of close contacts. This enables the most accurate and effective determination of the relevant information allowing tailored, measured protection and prevention of Covid-19 in schools. "

There has been a 90% increase in the apprentice population since 2015.  Existing off-the-job training facilities, particularly in Electrical and Plumbing apprenticeships had been coming under increasing pressure to facilitate the rapid growth in apprentice population.  The COVID-19 related suspension of face to face training for craft apprentices in Training Centres, Institutes of Technology and Technological Universities has had a significant impact on waiting times.  When permissible, on-site practical training is operating at approximately 50% normal capacity to ensure adherence to public health guidance.  Since January 11th training facilities have been closed again however education and training providers have been able to front-load theoretical training online for some groups of apprentices to ensure that their training continues, albeit not in the important practical elements of their course.  A phased return to onsite training has commenced for apprentices who have been assessed as time critical at all phases of their apprenticeship.  This largely impacts on those apprentices who were close to completion of a phase of training when training was suspended in January 2021.  While different sectors will have demands for on-the-job availability  of apprentices at different time-points in the year, it is important to provide the opportunity for apprentices to complete their porgramme in a timely manner and every effort is being made within the system to facilitate their progress.  In addition to the urgent work on returning apprentices to onsite training, SOLAS and the HEA are working on the development of additional training capacity across education and training providers with the objective of tackling the waiting lists and ensuring that apprentices complete their training as quickly as possible.  I recently approved €20M in capital expenditure to facilitate an additional 4,000 places across the system in the coming period.

The Covid-19 pandemic has had a profound impact across society especially for older people. It is recognised that the necessary public health protective measures, such as the need to reduce social contacts, can have adverse effects on social, psychological and emotional wellbeing. The availability of vaccines brings great hope and will play a critical role in protecting the population, especially those most at risk such as older people, against COVID-19. The advanced stage of the vaccination rollout in nursing homes provides an opportunity for cautious incremental modification in some public health measures, including visiting measures.  New visitation guidance was published on 12 March and came into effect on 22 March 2021. The new guidance incorporates early learning from the positive impact of the vaccine rollout nationally and internationally and will provide enhanced opportunity for visiting in nursing homes across all levels of the Government’s Plan “COVID-19 Resilience and Recovery 2021 - The Path Ahead”.  While the guidance in place had provided for visiting on critical and compassionate grounds this new guidance now expands the scope of visiting on general compassionate grounds as well as further refining the guidance across levels 1 to 5, which now provides at Levels 3, 4 and 5, subject to risk assessment and no open outbreak, that residents may be facilitated to receive:  - Two visits per week , where 8 out of 10 of every resident and healthcare worker in the nursing home has completed their vaccination schedule.  The guidance re-emphasises specific critical and compassionate circumstances such as end of life on which additional visiting can be facilitated. It further notes that the duration of visiting on critical and compassionate grounds should be as flexible as possible subject to the ability of the nursing home to manage the visiting safely. At all times vigilance on the general infection prevention measures must be maintained. The guidance will be kept under continuing review as new evidence and data emerges.  It is important to note that nursing home providers are ultimately responsible for the safe care of their residents. Under Regulation 11 of the Health Act 2007 (Care and Welfare of Residents in Designated Centres for Older People) Regulations 2013 it is the legal responsibility of each registered provider to make arrangements for a resident to receive visitors, having regard to any risks that may present for the resident or other residents. Public health guidance has been developed in order to assist and support providers in this regard.  I have written to all nursing home providers, through HIQA’s communication portal, to emphasise the need for all providers to follow the revised guidance on visitation. I have also met with HIQA on this matter to stress the importance of implementation of the guidance. The adoption of a holistic and person-centred approach, noting the key role that visiting, social connections and communication with family and friends has in the context of residents’ overall health and wellbeing must be sustained. I expect every effort to be made to ensure visits are facilitated to the greatest extent possible, in line with the revised guidance and public health advice. Providers are also encouraged to frequently communicate with residents and families on the matter of visiting and to respond to phone calls by family members, in so far as is practicable, given the constraints on staff.

Dedicated multidisciplinary school teams led by public health professionals, working with teams from the Department of Education and school inspectors have been established to support school principals to identify issues as they emerge and work in a collaborative manner.  The Health Protection Surveillance Centre has published Guidance for Educational Settings relating to the management of Covid-19 in school settings. This guidance, which includes protocols relating to the management of close contacts, is available at: https://www.hpsc.ie/a-z/respiratory/coronavirus/novelcoronavirus/guidance/educationguidance/  This definition takes into consideration the findings of the Public Health Risk Assessment (PHRA) which is undertaken at all educational facilities where a confirmed case has been identified.  The application of this risk assessment in the school setting is dynamic and adaptable as new information becomes available, which enables the testing strategy to evolve as the situation unfolds. The measures that are in place are robust, and the safety of staff and pupils is of paramount concern.  It should also be noted that schools must have a Covid-19 Response Plan and a Covid policy in place.

        "answerText": " Minister for Finance  As the Deputy is aware, as Minister for Finance I have no role in the day to day operations of any bank operating within the State including banks in which the State has a shareholding. I'm precluded from intervening on behalf of any individual customer in any particular bank. Decisions in relation to commercial matters are the sole responsibility of the board and management of the banks, which must be run on an independent and commercial basis. The independence of banks in which the state has a shareholding is protected by Relationship Frameworks which are legally binding documents that cannot be changed unilaterally. These frameworks, which are publicly available, were insisted upon by the European Commission to protect competition in the Irish market.  The application of interest rate charges is solely a commercial matter for the board and management of each bank.  Deposit balances and liquidity in general has risen significantly across the banking system in Europe in recent years as the ECB has continued to provide additional funds through their asset purchase schemes and long term refinancing operations. This has been further exacerbated by the Covid-19 pandemic as households continue to stay at home and save and businesses defer investment decisions. This excess liquidity which has grown significantly in the European system has to go somewhere and in large part it gets placed back on deposit with the ECB who charge the banks -0.50%. The application of negative deposit rates by the ECB has resulted in European banks incurring a consequent cost on deposit accounts. The Irish banks are impacted in a similar way to their European counterparts. The banks across Europe have looked to pass some of the costs associated with negative rates to deposit holders with larger balances. The Irish banks are no different in this regard.  In passing on some of these costs it is important to note that banks cannot differentiate between customers in different sectors and for that reason the approach taken is to apply charges based on the size of the deposit balance.

Deputy Malcolm Noonan asked the Minister for Finance if his attention has been drawn to the difficulties for those buying homes in respect of mortgage approvals lasting for only six months in view of current restrictions on the building industry causing delays in home completions (details supplied); if such mortgage holders will have to reapply for their mortgages through no fault of their own; and if he will make a statement on the matter. [11732/21] ",
        "answerText": " Minister for Finance  I have maintained contact with the BPFI and lenders on the measures they have put in place to assist their customers who are economically impacted by COVID-19. In relation to the particular issue of new mortgage lending, the main retail banks previously confirmed that they are considering mortgage applications and mortgage drawdowns in relation to their customers who were impacted by COVID-19 on a case by case basis and that they are taking a fair and balanced approach. Lenders continue to process mortgage applications and have supports in place to assist customers impacted by COVID-19. Therefore, if mortgage applicants have any queries or concerns about the impact of COVID-19 on their mortgage application or a mortgage 'approval-in-principle' they should in the first instance contact their lender directly on the matter.  Regarding the particular issue of extending the period of a mortgage 'approval in principle', the Central Bank has advised that there are no specific regulatory requirements relating to the duration of an 'approval in principle'. That is a commercial and business matter for individual lenders. However, the Central Bank advises that when a lender offers a mortgage to a consumer, the Consumer Protection Code provides that the lender must include the length of time for which the mortgage offer is valid in the offer document.  More generally there are certain consumer protection requirements which govern the provision of mortgage credit to consumers. For example, the European Union (Consumer Mortgage Credit Agreements) Regulations 2016 (CMCAR) provide that, before concluding a mortgage credit agreement, a lender must make a thorough assessment of the consumer’s creditworthiness with a view to verifying the prospect of the consumer being able to meet his or her obligations under the credit agreement. The CMCAR further provide that a lender should only make credit available to a consumer where the result of the creditworthiness assessment indicates that the consumer’s obligations resulting from the credit agreement are likely to be met in the manner required under that agreement. The assessment of creditworthiness must be carried out on the basis of information on the consumer’s income and expenses and other financial and economic circumstances which are necessary, sufficient and proportionate.  In addition, the Central Bank’s Consumer Protection Code 2012 imposes ‘Knowing the Consumer and Suitability’ requirements on lenders. Under these requirements, lenders are required to assess affordability of credit and the suitability of a product or service based on the individual circumstances of each borrower. The Code specifies that the affordability assessment must include consideration of the information gathered on the borrower’s personal circumstances and financial situation. Furthermore, where a lender refuses a mortgage application, the CMCAR requires that the lender must inform the consumer without delay of the refusal. In addition, the Code requires that the lender must clearly outline to the consumer the reasons why the credit was not approved, and provide these reasons on paper if requested.  If a mortgage applicant is not satisfied with how a regulated entity is dealing with them, or they believe that the regulated entity is not following the requirements of the Central Bank’s codes and regulations or other financial services law, they should make a complaint directly to the regulated entity. If they are still not satisfied with the response from the regulated entity, the response to their complaint from the regulated entity is required to include details for the borrower on how to refer their complaint to the Financial Services and Pensions Ombudsman.

        "answerText": " Minister for Defence  I propose to take Questions Nos. 376, 383 and 386 to 389, inclusive, together.  The COVID-19 vaccine Allocation Strategy was developed by the National Immunisation Advisory Committee (NIAC) and the Department of Health, endorsed by the National Public Health Emergency Team (NPHET), and approved by Government on 8 December 2020. It sets out a provisional list of groups for vaccination.  The Defence Forces has established vaccine prioritisation which is in line with this national allocation strategy. Initial Vaccination priority is for Defence Force personnel who are providing front line support to the HSE and National Ambulance Service in the national effort to combat COVID 19.  Those personnel already deployed on Peacekeeping duties will be vaccinated on their return in accordance with the Defence Force prioritisation within the national allocation strategy.  Personnel selected for deployment to overseas missions over the coming months will fall into a prioritised grouping, and the intention is that they will be vaccinated against COVID-19 prior to deployment, subject to availability of the vaccine which is coordinated through the HSE. In this regard, I am advised that the vaccination of Defence Forces personnel due to deploy to the EU Training Mission in Mali later this month has already commenced. ",
