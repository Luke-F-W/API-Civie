        "answerText": " Deputy Ruairí Ó Murchú  What engagement has there been with relevant Departments and agencies, including Tusla? I am talking about the recommendations following the national review panel, NRP, report on Kyran Durnin. We have had a large number of child protection issues, including in respect of Vadym Davydenko and Daniel Aruebose, and the shocking events surrounding the brutal assault on a ten-year-old girl who had been in care. What I am looking for is information specifically on the NRP report and assurance that the recommendations will be acted upon. Beyond that, I seek the timeline for the rest of the reports and assurance that we have the proper framework in play. I am aware that the Minister has legislation and other measures planned. \n Deputy Norma Foley  I appreciate the Deputy raising this matter. Any case of a missing child is of enormous concern to the Government, everybody in this House and others across wider society. I know he agrees with me on that. We are always conscious that at the heart of this case is a young child. All of us, including the general public, are devastated that a young child could go missing for such a long time.  The NRP delivered its report on the review of the Kyran Durnin case to the Department on 29 October last. I have been clear in my wish to publish the report in full on its completion. However, I was also clear at the outset that I would seek the advice and expert legal opinion of the Attorney General. I have done that. The Attorney General has determined that it would not be possible to publish the report at this time given the potential to prejudice any potential prosecutions. It may be possible to publish the report in the future, depending on the advice of the Attorney General and the Director of Public Prosecutions.  What was agreed on foot of the advice of the Attorney General was that the recommendations in the report would be published in full, and that was done on 3 December. Implementation of these recommendations falls to a number of Departments and agencies. They cover several areas, for example, tracking pupil movement between primary schools, including cross-border movement; a review of GDPR and network checking; guidance to social workers; the development of procedures for waiting list management; the development of a framework for quality assurance monitoring and review; outcome measurement for family support provider agencies; and a review of the Tusla–An Garda Síochána protocol.  The Attorney General recommended that the full NRP report be shared with the Minister for Education and Youth, Deputy Naughton. It has been shared with her. The Department is engaging with the relevant Departments and agencies, including Tusla, on the implementation of the recommendations relevant to them. Tusla has already commenced the process of implementing the recommendations under its remit. I am clear that the implementation of the recommendations should be completed as soon as possible.  I have recently introduced a Bill updating and modernising the Child Care Act, which provides the foundation for child protection and welfare services in the State. This will strengthen the child protection legal framework and the powers available to Tusla. Key child protection features include the introduction of a duty to co-operate among bodies. \n Deputy Ruairí Ó Murchú  The Minister will have an opportunity to follow on regarding what she envisages changing legislatively. Her comments recognise the need to update legislation and ensure a framework for child protection. Our thoughts are on Kyran Durnin and the other tragic cases I have mentioned. We need to put whatever protections we can in place.  I ask that the Minister engage with Tusla and other agencies to ensure the recommendations will be acted on. Could she give a timeline on the other reports and recommendations arising from them regarding the cases of Vadym Davydenko, Daniel Aruebose and the ten-year-old girl who was assaulted while in the care of the State? It is vital that we do all and sundry, that due diligence be done and that we have a framework that works. Tusla is not sufficiently resourced in respect of staffing and other areas. There are attempts to rectify this. How are they going? \n Deputy Norma Foley  The Deputy alluded to some of the new measures we will be introducing under amendments to the Child Care Act. A duty to co-operate will be introduced. This is important and it will mean there will be a compelling duty on all relevant bodies dealing with children, including Tusla and Departments, to co-operate proactively in performing their existing functions relevant to the development, welfare and protection of children.  With the new duty to co-operate, there will be a clear basis for the sharing of information between agencies and organisations when working together on child protection and child welfare matters. I am referring to the sharing of information around the table in the best interest of children so as to protect them.  I will also be introducing amendments to the Child Care Act to place the NRP on a statutory footing. The Deputy and so many others were keen for us to do this. This measure will further enhance the work of the NRP in addition to strengthening its independence and ability to compel information and witnesses in respect of all reviews it undertakes. I acknowledge the work of the NRP. \n Deputy Ruairí Ó Murchú  What the Minister referred to is vital whether we are talking about putting the NRP on a statutory footing or following through on all the recommendations. Could I have a notion of what the general timeline is? I understand that due diligence had to be done on the legislative process.  The issues around the tracking of pupils, particularly whatever cross-border directive is needed, should be addressed straight away. We should be overcoming whatever issues there are with GDPR. I would also like an update on the Tusla-Garda protocol.  Kate Duggan and others spoke about the increase in complex cases, the new model of care Tusla is looking to bring in and the need for it to increase its staff. We frequently hear from those in the community and voluntary sector who get referrals from Tusla. They also speak about their need for increased resourcing to ensure we have something that is more fit for purpose for looking after children and particularly the most vulnerable. \n Deputy Norma Foley  I acknowledge that those in Tusla, the Department and all the agencies who work with children are absolutely central to protecting vulnerable children and are doing excellent work individually. However, the purpose of the duty to co-operate is that collectively there will be the sharing of information the Deputy referenced, everybody will be around the one table as it were and there will be a strong sense of partnership across State agencies to ensure that everyone is fully engaged with and aware of the role they play in protecting children from harm.  The Deputy specifically referenced North-South co-operation. Although it is a matter for the Department of Education and Youth, I am aware of very extensive North-South engagement on that. It is an issue I have discussed with the North's Minister for Education, Paul Givan, on a number of occasions and the work there is very advanced. All the recommendations that have been outlined have been shared with each of the Departments and agencies concerned. It is a matter of priority for them to be put in place. As I said, the work with Tusla is under way. A considerable uplift in the funding of €1.37 billion has been provided for Tusla in the budget this year, and significant work is under way on recruitment of staff. \n Deputy Ruairí Ó Murchú  I ask the Minister to come back to me on a timeline for the report.

        "answerText": " Deputy Ruairí Ó Murchú  What engagement has there been with the Department of Education and Youth? There are proposals around the autism protocol. We spoke earlier about the very specific proposal to remove the requirement for an assessment of need in order for a child to find an appropriate school place, whether that is in a special class, in a mainstream setting with supports or in a special school. There has been huge unease among the teaching unions and others in relation to who will make this assessment. It is very important that we bring clarity to this particular case. We all want to see streamlining of the assessment of need process. I have always said I have no particular issue with that, but clarity is needed at this time. \n Deputy Emer Higgins  The Government absolutely recognises there are unacceptable delays in accessing assessments of need. My Department and the HSE are committed to addressing these delays. Under the Disability Act, an assessment of need is an assessment process carried out by the HSE where a person is of the opinion that he or she may have a disability for anyone born after 1 June 2002. It first establishes whether the person has a disability as defined within the Act and then identifies the health and education needs of the person with the disability and the service required to meet those needs.  As the Deputy said, last week the Government announced a series of reforms to the assessment of need process which will make the process more effective and efficient for children and families, and will move towards more assessments being delivered within the six-month statutory timeframe. These reforms include changes to Part 2 of the Disability Act, which provides for assessments of need. The general scheme of the disability (amendment) Bill 2025 was approved by the Government on 9 December and will be published on the Department’s website shortly. It is important to say these changes will not remove any rights for parents to apply for an assessment of need for their child, nor will they alter the statutory six-month timeline set out in the Disability Act.  Turning to access to treatment and therapies, I must emphasise that children do not require an assessment of need to access health services including primary care, children’s disability network teams, CDNTs, or mental health services. However, it is recognised that there can be delays for children and families in getting access to the treatments and therapies they need.  Children can be on a number of different waiting lists which can cause confusion for families. In 2026 the HSE will introduce a single point of access system, which will make it easier for families to be referred to the right service whether that is a CDNT, primary care, or a child and adolescent mental health team.  The recruitment of staff across the disability sector continues to be a key priority in ensuring children can access therapies in a timely manner. An intensive focus of my Department has been on increasing the staffing of CDNTs that deliver supports and services to children with complex needs. My Department has been in discussions with the Department of education on the need to phase out the requirement for an assessment of need to access special education class or school. \n Deputy Ruairí Ó Murchú  Will the Minister of State give some detail on what that engagement has been? I get that it is the early stages but unfortunately it has led to some unease. We all accept there are huge issues in relation to those who have been on the assessment of need waiting list. None of it has been great for the families and children. People are looking for adequate and correct therapies and supports. I have heard many times that the Department does not require an assessment of need to deliver supports and therapies, but unfortunately parents operate in a slightly different world and at this time the schools require assessments of need. While that is being dealt with, we need clarity. As I said, I have no particular issue if we are accepting that 45% of those who go through assessments of need have autism and if we can find the means whereby people can get a proper assessment in relation to autism and then can get the therapies. However, I ask again about recruitment as we try to recruit to the CDNTs and directly to schools and these new teams. Can the Minister of State go into the detail of how things will change in these things given the huge amount of work and the huge cohort they have to deal with? \n Deputy Emer Higgins  That statistic that 45% of children who go through the assessment of need process receive a diagnosis of autism is absolutely correct. For that reason the HSE is standing up a new autism assessment and protocol process in order to be able to respond to emerging need in this area. We hope that from January, but definitely from the first quarter of next year, children who are displaying autistic traits will be referred into the new HSE autism protocol and assessment process. That will absolutely help. It will provide them with specific interventions that will be most appropriate to them. That is a really welcome development. I thank the HSE for its hard work and its engagement with my Department on this.  Part of what was announced last week was a six-pronged approach. We have the heads of the Bill. Decisions are being communicated earlier to parents. There is a single point of access. There is the autism protocol and assessment. We also have recruitment in our own CDNTs. We are recruiting at the moment and will be recruiting another 150 staff next year. Throughout the disability service we will recruit 1,000 people next year and we are also outsourcing assessments of need. Education is the other element of that. The Minister for education will come back to the Cabinet committee on disability in the first quarter of next year with formulated proposals on that issue. \n Deputy Ruairí Ó Murchú  If we are talking about the first quarter for the education piece, it could be as far away as March before we have clarity on it. It needs to happen as soon as possible.  When will we see delivery on the single point of access? I think Bernard Gloster said that those who have the best things to say about the CDNTs are those who have a contact person they can engage with because then they know the ins and outs. That is where some of this falls apart. Sometimes there needs to be a straight conversation about supports and about the future trajectory for children and parents. When that is lacking, obviously it does not work.  The Minister of State is saying that in January or at least some point in the first quarter of next year, the autism protocol will operate. As that waiting list becomes populated, will we have capacity to deliver on it?  Will the new teams ensure there is a greater level of communication? As I have said before, I am worried about recruiting to all the bodies need to recruit to. Will they be able to deal with the huge cohort that are on the waiting list now and the parents who have suffered because they did not have the supports they should have? \n An Leas-Cheann Comhairle  A short response from the Minister of State. \n Deputy Emer Higgins  Taking cognisance of the Chair I will give a short response. Our in-reach teams will support the HSE's new model and will work to ensure there is more joined-up thinking between primary care, CAMHS and our CDNTs. Each team will consist of a psychologist, a speech and language therapist, an occupational therapist and an administration person. Part of the reason we have an administration person is because some of the feedback we have received from parents is around communication. This person will assist with that from a caseload management perspective. We will be standing up 11 teams in 2026 and a further nine teams in 2027. That will be 20 teams, which will be one team per regional health organisation. \n An Leas-Cheann Comhairle  I thank the Minister of State. That concludes questions to the Minister for Children, Disability and Equality. \n Minister for Children, Disability and Equality (Deputy Norma Foley)  Happy Christmas from all of us. Thank you for everything. \n An Leas-Cheann Comhairle  I wish the Minister and the Minister of State and their officials a happy Christmas. ",

        "answerText": " Minister for Climate, Energy and the Environment  Responsibility for the regulation of the electricity market is a matter for the Commission for Regulation of Utilities (CRU) which is an independent regulator, accountable to the Oireachtas and not the Minister. The CRU was assigned responsibility for the regulation of the Irish electricity sector following the enactment of the Electricity Regulation Act, 1999 and subsequent legislation.  Price setting by electricity suppliers, including standing charges, is a commercial and operational matter for the companies concerned. Each such company has its own different approach to pricing decisions over time, in accordance with factors such as their overall company strategic direction and developments in their cost base. Within a competitive environment, providers also have costs such as staffing, tax, infrastructure, and cost of network tariffs which in turn affects end users’ bills.  As Minister, I meet with a range of stakeholders on important topics, including energy prices, on a regular basis. On 26 September 2025, I met with the four biggest energy suppliers in Ireland in relation to announcements on price increases and supports for households this Winter. My officials also meet with suppliers and the CRU on a regular basis. While price setting is ultimately a matter for the suppliers themselves, a key message to them is the critical importance of prices being reduced as soon as possible.  My Department has established a cross-Government National Energy Affordability Taskforce to identify, assess and implement measures that will enhance energy affordability for households and businesses, while delivering key renewable commitments and protecting security of supply and economic stability.  The taskforce's first report set out measures for consideration as part of the Budget 2026 process. This report has been published on Gov.ie, in advance of further analysis and the publication of the Energy Affordability Action Plan in 2026. ",

The credit may also be available to an individual who has custody of, and maintains at his or her own expense, a child who fulfils the above criteria.  I am advised by Revenue that the latest data available on the number of taxpayer units availing of the ICTC is available on the Revenue website in their ‘Cost of Tax Expenditures’ publication, which can be accessed at: www.revenue.ie/en/corporate/documents/statistics/tax-expenditures/costs-tax-expenditures.pdf  In this regard, 47,700 taxpayer units claimed the credit, with an Exchequer cost of €151.3 million, in 2023 the latest year for which Revenue data is available.  As self-assessed Form 11 tax returns for 2024 were due to be filed by November 2025, data is not yet available in relation to that year. Data in relation to 2024 will be available in mid-2026, once the returns have been processed and data is prepared for analysis. The deadline for self-assessed Form 11 returns in relation to 2025 are not due until November 2026 and therefore data in relation to 2025 will be available in mid-2027.  It should be noted that the data published in relation to the ICTC are published on a taxpayer unit basis, where jointly assessed couples are counted as one unit. ",

        "answerText": " Minister for Children, Disability and Equality  The Government recognises that there are unacceptable delays in accessing Assessments of Need. The Department and the HSE are committed to addressing these delays.  It is important to note that children do not require an Assessment of Need to access health services, including Primary Care, Children’s Disability Network Teams or Mental Health Services. However, the number of Assessment of Need applications has increased significantly in recent years, with applications this year expected to be in excess of 11,000 compared to 4,700 in 2020.  There has been a noted improvement in the number of completed applications in recent years with over 4,100 completed in 2024, an increase of 30% compared to 2023. This trend is continuing this year, with a 57% increase in completed assessments in the first nine months of the year compared to the same period in 2024.  This improvement has been achieved by a number of measures, including the Assessment of Need Targeted Waitlist Initiative which focuses on those families waiting longest for Assessments of Need. Under this Initiative, the HSE procures clinical assessments from approved private providers. Over 6,300 clinical assessments have been commissioned from private providers since the Initiative started in June 2024. Budget 2026 provides for the continuation of this Initiative next year with €20 million provided for the delivery of some 6,000 clinical assessments.  Despite this, the number of applications overdue for completion has grown and the HSE has estimated that over 22,000 applications will be overdue by the end of 2025.  On December 9th, Government announced a series of reforms to the Assessment of Need process which will make the process more effective and efficient for children and families and move towards more assessments being delivered within the statutory 6-month timeframe.  These reforms will include legislative changes to Part 2 of the Disability Act 2005, which addresses Assessment of Need. These changes will not remove any rights for parents to apply for an Assessment of Need for their child, nor will they alter the statutory six-month timeline set out in the Disability Act.  The Department is working with the HSE to identify further opportunities to enhance processes, improve training, and increase administrative supports for HSE Assessment Officers who are responsible for the production of assessment reports. This includes the establishment of working groups to address learning and development needs and to develop statutory guidelines.  The provision of an effective and efficient Assessment of Need system continues to be a priority for the Government. ",

        "answerText": " The Taoiseach  I propose to take Questions Nos. 1 to 15, inclusive, together.  The Cabinet committee on housing last met yesterday, Monday, 15 December. The committee works to ensure a cross-Government approach to the implementation of our commitments regarding housing policy. This week’s meeting was specifically focused on our homelessness challenge, in particular the national housing plan commitments in this regard, including the development of a homeless prevention framework and a child and family homelessness action plan.  We are making good progress on the delivery of homes to those most in need across the country, with the new housing plan committed to delivering 72,000 social homes over its lifetime. However, as we increase supply, we also recognise that those experiencing, or at risk of, homelessness have a wide and complex variety of needs. We need to ensure that the appropriate services and policies are in place to support them. Housing is our single biggest issue as a country, with profound social and economic consequences. That is why it is at the centre of the Government’s focus.  Along with the largest ever commitment on social housing, the new national housing plan commits to delivering 300,000 new homes, including 90,000 affordable supports to help people who are struggling to have a home of their own. The plan sets out the highest ever commitment of State funding for housing, with €28 billion over the next five years, coupled with additional funding through State vehicles, including the Land Development Agency, the Housing Finance Agency, Home Building Finance Ireland, the First Home Scheme and the Irish Strategic Investment Fund. Housing delivery, along with infrastructure and utility investment to enable delivery at scale, is at the core of the agreed national development plan published in July, and, at €275 billion, the largest ever capital injection in the history of the State.  To build homes at the scale now required, we need improved and more resilient water, energy and transport services. We will see large-scale investment in all of these areas over the coming years. Last month under price review 6, the investment plan for energy infrastructure was finalised, including funding allocations of up to €18 billion to ESB and EirGrid, leveraged by the Government injection of €3.5 billion in equity to these companies. This will enable thousands more homes to be connected to the grid.  We have also published the investment plan for water, which sets out over €12 billion investment in our water infrastructure, the majority of which will support the delivery of our housing targets. In addition, we are tackling barriers to delivery, through the accelerating infrastructure report and action plan, which includes reforms which will support public and private sector delivery of homes at scale.  Housing is at the centre of the State’s investment and focus for the coming years. However, to meet our targets, we will also need significant delivery from the private sector and we have implemented a number of measures and reforms in support of this. We have focused on making apartment delivery more financially viable, reformed our planning process and created a stable policy environment to enable the private sector to deliver at scale.  We are seeing indications now that our measures are beginning to take effect, evidenced by CSO data showing that we have had an increase of almost 30% in homes approved for planning in quarter 3 of this year, in comparison with the same time period last year, with the number of apartments approved up by over 50%. These are clear indications of confidence. Work is under way to zone a significantly higher quantum of land across the country. Now is the time for ambitious execution, and we have set out a clear framework and roadmap for the coming years to do this. I am confident that we can build on our success to date and bring about a very significant scale-up in our delivery of housing over the lifetime of this Government. \n Deputy Séamus McGrath  I thank the Taoiseach. I welcome today's announcement in relation to the vacant property refurbishment grant and the extension of this grant until 2030. This provides important certainty from a policy point of view in relation to vacant properties. We know they are still a very significant challenge. I also welcome the new initiative in relation to the above the shop grant. Up to €140,000, where multiple properties are involved, is potentially available. That is very significant and the fact that it will be available by quarter 1 of the new year is very important. It is important to look at the local authorities and their resourcing in terms of being able to deal with this grant. I ask the Taoiseach to also look at that. We want these grants to be processed in a timely manner so that we can get on with utilising this currently under-occupied space. The resourcing of local authorities is important and I ask the Taoiseach to look at that. \n Deputy Paul McAuliffe  In my constituency between Shanowen Road and Collins Avenue there are proposals to build new apartment developments. While the additional new housing is incredibly welcome, unfortunately the under-utilised industrial estate there is currently occupied by Santry Boxing Club. Would the Taoiseach agree as well as powering ahead with the provision of new housing, Dublin City Council needs to have a more proactive strategy of making land available to sports clubs so they can avail of programmes like the sports capital grant? Santry Boxing Club is an amazing local facility and will be a great facility for those new homes that will be built. As well as enabling new homes, we need to put in place new facilities, and Dublin City Council needs to be more proactive in making land available to sports clubs. \n Deputy Shane Moynihan  As the Taoiseach said, the delivery of housing is the number one priority for this Government. That is why it is strategically important that all sectors of the Government support that aim, namely through the national development plan's transport sectoral plan, which was published recently. In my constituency, which the Taoiseach visited, we see it as one of the fastest-growing constituencies in the country, with large developments like Adamstown and Clonburris flying ahead. In its county development plans, South Dublin County Council is setting very ambitious targets for zoning. The key to enabling this zoning and to enabling delivery of those homes is the deployment and development of DART+ South West as a transport programme, to intensify the capacity on that line, not only benefitting commuters in Dublin Mid-West but also Kildare North, Dublin South-Central and Dublin-Central.  I am asking the Taoiseach for his support to do all we can to prioritise and bring forward, where possible, the delivery of Dart+ South West as a long overdue infrastructure requirement to not only allow catch-up on public transport in my area but also to plan for the future. \n Deputy John Connolly  One of the actions in the recently published housing plan is that the Department will be publishing quarterly and annual performance tables for new-build output versus targets per local authority, thereby ensuring transparency and accountability.  I understand that will commence next June in relation to social housing. We should also provide similar tables in relation to affordable housing. The local authorities should also be assessed on their output of affordable housing. What actions will the Government take with local authorities that are not meeting their housing targets? \n Deputy Ryan O'Meara  Last February the Government announced its intention to remove the requirement for planning permission for log cabins and modular homes in backyard developments. By the end of the Christmas recess, it will be nearly a year since we heard that announcement. One-off houses in rural Ireland can benefit if we allow log cabins and modular homes to be built not just in backyard developments. They are also one of the few affordable houses out there for young people in rural Ireland whom I speak to. I could give numerous examples of log cabins and modular homes across north Tipperary and north-west Kilkenny that are at threat of enforcement proceedings because they do not have planning permission. Enforcement should not be ongoing until we know what these regulations say. In addition, the development contributions for one-off rural houses should be scrapped again. They are simply a privilege for building on your own land. First, will we see these planning regulations that will exempt log cabins? Second, will this go beyond backyard developments and allow them in rural areas? Third, when will we see the regulations? \n An Ceann Comhairle  I call Deputy Ruth Coppinger. One question. \n Deputy Ruth Coppinger  I also send my solidarity to the Jewish community in Sydney following the appalling attack.  I am sure the Taoiseach agrees with me that cities should be liveable and should have culture as well as venues where people can meet, socialise and enjoy themselves. Will the Cabinet committee on housing and local government discuss the issue of The Complex, a very important cultural space in our capital where artists are currently housed but have been given an eviction notice for the middle of January? A protest on this will come to the Dáil tomorrow. I have attended meetings and other get-togethers in The Complex. In fact, it was the venue for the launch of one of the presidential campaigns. Dublin City Council is open to buying The Complex but only if it can be given 80% to 90% of the funding. We need to intervene to buy this for €10 million. It would be €80 million to buy or to build a similar space. \n Deputy Rose Conway-Walsh  I ask the Taoiseach to consider issuing an upfront fund to local authorities, but to Mayo County Council in particular, in order that they can turn around the vacant properties they have without having to go through the bureaucratic nightmare of applying for funding from central government on a house-by-house, unit-by-unit basis. Can the Taoiseach imagine what it is like to be a homeless person in Mayo watching council houses remain empty month after month while nothing is done? I will give him an example from a young mother in my constituency:  I am homeless, living in a friend's house. I've just had my first baby. She's now a month old. She was born at 36 weeks. I've been in and out of hospital the whole of the pregnancy with stress and anxiety. I developed diabetes also. I was rushed to a Dublin hospital for a week from bleeding and pains. I had a terrible experience. A lot of this stress has been brought on because of my homeless situation.  That is the case for many people. \n Deputy Barry Heneghan  I too join in the condolences on the attack that happened on the Jewish community in Australia.  I also support the plea for funding for The Complex.  Regarding the Cabinet committee on housing, across the country AHBs have signed turnkey deals that then collapse. In Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown, there was a recent scheme that had the contract signed, everything was above board, they were all ready and, at the last minute, when they were looking for funding, the Department denied the funding for 40 turnkey units. If we are to bring medium-sized and small developers into the market, this risk cannot be acceptable. We will not get the funding from the funding schemes, and it is putting all the risk on the developers. The homes are built, the deal collapses and the investor walks away. We want these small-scale developers to meet the housing targets. I have hundreds of people in my constituency looking for affordable housing, and this cannot happen. \n Deputy Darren O'Rourke  I want to raise the issue of child homelessness. In October there were 5,274 children in emergency accommodation. More than 150 of those were in my county, Meath. There is an expectation that at Christmas there will be more than 5,000 and that almost 1,000 of those will be in emergency accommodation for their second or third Christmas. Are there specific measures the Government will take in advance of Christmas, now a handful of days away, to minimise the number of children in homelessness this Christmas? \n Deputy Ruairí Ó Murchú  We all know the issue that exists in relation to housing, whether it is homelessness, the lack of supply, those who cannot get houses, whether from a rental point of view or a purchase point of view, and those languishing on social housing lists. However, we also have to look at the issue of estate management. I do not believe the local authorities, like Louth County Council, have the necessary powers when dealing with chaotic tenants. They may need supports, but even beyond that, we have seen outright criminality and drug-dealing. We know that AHBs have greater levels of power even in relation to the nuclear action of eviction. That should be the last thing that is looked at but, at the end of the day, it is a requirement. I have worked alongside the Louth local authority, the Garda and others in dealing with some situations and we have attempted to move people sideways to deal with the issue. Some very good work has been done, but we do not have the necessary tools, and that is the problem. \n Deputy Liam Quaide  One of the most infuriating parts of the housing crisis is the tens of thousands of properties that have been left idle and decaying throughout the country. Youghal's potential to be on a par with Kinsale for economic prosperity and tourism has been thwarted by the epic scale of dereliction that has been allowed to take place there over many years. Likewise, Castlemartyr and Midleton have many prime-location properties left like deserted husks where boutiques could be flourishing or community hubs or accommodation created. In Holland or Germany this would not be tolerated. Landlords would have to sell up or repurpose a vacant property within a reasonable period or face losing it. The Government's softly-softly approach to vacancy and dereliction is clearly not working, and our towns and villages are haunted by this policy failure. We need to see swift direct action by our local authorities with landlords who blight our streets with decaying properties and a much more urgent pursuit of derelict site levies. The collection of derelict site levies by Revenue is welcome, but why is the Government waiting until 2027 to implement this? \n Deputy Peadar Tóibín  The housing crisis has had varied and wide ramifications in Irish society. One of them is a serious fall in the fertility rate in this State. There has been a 30% fall in the number of births annually. There has been a 20,000 fall in the number of births annually since Celtic tiger times. Some 69% of people aged 25 years or under are living with their parents. Well over 40% of adults who are under 30 are living with their parents. That is changing the very nature of Irish society. The ability for adults to form relationships to have children is being deleted for hundreds of thousands of people. This is having massive ramifications. Schools are now noticing that there is a fall in the number of children being enrolled. An unbalanced demographic structure has serious consequences for our workforce and our pensions. Planning, permitting, licensing, tendering and judicial reviews here are among the slowest in the whole of the European Union. While the Taoiseach's Government has announced plans, they are not ambitious enough and I do not believe they will be implemented in a timely fashion. \n The Taoiseach  There were quite a number of questions there, beginning with Deputy Séamus McGrath. I welcome also the good initiative we have announced today, namely the extension of the vacant refurbishment grant to 2030, but specifically on the commercial properties and the €140,000 plus a €5,000 grant for assistance to support the owner to design a project. The Deputy is right in saying that we need to make sure that the local authorities prioritise this - in other words, that they put a project manager or whatever in charge of this operation in the towns and the cities to make this a reality. It needs to be driven with someone who is accountable and who is doing this every single day, in my view. I will talk to the Minister about that.  We need to alert all the business committees in towns and cities because people need to know. If you combine it with the living city initiative, there are real prospects of, once and for all, getting activity in towns and city centres to address dereliction and allow for change of use. Due to changing patterns of trade and so on, many commercial uses are no longer sustainable, so there is an opportunity for increased numbers residential units in towns and cities.  Deputy McAuliffe raised the topic of the Santry Boxing Club. I was recently with the Land Development Agency, LDA, on the southside, where an existing boxing club has been incorporated into a housing development. A new boxing club is being built in the housing development. That is the way to go. Is the local authority involved in the specific development to which the Deputy referred? It is. The local authority should look seriously at that example. Amenities matter in communities and society. They give young people opportunities. It seems to me that some accommodation must be made for Santry Boxing Club. The other example was a good initiative. The name of the boxing club escapes me now, but the people will have a first-class boxing club as a result of the development. It might be a bigger development. In fairness to the LDA, it saw that needed to be done. The Deputy might give me the details.  Deputy Shane Moynihan spoke about the interdependence of the national transport plan in terms of infrastructure and housing delivery. Housing delivery will depend on infrastructure delivery. I am acutely aware of planning considerations. South Dublin County Council is looking at 10,000 to 18,000 new zonings for housing. That will be dependent on DART+ South West. I have had meetings with the Minister for public expenditure and the Minister for climate and transport, Deputy Darragh O'Brien, to ensure we can underpin the development of DART+ South West. We can make progress on that to give the certainty that the council, Deputy Moynihan and the people in the area require.  Deputy Connolly asked about quarterly tables for social housing. He asked about applying such an approach to affordable housing. I will talk to the Minister. It is a fair point. The councils control a bit more for social housing, but outputs should be across the board. The first issue is to highlight those councils that are not performing. It becomes fairly obvious in a league table scenario which councils are not performing. The actions can take a number of forms. We have to work through the actions. There could be disincentives or limited finance. We have to work through that, but there must be consequences or direct action from the State to override councils that are not performing in respect of housing more generally.  Deputy O'Meara spoke about log cabins and modular homes. I hope that the Minister will in February have a list of exempted developments. I understand it has expanded significantly. There have been a lot of submissions from Government Departments and agencies, particularly those with acute issues, including health, for example, where we need urgent public services. The Minister recently indicated to me that it would be February that we will have completion of that. It is fairly complex and much bigger than we originally anticipated.  The rural housing guidelines need to be published. I have asked the Minister to prioritise that. I fully accept what the Deputy is saying about the potential for enabling and helping young people in rural Ireland to afford housing at a reasonable cost when it comes to buying or renting. We will keep an eye on that. We will look at the development levies over time in respect of rural buildings on people's land although services of one kind or another are required.  I fundamentally agree with Deputy Coppinger that cities should be liveable and that there should be strong social support and creative cultural amenities. The Deputy said the local authority is depending on someone else. Other local authorities tend to get on with it and are in a position to facilitate either the acquisition or purchase of a building without having to do the simple equation and getting the Department to pay out for every single acquisition. The Minister for public expenditure has taken an interest in this issue. I will check the current lie of the land in respect of the Complex. I know Deputy Heneghan also raised that issue.  To Deputy Conway-Walsh, I say that there is no reason why voids should take so long. There has to be some framework of control for the Department. We discovered recently with the tenant in situ scheme that houses were being bought with people living in them. Those houses are bought by councils and suddenly there is €80,000 or €100,000 going into the house. The original objective of that was to stop people going into homelessness. When a local authority house becomes vacant, unless there is something majorly wrong structurally, it should be occupied within a month. We have given huge money to local authorities for voids over the past five years. They should get on with it. They let the houses lie idle for too long. It is inexcusable. In some councils, there is inertia. I have seen it. People leave very good houses for one reason or another, the shutters go up and the houses are left there for three or four months. Those houses should be reoccupied once the electrics and everything else are grand. If we have to get around to repairing them, we can at least give someone the house. That is my view. I get impatient about it from time to time, to be honest. I hear what the Deputy is saying. If you give an upfront grant, there is no guarantee it will be spent on voids, and that is the problem.  I do not have the details of the 40-turnkey units to which Deputy Heneghan referred. Are they in Dún Laoghaire? \n Deputy Barry Heneghan  Yes. \n The Taoiseach  Has the Deputy moved across? \n Deputy Barry Heneghan  I am national now. \n The Taoiseach  The Deputy has a wide compass. He is national now. I ask him to give me the details and I will follow through. It should not happen. I do not know the background to that.  I appreciate the Deputy's comments about the Jewish community in Ireland and the impact that what happened in Bondi Beach has had on the Jewish community globally and in Ireland. The murder that took place was quite shocking. Others were injured. The Deputy also referenced the Complex.  Deputy O'Rourke spoke about child homelessness. The meeting of the Cabinet subcommittee on housing yesterday was entirely about different aspects of homelessness. We had good presentation of data. The data illustrates that there is a wide variety of reason why people become homeless. There are different factors. There is a high rate for singles in homelessness as well as children. There are different elements to the issue. An increasing amount of those who leave direct provision end up homeless. Family reunification comes with that. The link between migration and housing has grown, but is not the only factor. Family separation is a factor. Different factors give rise to homelessness, and specifically child homelessness. The Minister has specific measures. He achieved €100 million in the budget to acquire social housing and housing more generally to take more families out of emergency accommodation and get them into either local authority houses or acquired homes. There is a specific programme ahead now.  Have I dealt with everyone? I have not. \n An Ceann Comhairle  Deputies Ó Murchú and Tóibín. \n The Taoiseach  How could I forget Deputy Ó Murchú? He spoke about estate management powers to deal with what he described as \"chaotic tenants\". There are powers. I am not sure that the AHBs have different powers. They just have a different way of operating. \n Deputy Ruairí Ó Murchú  It is about eviction. \n The Taoiseach  They have a different of operating. They lay it down from the beginning. \n Deputy Ruairí Ó Murchú  It is easier for them to evict people. \n The Taoiseach  Local authorities have struggled with this for quite a long time. My own belief is that persistent misbehaviour and so on should mean you lose the tenancy. That is what should happen. It is hard. We know of housing estates that have awful tensions, difficulties and challenges. I would be glad to work with the Deputy on the issue. I will talk to the Minister about it.  Deputy Quaide spoke about the thousands of houses that have been left lying idle. We give responsibilities to the local authorities. Deputy Connolly talked about league tables. There is a league table showing which local authorities did what in respect of derelict sites. It is very telling. There are two or three that did an exceptional job. If they can do it, why cannot others? It begs the question of whether there is, or has been historically, inertia in local authorities about the Derelict Sites Act. Revenue will now be charged with it. That will bring about a change and better behaviour. The reason for the length of time, and I hope it can be accelerated, is the mapping. I have challenged officials from the Department of Finance and Revenue about this issue. I have asked why the maps are not there already and why they would take so long. Apparently, at the time of the land tax and others, the mapping was not as comprehensive as people would have expected.  That is the issue there. I think it is a game-changer and will be a game-changer.  Deputy Tóibín is making a link between falling fertility and the housing issue. Again, there are a number of variables, I imagine, responsible for that. The bottom line is we do need to provide more housing more quickly to as many young people as possible. It is a social need. Every young person in the country has a right to aspire to owning a home, and many do aspire to owning a home, or some young families being able to rent a home at an affordable cost. We are building substantially more houses than we did five years ago. We are doing about 30,000 odd now compared to 20,000 in 2020. We need to go to 50,000 and we need all hands on deck in that respect. I do not think enrolments are going down in schools yet, I think they are going up. \n Deputy Peadar Tóibín  They are; 30 schools are falling this year. And childcare. ",

I will allow a one-one-one exchange. \n Deputy Ruairí Ó Murchú  My question relates to the investigations into the tragedy of the loss of Private Seán Rooney, who was killed on 14 December 2022 while on active service in Lebanon. Trooper Shane Kearney and a number of others were injured in the incident. This shows us the reality of peacekeeping. It is absolutely vital that we engage with the Lebanese authorities on this matter. None of us could be happy with the lenient sentences for those responsible. I understand Mohammad Ayyad is still free. We must ensure the Lebanese authorities follow through on their promise of appealing the overly lenient sentences. We also must see publication of the investigation by Mr. Michael Delaney SC into operational protocols. \n Deputy Helen McEntee  This is something I raised directly with my Lebanese counterpart, Youssef Rajji, when I met with him yesterday prior to the EU-Lebanon Association Council meeting. I referred to the trauma that has been inflicted on Private Rooney's family, the need for answers and the need to ensure we have the full co-operation and support of the Lebanese Government regarding the appeal. We will continue to engage with the Lebanese authorities in that regard. It is absolutely essential that we have answers and an appropriate response to what has happened to date. I have written to Private Rooney's mother and I hope to meet with his family in the new year and engage directly with them on this matter. \n Deputy Ruairí Ó Murchú  I really appreciate the Minister's answer. It is absolutely vital that we follow through on the promise that was made that no stone will be left unturned in delivering justice for Private Seán Rooney. It is essential that we look after the families of those who have made the ultimate sacrifice.  I understand the Tánaiste briefed the Minister on the issue, of which she may already have been aware, regarding John McNeela and the non-transfer of a pension to him on the death of his wife. His son Michael McNeela died in Lebanon while on peacekeeping duty. The Army Pensions Act is really unfair legislation that needs to be updated. I understand the Minister's Secretary General is looking at progressing legislation on the back of other legislation. Is there a timeline for that? I have asked previously whether an interim solution is possible and I have spoken about the need to ensure any provision is retrospective. It is vital the change happens as fast as possible. \n Deputy Helen McEntee  For those who make the ultimate sacrifice on the missions they are committed to, we must ensure their families are supported. My colleague has given a commitment that no stone will be left unturned in ensuring there is justice and that we have all the answers. I reaffirm that commitment.  I will get back to the Deputy directly on the pension issue. \n Deputy Ruairí Ó Murchú  I ask that the Minister also get back to me on the timeline for the report by Mr. Micheal Delaney SC. It was intended to be published in quarter four of this year, which is now. ",

        "answerText": " Minister for Defence  The Army Pensions Acts 1923-1980 constitutes a military occupational injuries code which operates separately from, but in addition to, the Defence Forces retirement benefit (superannuation) provisions.  The Acts  primarily provide for disability pensions, and other allowances and gratuities, and they further allow for the award of a Dependent’s Allowance to the widow, children and other dependants of any member of the Defence Forces killed in the course of duty.  The issue in the specific case you refer to relates to a request to transfer a dependant’s allowance previously awarded to a dependant (now deceased) to their spouse; it is not related to a refusal of an Army pension.  There is no scope under the existing legislation for a transfer or grant of this particular type of allowance to another person on the death of the original recipient of the allowance; it can only be granted to a specified person for their lifetime.  A comprehensive review of the legislative provisions and the relevant circumstances of this case has been carried out. Following on from recently received legal advice, a potential administrative solution has been identified and pending approval of that, my officials will make direct contact with the person in question. My officials will also update the Deputy directly at that point.  Any amendment to the legislation could have potential implications for Defence Forces’ pensions in the first instance, and for pension schemes across the wider public sector. It is important to highlight that any changes to military pension scheme terms and conditions, including for dependant’s benefits, cannot be made by my Department in isolation and would be subject to consultation with, and the approval of, the Minister for Public Expenditure National Development Plan and Reform. On this basis there are no immediate plans to amend the existing Army Pensions legislation. ",

        "answerText": " Minister of State at the Department of Public Expenditure, Infrastructure, Public Service Reform and Digitalisation  I propose to take Questions Nos. 27 and 37 together.  The Catchment-based Flood Risk Assessment and Management (CFRAM) Programme, the largest study of flood risk ever undertaken by the State, was completed by the Office of Public Works (OPW) in 2018.  In relation to County Louth in 2019, the Bellurgan Flood Relief Scheme was completed and is protecting 35 properties from significant flood risk.  Through the agreed delivery model, and with OPW funding for six staff, Louth County Council is leading the delivery of five flood relief schemes at Dundalk/Blackrock South, Drogheda, Carlingford/Greenore, Baltray and Ardee. The Government has committed funding to support the delivery of flood relief schemes under the National Development Plan.  The Dundalk/Blackrock South scheme is to protect 1,880 properties. Engineering and environmental consultants were appointed in 2020. The design options for this scheme are expected to be presented to the public in Q1 2026 and a preferred option presented in mid-2026. The planning application is expected to be submitted in Q4 2027. The Ramparts and Blackwater Rivers form part of the study area for the Dundalk Flood Relief Scheme. Options to alleviate flooding along these watercourses will be identified as the scheme progresses and the scheme consultants are liaising with relevant stakeholders including Uisce Éireann in relation to wastewater.  The combined Drogheda and Baltray scheme is to protect 425 properties. Engineering and environmental consultants were appointed in September, 2021. The scope of the area for the scheme was recently extended and the consultant had to undertake further modelling work to identify preliminary measures to protect the extended areas. Emerging Options for the scheme will be presented to the public in Q2 2026. The planning application is expected to be submitted in Q2 2027.  Funding of €339,480 for a viable option, identified by Louth County Council, for Ardee to protect some 30 properties, was approved by the OPW in July 2025. These works are being progressed by Louth County Council and they have advised that these works are to be complete by Q4 2026.  Louth County Council and the OPW are reviewing requirements for a brief to procure engineering and environmental consultants for the Carlingford and Greenore scheme.  In April 2025, the OPW approved funding of €27,685 to Louth County Council for works at Brown’s Lane/Newry Street. This work is now complete and will increase water conveyance capacity and reduce surface water flooding at this location. Louth County Council is assessing areas where works could improve the conveyance characteristics of the Carlingford drainage system and intend to make an appropriate application for funding for proposed works to the OPW.  Scheme Viability Reviews have indicated that potentially viable schemes can be achieved for Annagassan and Termonfeckin and will be progressed through the next round of projects under the national programme of flood relief schemes.  Since 2009, funding of some €1.9 million has been approved for Louth County Council under the OPW’s Minor Flood Mitigation Works and Coastal Protection Scheme, for 26 projects. ",

        "answerText": " Minister for Public Expenditure, Infrastructure, Public Service Reform and Digitalisation  The Programme for Government includes a commitment to reviewing the public procurement process to make it more transparent and encourage greater participation from SMEs. Working towards this aim, and to set out the strategic direction of public procurement for the next five years, my Department is developing a first national public procurement strategy.  The strategy has been subject to an extensive consultation process, which has been critical to understanding the primary challenges and opportunities for both public bodies and suppliers. My Department undertook the following as part of the consultation for this strategy:  • A public consultation to ensure that all those with an interest in the future direction of public procurement had an opportunity to inform the new strategy.  • Regional workshops in Dublin, Cork and Athlone, which included public buyers and policy makers from across the public sector, representation from across the broad spectrum of Irish business, representatives from civil society and members of the public.  • A dedicated webinar for suppliers so they could feed into the development of the strategy.  • Bilateral meetings with government Departments and key stakeholders.  My officials are currently drafting the strategy in accordance with the feedback from the extensive consultation. Discussions with colleagues across government and other key stakeholders will be held to agree desired outcomes and actions for inclusion in the strategy.  Once finalised, the strategy will include objectives and cross-departmental actions to support the delivery of strategic, innovative, sustainable and transparent public procurement that promotes competition, more effective and efficient procurement practices and value for money.  The Government is committed to ensuring that projects are delivered in a timely manner and that value for money is always paramount. In July, my Department published new guidance (Circular 18/2025: Value for Money Obligations), which set out the value for money obligations on all civil and public servants. Building on the work undertaken to date, value for money will constitute a key theme permeating the strategy.  I intend on bringing the strategy to Government in Q1 2026. ",

The brief for this major school building project is to provide an 8-classroom school with an additional 4 classroom Special Educational Needs (SEN) base included. The project has been devolved for delivery to Louth County Council.  The project is currently at stage 4 (construction) of the delivery process. The length of time a project takes to deliver depends on several factors, including scale and complexity and is subject to the time it takes to progress through the various design stages, and the statutory approval process.  The Department has been actively engaged with the Design Team and Louth County Council throughout the process and will continue to engage to provide practical advice and assistance on this important project.  The school had previously submitted a request for additional car park spaces which was reviewed by the Department but was not approved. The Design Team are required to construct and progress the project in accordance with the project brief as agreed in the Service Level Agreement and in accordance with any Local Authority planning conditions. The number of car parking spaces currently provided is in line with the approved planning requirements.  Government support for this investment, including by way of supplementary capital funding, has delivered real benefits for school communities. Supplementary capital funding of €210 million approved by Government has brought the total capital allocation for 2025 for my department to €1.6 billion.  In July the Government announced a capital allocation of €7.55 billion for the Department of Education and Youth for the period 2026-2030 under the National Development Plan. As part of this NDP allocation my department will place a strong emphasis on provision for children with special educational needs, with a particular focus on meeting annual school place needs.  In relation to project rollout for Large-Scale projects and Additional School Accommodation scheme projects, the approach will be to continue to maximise the capacity of the existing school estate as much as possible in the first instance and provide necessary additional capacity through targeted and prioritised project rollout over the course of 2026 to 2030 period to meet the most urgent and prioritised needs.  Government departments are currently in the process of publishing their sectoral NDP Implementation Plans. The sectoral plan for the Education and Youth sector will be published next week and the first tranche of projects to progress to construction will be published in January. This NDP Implementation Plan will optimise outputs from the NDP allocations, with a strong focus on maximising existing school capacity, progressing priority projects where local capacity across schools in the area is insufficient, and ensuring delivery that is affordable, offers value for money, and meets functional needs.

        "answerText": " Minister of State at the Department of Education and Youth  The Assessment of Need (AON) process is provided for under the Disability Act 2005 and is under the remit of the Health Service Executive (HSE).  It is important to note that children and young people in mainstream schools do not require an AON or a diagnosis of disability to access mainstream supports from the 15,000 special education teachers in our school system. The Department has removed the need for health-related information to support special education teaching allocation (SET), to transition from a primary to post primary special class, for assistive technology supports and/or for additional SNA requirements.  There has been a very significant growth in demand for special school and special class places in recent years. This has seen an unprecedented rise in the number of children and young people enrolled in special classes and the opening of 16 new special schools.  There is evidence that, in areas where disability services are unable to meet the full range of needs of children and young people, such as for early intervention, therapy supports and/or respite, many families are choosing to apply to all local services, regardless of whether this is the appropriate route for provision for their child. In these circumstances, provision of education services is viewed by some, as being a driver for the AON process with families seeking an AON to secure a diagnosis, which is currently required to access a special school/class placement.  Additionally, while a diagnosis is currently required to access a special class or a special school, this does not have to be linked to an AON  The Department is committed to the progressive realisation of an inclusive education system that embraces and welcomes diversity; one which aligns with the United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (UNCRPD) and with policy advice on inclusive education published by the National Council for Special Education (NCSE).

        "answerText": " Deputy Ruairí Ó Murchú  I ask the Minister to outline all the engagements between his Department, Dundalk IT and Queen's University Belfast. We were all happy to see this recent partnership, which will result in greater provision of undergraduate and postgraduate programmes and the creation of an innovation hub, all of which is very positive. I commend Diarmuid O'Callaghan and his team on their work. We need to ensure this partnership is facilitated and enhanced. \n Deputy James Lawless  I was delighted to recently announce this partnership and my support for it. I brought the proposal to the Government to receive all-of-government support and endorsement for it. It is a very exciting and historic proposal. This will be the first all-island university, which speaks to many of our aspirations about our shared island and all-island dimensions. It is a programme that will enhance both DkIT and Queen's University. The partnership will include an integration of DkIT within the academic framework of Queen's University, ensuring that students studying in Dundalk will graduate with a Queen's University award. It also envisages a joint research and innovation centre on the Dundalk campus, which will be a close collaboration with enterprise and industry as part of a research and industry foundational partnership.  It will further strengthen regional development in the north east and along the Dublin-Belfast corridor. It also places a full university education within reach of students in the north east, perhaps filling a gap that may have existed previously between Dublin and Belfast. With this partnership, university education will be accessible and available to students in Dundalk. Of course, student mobility skills development and shared learning are part of that as well.  It is worth noting that the proposal will see DkIT, while becoming a college of Queen's University, remain an autonomous, self-governing university college and retain its rights. It is part of a new model within the Irish higher education landscape. It is a slightly different model from other technological universities and my expectation is it will require legislation. I hope the Deputy and his party will support that, as I imagine they will, and that others in the House will support it too. There is a very exciting and ambitious timetable for it, which I certainly intend to do my best to work with. \n Deputy Ruairí Ó Murchú  We are all very supportive of this proposal, and why would we not be? Obviously, I want to see Dundalk university college, but the cross-Border aspects are fabulous, as is the research and innovation centre the Minister referred to. This is a world-class institute and a world-class university coming together to produce something better. We will be able to build on the great work done by the regional development centre that has spun out a number of impressive start-ups, some of which are incredibly well-known or world famous. We just need to see more of that.  This project could avail of shared island funding. As the Minister said, the timetable is tight enough, so we need to make sure we can facilitate it. Does the Minister have any idea of when this legislation will need to be delivered? I also think the naming process falls within the Minister's remit. \n Deputy James Lawless  I thank the Deputy for that. Discussions are ongoing and intensifying between the two institutions. My Department and I remain in close contact with both institutions. From the early stages, I indicated my full and strong support and shared ambition to develop and progress this partnership. My understanding is the institutions intend to sign heads of agreement this month. This is happening now; it is not an abstract, down-the-road initiative. I am particularly pleased and supportive of this. I communicated to the colleges that it was my wish that this progress with pace. The engagement will continue into the new year in 2026.  There are a number of toll gates we will go through. I expect to be in a position to bring legislation before the House at that stage. There are some technical details that we need to work through. It is important to restate that DkIT will remain within the existing legal and governance frameworks, remaining an active part of our technological and higher education system. There are some alignments that need to be made there but the proposal is certainly moving in the right direction and going well. \n Deputy Ruairí Ó Murchú  I agree with the Minister. It is about making sure that happens, with the heads of agreement and then beyond that. Subject to all the caveats associated with setting deadlines, Dundalk university college could be up and running in 2026, possibly in September. As I said, it will be signed, sealed and delivered in respect of the relationship. We all welcome the fact that the college will be autonomous, rather than being subsumed into another outfit.  There is a huge body of work to do to achieve alignment. We know the issues, whether at third level or in relation to apprenticeships. Certification and recognition of awards has created a whole pile of issues. We need some sort of means by which we deal with those cross-Border issues. At some point, we have to get down to the real work of building a new Ireland but this is definitely a good start. I call on the shared island unit to do more on that than it is doing at the minute. \n Deputy James Lawless  As I have said previously, the Deputy and I share those aspirations in every sense. The Deputy mentioned the mechanics of how we develop the working patterns between Dundalk IT and Queen's University, and referred more broadly to apprenticeships on the island.  On apprenticeships more broadly, I launched the first-ever all-island apprenticeship, namely, the accounting technician programme, along with the Minister of State, Deputy Harkin. We recently worked with the Minister for the Economy, Caoimhe Archibald MLA, in the Northern Ireland Executive, and I was very pleased to be able to do so. We have had a number of very positive engagements at the North-South Ministerial Council. Not so long ago, I also attended the British-Irish Parliamentary Assembly in Surrey, which I think the Deputy attended as well. We have had some really constructive conversations with stakeholders in the North and the UK on things like UCAS and the CAO, in respect of which there is some alignment, and in terms of A levels versus the leaving certificate and so on. There are a number of differences but I think differences can be overcome, and these are details that we can work through. I would not want that to stop and I know the Deputy is of the same mind. It is very important that we just work out how to make it work, and that we go on to make it work. That will be a good day's work when that happens. ",

        "answerText": " Deputy Ruairí Ó Murchú  The Minister met personal assistants from the likes of Drogheda Institute of Further Education, DIFE, the Ó Fiaich Institute of Further Education and Cavan Institute who do huge work in relation to those with disabilities. Fórsa has a pay claim in with the WRC at the moment. Some issues were resolved but I think the biggest issue was the fact that there was the expectation of a review. We know there was going to be a review specifically of PA services but I think it became subsumed into a wider review of disability services. I ask for an update in that regard. \n Deputy James Lawless  I am familiar with the issue. The Deputy has engaged with me on it on a number of occasions. He and I met a group of personal assistants during the summer. Supporting learners with disabilities is a core priority for my Department.  In the budget just gone I was pleased to be able to invest a further €3 million in support for the fund for students with disabilities as well as an additional €1 million for students with mental health challenges. That was along with many other targeted interventions to help address the cost of college and to support students in the different situations they face.  Last year, my Department hosted a national disability symposium in Dublin, bringing together students, families, educators, disabled persons' organisations and other stakeholders to share their experiences and consider further actions that would be appropriate.  Following that engagement, the Department commenced a project focused on better supporting students with disabilities. This project is to examine transitions into further and higher education, to map out the supports and services available to students with disabilities within the further and higher education systems and to develop new approaches to supporting students as they move into employment following college. The latter is perhaps a gap at the moment. That transition to the workforce is essential. I have met many groups both in my constituency and around the country, and the point is often made to me that, even with the additional supports and pathways through education, the transition to the workforce can be challenging. There is an intention to encompass further supports for people to make that transition. That is very much on my mind and the Department's mind as we role out this plan further.  A key element is to map out and identify the supports required and those that are available for students with disabilities across the education sector. This is the first step to ensure the right resources as regards that mapping exercise to see what is needed, what is there and what is missing. That is a sort of gap analysis that will help to map out where to go to, the next stage. That work is expected to commence in 2026, and it is a very important piece of work. \n Deputy Ruairí Ó Murchú  It is a vital piece of work. It will commence in 2026. I ask the Minister to give me a rough outline as to what he thinks this deadline is. I do not think anybody here would dispute that there has been a need to do this for a long time in relation to further and higher education and to find out how we best suit those with disabilities and ensure we can keep them within the educational process.  I am obviously disappointed - I have told the Minister this before - that the review in relation to personal assistants had not happened previously. That would have facilitated the WRC to look at the contracts and the other issues for the workers. They got a slight pay increase but they need to be on a similar rate, whether it is to an SNA or some other educator, and then there are those rights. They do not have a 52-week contract. At this point they will be looking at going back on a social welfare payment, with all the difficulties that occur in relation to this. We really have to facilitate them around that. I ask the Minister to come back with a timeline and a means by which we deal with this. \n Deputy James Lawless  A couple of items arise there. I know personal assistance for students with disabilities is an area of interest the Deputy has raised here a number of times. National policy on personal assistance is being reviewed by the HSE-led personal assistance review group. My Department is not leading that particular aspect of the review. We are very much engaged with it and remain committed to ensuring that students with disabilities can have full access and participation in further and higher education. It is separate from the demonstration project. It is a separate project also looking at how personal assistance can be best utilised within the system. Personal supports are primarily facilitated through the fund for students with disabilities, which is administered by the Higher Education Authority. I have increased that by 10% this year with the additional €3 million funding I mentioned. Any recommendations that come from that review group that are pertinent to my Department will of course then be actioned.  It is also worth noting that personal assistants provide logistical support to learners with disabilities on PLC courses. As of February of this year, there were approximately 104 PAs employed at the ETBs providing those services. \n Deputy Ruairí Ó Murchú  I ask the Minister to expand on that and this review in relation to PA services. I think the biggest issue, as I said previously, was that the position was that the role of the PAs in supporting disabled students was to be considered as part of an interdepartmental review and no progress could be made until the review had concluded. They were unable to state with any certainty when the review would commence and finish. At this point it could be almost both those projects, but it is a timeline as to when that is dealt with in that we could support those people who are doing vital work in facilitating those with disabilities in the PLC set-up. Again, we need to look at the third level sector across the board. That is vital. I ask the Minister to expand on the project, the review and then the timelines for completion. \n Deputy James Lawless  I will pick up on the WRC claim because the Deputy mentioned that as an item of interest. I think the Deputy is well familiar with it, but the position is that ETBs employ staff in some cases to deliver PA services, and the contractual relationship is between the employee and the ETB. \n Deputy Ruairí Ó Murchú  I understand that. \n Deputy James Lawless  Personal assistants are employed usually under fixed-term contracts and, therefore, do not get paid outside of term time, nor do the public servants under section 19 of the ETB Act.  In early 2024 my officials embarked on a review of the hourly rate of pay of personal assistants employed by ETBs. That followed discussions between a representative group of personal assistants and one of my predecessors. I think the Deputy may have been involved in that at the time. \n Deputy Ruairí Ó Murchú  I was. \n Deputy James Lawless  Subsequent to that, ministerial approval issued to SOLAS to increase the hourly rate of pay by 42%, which is very positive and I am sure was very welcome, bringing the rate up from nearly €15 per hour to €21 per hour, with 8% holiday pay included as well. I know there are other claims before the WRC subsequent to that, but I think it is fair to say that significant progress has been made, notwithstanding those other claims. I do not want to get into commentary on claims that remain before the WRC. ",

        "answerText": " The Taoiseach  I propose to take Questions Nos. 1 to 11, inclusive, together.  The Government is committed to the delivery of a national security strategy and work is ongoing in finalising the strategy, co-ordinated by the national security secretariat in my Department and integrating inputs from a range of relevant stakeholders, including the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, the Department of Defence, the Department of Justice, Home Affairs and Migration, An Garda Síochána, the Defence Forces and the National Cybersecurity Centre.  The programme for Government, securing Ireland's future sets out a number of national security commitments, acknowledging that this is a time of upheaval, in particular geopolitical upheaval, with threats and challenges arising from a rapidly changing global geopolitical landscape. The preparation of a draft strategy covers a broad range of national security issues. There is necessarily a focus on the State’s internal security, including the evolving challenges we face from terrorism and extremism and from cyber threats, and a focus on the need to increase our investment in security and to modernise our legislation in the security field, notably in the investigatory powers available to our services. It will include also the implications of recent security, defence and international developments and their related impacts, notably the deteriorating security situation in Europe given Russia's ongoing war in Ukraine and the growth in cyber and hybrid threats in Europe. It will combine an enhanced maritime domain awareness with a prioritised focus on ensuring protection of critical maritime infrastructure, especially critical undersea infrastructure. The ongoing implementation of the report of the Commission on the Defence Forces and the modernisation of aspects of our defence legislation is also included in the preparations.  The National Cyber Security Centre has been placed under the remit of the Minister for Justice, Home Affairs and Migration. This is an important element of the realignment of our national security infrastructure, and a project has been initiated to establish this new statutory national security authority, led by the Department of Justice, Home Affairs and Migration. Earlier this year, I established the Ministerial Council on National Security, which comprises me as chair, the Tánaiste, the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade and for Defence, and the Minister for Justice, Home Affairs and Migration. The council will ensure that at the highest level there is a structured, ongoing review of our strategic national security interests and systematised monitoring of progress on delivering the Government’s commitments over the coming months, including the finalisation of the draft national security strategy. \n Deputy Tom Brabazon  As the Taoiseach is aware, drone sightings in Dublin Bay during the recent Zelenskyy visit underline and underscore the scale of our vulnerabilities and the urgency and need for preparing a strategic national security package. There are reports that international anti-drone units were deployed to Dublin during the visit to assist the emergency response unit. While we welcome the assistance of other states, we should not have to rely on others for our own defence. We should be self-reliant in the first instance. It should be expected that such activity will continue when Ireland takes over the EU Presidency next year, and a national security strategy would allow us to assess risks facing the State, including emergency aerial and technological threats, and set clear goals to guide Government and law makers. Can the Taoiseach provide an update to the House on the development of Ireland's national security strategy and an update on the drone sightings during the Zelenskyy visit? \n Deputy Albert Dolan  When we are talking about national security, it is vital we also give people confidence at a local level in our local security, particularly with regard to An Garda Síochána. In Galway East we have towns that are booming, thriving and growing such as Gort, Loughrea, Tuam and Athenry. Those towns are all feeding into Galway city. They have seen massive population increases and for those people to feel secure in those towns, we need an increase in our gardaí allocation and our gardaí numbers. More importantly, as the populations continue to grow in these towns, we need gardaí that become community gardaí, that the people know and connect with and can build relationships with into the future. These gardaí will serve the area. Our gardaí on the ground right now are working really hard but they need to be supported to handle the large caseloads right across the country but particularly in Galway East, we need additional gardaí. \n Deputy Paul Murphy  Does the Taoiseach think there is any national security implications for the significant decline in basic civil liberties that is happening in Britain, such as the proscription of organisations of Palestine protestors like Palestine Action, the denial of the right to a jury in the vast majority of trials and what is happening with the Palestine protesters who are charged with nothing more than property damage and who have been held for over a year without trial and without access to bail? The consequence is there are now eight protesters on hunger strike for over 30 days. This is the longest, most significant hunger strike since the H-block hunger strikers. Their demands are minimal, namely, the right to a fair trial, the right to access bail, the right to access medical care in prison and for the ending of the proscription of Palestine Action. There is an almost total media blackout on this in Britain, leading people to suspect there is a so-called D-notice in relation to this. Is the Taoiseach concerned about the decline of civil liberties and the fact that people are forced to go on hunger strike in Britain? \n Deputy Ryan O'Meara  Next year we will hold the Presidency of Europe. During that time, as the Taoiseach is more than aware, our national security will be of paramount importance. Given what has happened with drone activity and interference in Denmark, there is a fear the same will happen in Ireland. With President Zelenskyy's visit last week, we saw drones off the coast of Dublin. It is one thing for us to be a militarily neutral country, and that is right, but it is another thing for us to be able to say whether we can patrol our own skies and protect our own airspace. In light of the Presidency coming up in the middle part of next year, what will our national security strategy do? When will we see it? What will be in it regarding the protection of our skies and airports from rogue actors operating drones? \n Deputy Rose Conway-Walsh  The very serious incident of five drones endeavouring to intercept the plane carrying President Zelenskyy last week brought our unpreparedness on defence and national security into sharp focus. Was the C70 form completed to ensure that a Garda defence co-ordinated response was put in place? Were all protocols followed? Why did the navy ship not have drone-disabling equipment? Why were airlines not informed that there was drone activity in the vicinity into which they were flying?  Lieutenant General Rossa Mulcahy told John Mooney of The Sunday Times that the military needs more personnel, intelligence and high-tech capabilities to navigate these uncertain times. Why is the Taoiseach so reluctant to allow the defence and national security committee to do what its title suggests and have oversight of national security? \n Deputy Peadar Tóibín  Can the Taoiseach categorically say that the Government is able to protect all of the EU leaders who will come to this country during the EU Presidency? Who launched the drones that were seen off Dublin Bay during the Zelenskyy visit? Why were those drones not dealt with? Where did these drones come from? Where did they retreat to? How come none of that information is known at this stage? Who was behind the drones? We have heard statements that it is likely that they may have come from Russia, but what evidence is there of this? One of the more memorable answers the Taoiseach gave to a question on national security in the previous Dáil, when the issue of the so-called Russian spy was discussed, was that he did not receive those briefings. He quite pointedly said he did not receive the information he should be receiving on that. How can people in Ireland have confidence, given the fact that our Defence Forces have been run down for so long and we can only staff one ship on the seas at any given time? \n Deputy Paul Lawless  The national security strategy consultation launched in 2019 was intended to guide our strategy on security for the past five years, from 2020-25. Despite this, no strategy was published during this timeframe. During that timeframe we had a huge ransomware attack on the HSE which put a significant number of people's lives and health in jeopardy and cost the State several million euro. What is happening on this? When will the strategy be published? It is costing the State a significant amount of money. \n Deputy Ruairí Ó Murchú  We need some sort of detail and we need to know there is a plan to address cybersecurity and hybrid warfare. The HSE attack brought to light what was probably happening to a lot of businesses which did not provide information. There has been increased funding for the National Cyber Security Centre, NCSC, but we need to get down to brass tacks. There have been drone attacks over the past while and we need to make sure that we have the capacity and technological know-how to be able to deal with these issues. There has been a failure to date in respect of funding to ensure we have the full capacity required. \n Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett  One of the biggest atrocities and national security breaches was the Dublin-Monaghan bombing carried out by the Glenanne gang. There were headlines yesterday stating that there was no collusion in the Dublin-Monaghan bombing. First, the Kenova report yesterday dealt with Stakeknife, not the Dublin-Monaghan bombing. The Denton report will not be published until January. \n The Taoiseach  It was a summary of Denton. \n Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett  The report states that the British Army had the names of the killers on the night of the bombing but nobody was ever arrested. The representatives of the families think that smacks of collusive behaviour. The authors were also extremely critical of the Irish authorities, including the Garda, and the British authorities for destroying much of the files and evidence so that the people compiling the report could not gather conclusive evidence. The whole thing stinks to high heaven. The representatives of the families have asked for a public inquiry. Will the Taoiseach listen to them? \n The Taoiseach  I thank all Deputies who raised issues in terms of national security and the national security strategy. It reflects a growing awareness and engagement with this House, not before time, in respect of security and defence issues. There has been a wilful ignoring of these issues for far too long in the House. Particular perspectives have been taken on this. Even this morning, there were references to the United Kingdom, Europe or America as being threats. The clear threats right now in this era include a Russian threat to our security and security infrastructure. We have had engagement between Iran and Russia and North Korea and Russia. North Korean soldiers have been on European soil during a period of war, seeking to violate the territorial integrity of Ukraine and its sovereignty. These are the realities we face. We wish we were not facing these realities and we would prefer a Continent at peace and so on.  The strategy will be completed. Deputy Brabazon was the first to speak and referred to self-reliance. We will develop radar capacity, and that is very close to action in terms of procurement – a lot of work has gone into that. We need to co-operate and co-ordinate with other member states in the European Union and the United Kingdom in respect of all of these issues because a pattern has developed in terms of the emergence of these drones and the violation of the airspace of EU member states. The most notable incident occurred in Copenhagen at the time of the European Political Community meeting. Denmark sought help and advice from other EU member states at that time. There were incidents in Belgium, France, Poland, in terms of train tracks and so on, and in the Baltic Sea. We are agreed that, on the drone issue, disabling technology is important.  The visit of President Zelenskyy was very effective from a security perspective. I want to make it clear to everybody that an incident did occur on that night. A small number of unidentified drones were observed in the vicinity of a Naval Service vessel on patrol off the coast of Dublin. The drones were not a threat to President Zelenskyy's aircraft - that needs to be clear - because it had safely landed quite some time prior to the incident, nor were they a threat to his departure. An operational response was put in place that was appropriate to the circumstances by the commander of the naval vessel at the time and, subsequently, by the police and military authorities working in close co-operation. They worked closely together in advance of the visit and so on.  The Garda liaised with its Ukrainian partners throughout the visit of the President on the security arrangements, including with regard to this incident. The Garda special detective unit is carrying out an investigation of the circumstances of the incident with input from the Defence Forces. It is a very concerning incident, as I said, like other similar incidents in other European states. The circumstances are suggestive of this being part of an ongoing Russian-inspired hybrid campaign against European Union and Ukrainian interests. \n Deputy Paul Murphy  I would like the Taoiseach to present some evidence. He said the circumstances are suggestive----- \n The Taoiseach  Of course the Deputy would. Could I say to Deputy Brabazon----- \n Deputy Paul Murphy  The circumstances are contested. It might well have been the Russians but I would like to see some evidence if this will be used as an agenda to undermine our neutrality. \n An Ceann Comhairle  We just cannot have this, Deputy Murphy. \n The Taoiseach  The gardaí----- \n An Ceann Comhairle  We cannot have this interaction. \n The Taoiseach  I will come back to the Deputy. \n Deputy Paul Murphy  I thank the Taoiseach. \n The Taoiseach  An Garda Síochána is substantively enhancing and has enhanced its anti-drone capabilities. It has significant capabilities on land, and the navy likewise. The military generally has the capabilities throughout all three strands: air, sea and land. We will continue to enhance that and harness all technology available in the country, both private sector but also on our university campuses that can assist in that regard.  All politics is local and Deputy Dolan asked about gardaí in east Galway and the expanding towns. We have seen good progress in the recruitment of gardaí through Templemore. It has seen its highest intake this year. The Commissioner has been allocating significant numbers to given areas. Dublin benefited initially. Cork is benefiting now, to be quite frank, in terms of the city centre. The idea is to get around to the rest of the country but to do it in significant numbers so it really has impact. I understand we are pleading for patience on the Deputy's behalf and others but we are making progress. Funding is there to keep the throughput at the level it currently is in Templemore.  On the remarks made by Deputy Murphy, the United Kingdom does not present a national security threat to Ireland. \n Deputy Paul Murphy  The Taoiseach should have read the Denton report. \n The Taoiseach  On the issue he raised in terms of the civil liberties issue within the UK, it is an issue the UK has to challenge and deal with. I noted his comment, \"nothing more than property damage\". That was interesting. I do not believe people should be----- \n Deputy Paul Murphy  Interned for property damage. \n The Taoiseach  No one should be interned and there should be trials. I love the Deputy's casual approach to property damage. It is fine. It is grand. Do not worry about it. Let us continue doing it. \n Deputy Paul Murphy  That is not what I said. \n The Taoiseach  It is what he implied. \n Deputy Paul Murphy  No, it is not. \n The Taoiseach  Ah, come on. \n Deputy Paul Murphy  The point I was making is it is not normal to hold people----- \n The Taoiseach  We discussed this----- \n An Ceann Comhairle  Deputy Murphy made his point already. \n Deputy Paul Murphy  -----without trial for over a year for property damage. \n An Ceann Comhairle  We are not doing this, Deputy Murphy. We are not doing this. \n Deputy Paul Murphy  That is the point I was making and the Taoiseach knows it. \n An Ceann Comhairle  There are other Members to be regarded. \n The Taoiseach  Can I just say to Deputy Murphy that Deputies in this House have had their property damaged. I do not believe that should lead to internment or anything like that. \n Deputy Paul Murphy  Exactly. \n The Taoiseach  No, no. \n An Ceann Comhairle  Allow the Taoiseach to answer. \n The Taoiseach  Let us be very clear. In dealing with protest, there are different levels of protest. The right to protest and to free speech is absolutely inviolable. It has to be allowed and facilitated in any true democracy. When protests get too extreme, you then impact on other people's rights to personal safety, life and property. I respectfully suggest that is something the Deputy does not pay much attention to. \n Deputy Paul Murphy  Israeli weaponry property? No. \n The Taoiseach  In terms of the other issue Deputy O'Meara raised, I have dealt with some of the aspects of what happened on the night and so forth. In terms of the EU Presidency, which people have raised, there is a lot of work under way to prepare for that. An Garda Síochána is central to the security planning and preparation. It has established a dedicated European Union Presidency co-ordination office, led by the deputy commissioner of policing operations to oversee all aspects of operational planning, logistics and inter-agency engagement. There is ongoing interdepartmental engagement through a whole range of forums. Close co-operation with European policing and security partners concerning the Presidency is ongoing, as per the norm.  In the modern security arena, you have to co-ordinate, co-operate and share intelligence with other agencies. That is absolutely key. Otherwise, you are at nothing in terms of protecting the State or protecting our people. I do not want to go into all of the details here. Some of this is security sensitive. I have a report about the drone situation. When we are discussing security, there has to be an understanding there are limits to what can be put into the public domain. That impacts further gathering and garnering of intelligence. It also impacts on our capacity to withstand further threats and so on like that. There will be a lot of planning for VIP protection, venue security, transport management, cyber resilience and public order contingencies. All of that is being worked on. It is a mammoth task. It is a huge operation. Other member states have had to do something similar. It is symptomatic of where we are in terms of the threats to European security and so forth.  I think I have dealt with most of the issues Deputy Rose Conway-Walsh raised and I was responding to her in respect of that. \n Deputy Rose Conway-Walsh  Sorry, the Taoiseach has not----- \n An Ceann Comhairle  Absolutely not, Deputy. The Deputy has to take the answer. \n Deputy Rose Conway-Walsh  I just want to put it on the record the Taoiseach has not answered. \n The Taoiseach  I am not finished yet. No member state yet, bar France in the past 48 hours or so, has attempted to disabled drones or bring them down, for different reasons. That is a matter we have to leave to the operational people in charge. We cannot dictate that sort of a response here. \n Deputy Rose Conway-Walsh  Do we have the capacity? \n An Ceann Comhairle  Deputy, no. \n The Taoiseach  We have the capacity. \n An Ceann Comhairle  If the Deputy needs to raise a Topical Issue, she can put one down. This is not a back and forth. \n The Taoiseach  Once again, it is a matter for those on the ground and in the theatre to decide the best and most appropriate response at the time.  I have dealt with some of Deputy Tóibín's questions. The national security council has been established. There is a clear structure emanating from that in terms of awareness, being briefed and so forth. I was briefed on this incident. I sought a briefing immediately on it and I received it. Obviously, it is something that will be discussed at the national security council later.  In terms of Deputy Lawless----- \n Deputy Peadar Tóibín  The Taoiseach has not categorically----- \n An Ceann Comhairle  No. If the Deputy is not happy with the answer, put down----- \n Deputy Peadar Tóibín  -----stated that EU leaders will be safe during the Presidency. \n An Ceann Comhairle  Deputy Tóibín, you know you are wrong. \n Deputy Peadar Tóibín  He also has not stated where those drones came from and where they went. \n An Ceann Comhairle  I am asking the Deputy to stop addressing the Taoiseach until he finishes his answers, \n Deputy Peadar Tóibín  He has not answered those questions. \n An Ceann Comhairle  The Deputy might not like the answer but it is the Taoiseach's answer. Do not interject again, please. \n The Taoiseach  I was just about to make the point in terms of the cybersecurity attacks. Sorry, we will protect those who are coming into this country. There is no question. Do not always be so fast to denigrate ourselves. Do not listen to all the noise out there. What happened during President Zelenskyy's visit was a good security operation by our Defence Forces and by an Garda----- \n Deputy Peadar Tóibín  Why will the Taoiseach not answer the question about the drones? \n An Ceann Comhairle  Deputy, please have respect for the other Members. \n The Taoiseach  Through the Chair, we need to acknowledge that and the very effective work of An Garda Síochána and our Defence Forces. There is a lot of noise which suits other interests to portray Ireland in a certain light. The Deputy should be wary of that, too.  Deputy Lawless raised the issue of cybersecurity. Cyber threats and attacks have increased significantly since the Russian invasion of Ukraine. Some have been by criminal elements, some have been by professionals. There are also third party state actors in respect of cybersecurity threats. It is a very serious issue for both public utilities and private sector companies. It is costing a lot of funding to deal with that. We have brought the National Cyber Security Centre under the Department of justice. It is a very strong centre and has grown in capacity very significantly in the past five years. I remember when we started it. It has developed a really strong capacity under Richard Browne. Credit needs to be given in respect of that.  I make the point to Deputy Ó Murchú that there is not a failure in funding, frankly, and finance will not be an issue here. What is an issue is the procurement timelines, both within the European defence industry and more generally. We are working to see if we can accelerate procurement. We are doing that with the radar. That is why we took a joint country approach to procurement - to fast track it. In other words, we use the experience and expertise of countries that have experience of procuring the radar we are now seeking. Everyone will be about how fast we can procure. It will also be about taking an intelligent approach in terms of what we procure. The nature of modern warfare or security threats has changed radically. We are all witnessing the drone technology change, as well as the cybersecurity. What can we do undersea? How do we protect cables? How do we protect gas connectors? It is a whole-of-society security approach that is required here. It is not the traditional, conventional approach to defence and security. We need to consider and explore that point more, perhaps.  On the Dublin-Monaghan bombing, Deputy Boyd-Barrett is correct insofar as the summary of the Denton report was produced yesterday. It is regrettable that we do not have the full Denton report. I think there was some legal action taken to try to prevent it being published in full. The Kenova report has been published. We should have a debate on the Kenova report in this House in the new year. It reveals very sordid activity by state actors but also by paramilitaries, including the Provisional IRA. The Kenova report does not pull its punches in saying it was a threat to its own community or attacked its own community. What went on is quite unbelievable.  The Denton report stated that 120 people were murdered by a network of loyalist paramilitaries and RUC and UDR personnel, including those killed in the Dublin-Monaghan bombings. It is a very sordid story and both the Kenova and Denton reports cover it. I pay tribute to Jon Boutcher, who is now the head of the PSNI, for his leadership on Kenova, and also to Iain Livingstone. They withstood a lot of pressure. We will have two comprehensive reports, if we can get the latter one published. \n An Ceann Comhairle  That is it, Taoiseach. We move to questions Nos. 12 to 28, inclusive. With 16 Members and a remaining 18 and a half minutes, it is highly unlikely we will get to the third group of questions. I ask Members to be brief. ",

The Cabinet committee on infrastructure last met on 3 November and will meet again early in the new year. The Cabinet committee works to drive infrastructure delivery and the implementation of the revised national development plan. As Members know, last week, we brought to Government the essence of that plan. The reform of the delivery of critical, growth-enhancing infrastructure is a key commitment in the programme for Government. Last week marked a major milestone on this agenda with the publication of the accelerating infrastructure report and action plan.  This plan sets out 30 high-impact and time-bound reforms to speed and scale up delivery of homes, roads, public transport, wastewater plants and energy infrastructure. Actions include legislative reforms to balance individual rights and public good, simplify regulation and consenting systems, cut administrative burden and red tape and build public acceptance and a delivery culture. The reforms align with broader housing, climate and competitiveness goals. These will be achieved by streamlining approvals to allow concurrent processing, introducing statutory timelines for major project decisions, rationalising delivery guidance to reduce duplication and complexity, enhancing procurement practices through clearer project pipelines, and fostering a delivery-focused culture that balances safeguards with urgency.  We are at a critical juncture. We have a strong economy and growing population, but our infrastructure delivery is too slow. We have a once-in-a-generation opportunity to transform this. The Government, private sector and communities must align behind delivery. The plan is underscored by the largest capital investment in the history of the State, with over €275 billion planned over the coming ten years.  Over recent weeks, Departments have published their ambitious sectoral investment plans for the next five years. Areas such as energy, transport and water will see a significant scale-up in funding and delivery, all of which will support us to address our infrastructure deficit and scale up housing. There will also be robust oversight of the Government’s performance in achieving these actions with regular reports on progress to the Cabinet committee on infrastructure. In the period ahead, the Cabinet committee will, therefore, oversee both the investments and reforms required to ensure that infrastructure is delivered as efficiently and quickly as possible. \n An Ceann Comhairle  There are 12 Deputies present. They will have 30 seconds each, which means there will be six minutes for questions and six minutes for a response. That is as fair as I can be. \n Deputy Aindrias Moynihan  The recently published national development plan update sets out an ambitious plan for key infrastructure for the years ahead. Many of the capital works are due to get under way by 2030 and others thereafter. Having a pipeline of projects ready is vital because there is so much background work involved with them. I am particularly focused on the ones after 2030. We have seen how the N22 Macroom bypass took many years to advance through the earlier stages, such as the background works, planning and design and so on. The next phase of that road is the piece between Macroom and Ballincollig. It needs to continue in the background and get through the various background stages so that we have a pipeline of projects ready to roll as soon as possible. \n Deputy Ruairí Ó Murchú  We have all seen a huge amount of flood damage and the danger of nature. While a huge amount of work has been done by local authorities and emergency services, this brings to light the need to deal expeditiously with CFRAM protections that are necessary throughout Louth. With regard to the south part of the Dundalk and Blackrock project, the promise is quarter 2 of 2027 for planning application submission. There have been promises and we have been waiting years. \n The Taoiseach  Is that CFRAM? \n Deputy Ruairí Ó Murchú  It is CFRAM. There are five particular projects throughout Louth, in Drogheda, Carlingford, Greenore, Baltray and Ardee. The lack of wastewater capacity is also causing issues. \n Deputy Albert Dolan  We need to double-track the rail line from Galway city to Athenry. The passing loop at Oranmore is under construction now. Ceannt Station is moving to be a station with five platforms. Huge investment has gone in but we must continue it because we are going to wait years for the Galway city outer bypass and the reality is that rail is the lever we can pull. We can build a double track from Athenry to Galway city which would greatly improve the quality of life for all commuters in east Galway. \n Deputy Darren O'Rourke  We need updated wind and solar farm guidelines. The wind farm guidelines are in draft form since 2019 and the last full version was in 2006. There is a commitment in the programme for Government for solar farm guidelines but recent responses say they are at a very early stage of a scoping process. When will they be ready? \n Deputy Paul Murphy  The new roll-out of BusConnects routes has been a disaster in my constituency. Constituents report that buses on the F spine route, which were supposed to provide a more direct route to the city centre and greater connectivity, are taking 20 to 30 minutes longer to get into town and providing fewer options for people trying to get to work or school. It is made worse by the frequent delays and cancellations seen across nearly all routes in Dublin South-West, including the S and W spines operated by Go-Ahead Ireland. Elsewhere, the NTA has been forced to change routes in Finglas and Chapelizod due to protests and people making their voices heard. Will the NTA do the same here or will people be forced to protest? \n Deputy Séamus McGrath  Central to a good infrastructure system is a good public transport system. I welcome the approval of BusConnects Cork by Cabinet to proceed to the planning phase. That is very welcome but we cannot wait years for improvements to the local bus service. I am sure the Taoiseach, like other public representatives in Cork, is inundated with unreliability issues relating to local bus services, such as buses not turning up, disappearing buses and inaccurate information on the travel app. It is simply not good enough and it has been going on for years. People are tired of excuses from the National Transport Authority and Bus Éireann. I ask the Taoiseach to please take this issue up and look for immediate improvements. \n Deputy Tony McCormack  While we prioritise electricity, water and transport, digital connectivity must now be treated equally. It is essential for Ireland's competitiveness. Europe has fallen behind the US and China. 5G stand-alone is under 2% in the EU and 0% in Ireland, compared with 20% in the US and 80% in China. AI, ehealth and advanced manufacturing cannot run on yesterday’s networks. If we want future investment in next-generation technology, connectivity must be prioritised. Will the Cabinet committee on infrastructure evaluate 5G stand-alone as a national priority? During Ireland's EU Presidency, will the Government push for strong, pro-investment digital policy under the digital networks Act? \n Deputy Peadar Tóibín  The Navan to Dublin rail line is not included in the national development plan review as a project that will start to be built before 2030. It has no start date for construction at all at the moment. It is up to a future government to fund the construction of a Navan to Dublin rail line. No money has been assigned or ring-fenced for that particular project, despite the fact there are 90,000 people commuting from Meath at the moment, 60,000 of whom travel by car and add to the M50 crisis. The M50 is currently grinding to a halt. If the Government wants to help fix the M50 crisis, allow people in Meath to use public transport to get to work without pushing them into cars every single day. \n Deputy Paul Lawless  Ireland faces an emergency crisis in terms of infrastructure, housing, energy and water. According to the ESRI, an additional 40,000 construction workers will be needed for the housing plan and an additional 40,000 will be needed for infrastructure. That is 80,000 construction workers who are required to meet the Government’s plan. Indeed, the Dublin metro will require 8,000 construction workers. What is the Taoiseach’s plan in order to achieve this? I speak to construction workers in Australia all the time. They want to come home but they are simply totally disenfranchised and disengaged. The Government has no interest in bringing them home. \n Deputy Rose Conway-Walsh  I know the Taoiseach will agree that the people in Mayo deserve to have proper road infrastructure. I want to specifically talk to him about the R312, which is the main road connecting Erris to the county town of Castlebar. I want it to be designated a regional strategic road because that is the only way it will get the funding it needs. It is a dangerous road. People have put up with it for years but it is time for it to be fixed. \n The Taoiseach  Which one is that? \n Deputy Rose Conway-Walsh  It is the R312. I thank the Taoiseach. \n Deputy Barry Heneghan  Ba mhaith liom ceist a chur ar an Taoiseach faoin flooding we saw in Clontarf yesterday. I thank the Minister of State, Deputy Boxer Moran, for coming down and sorting out the dreaded sandbags, but households and businesses were very worried yesterday. I had tens of people----- \n The Taoiseach  Where was that? \n Deputy Barry Heneghan  Clontarf. Does the Taoiseach not know I am a Clontarf man? The flood defence is critically needed. Will flood defences be included in critical infrastructure with the recent announcement last week? This needs to be fast-tracked and people and businesses need assurance. \n An Ceann Comhairle  Finally, Deputy Conor D. McGuinness. \n Deputy Conor D. McGuinness  Once again, I am raising with the Taoiseach the N25, which is the transport spine of Waterford's infrastructure and long regarded as the most dangerous national road in the State. There has been no funding for safety improvements. Routine maintenance, resurfacing and line painting are not good enough at this stage. Bus stops are being withdrawn. There was another HGV incident this morning just outside Dungarvan. We need to see serious investment in safety improvements on the N25 right from Rosslare to Cork city, but particularly in Waterford where there has been no funding for safety improvements. \n An Ceann Comhairle  Taoiseach, the floor is yours for five minutes. \n The Taoiseach  I love the demarcation lines. The \"Rosslare to Cork city, but particularly in Waterford\" part of it. I am sorry. I get it. Do not worry. \n Deputy Conor D. McGuinness  There have been no safety upgrades. There was a serious incident there this morning. \n The Taoiseach  It is just an observation. I will start with Deputy Aindrias Moynihan, who made a very good point. Hopefully, with this national development plan and the allocation of ten years, we will avoid this stop-start where we get a project from A to B but C is not provided for at all. We had that over the last two decades, I suppose. I recall how the Cork-Limerick road had planning in an earlier era and then that was all shelved after the financial crash and so on. If they had kept the planning going, they would have been in a much better position now to actually start. I do accept that, and particularly on the N22. The Macroom bypass has been extremely effective but there is the problem that you go along a great road into Ballincollig if you are coming from the Kerry side but then you are suddenly into what, as the Deputy was saying to me the other day, is like a parking lot for the next 20 to 40 minutes. It is a very good point that we should encourage Transport Infrastructure Ireland, TII, and others to keep thinking of the next stage and to have the planning ready and preparatory work done. I will work on that particular stretch the Deputy has referenced.  Deputy Ó Murchú raised the flood damage, CFRAM and the five projects in Louth. Deputy Barry Heneghan had a similar point. In general, flood protection schemes take a long time. Some of that is due to stakeholder engagement and public engagement, and there can be objections and so on. If any projects are of such imperative, these are. We do know that when these projects happen, they are effective in protecting against flooding. Towns that had historical flooding events have stopped them because of good infrastructure being put in. These projects invite a lot of objections. We had it in Cork city and it went the whole way to the top courts. It is only now that work is under way and all of that. There was flooding in Cork city this week. It was there because of the tidal levels, but one could argue that if you had the protections in, then businesses and people would have been protected and people could have gone in and out of town. I am very conscious of that.  With regard to Deputy Dolan's question, I will come back to the Minister. It was a good point. I do no know where we are on it in terms of the national development plan but there is no question that Galway city is facing enormous congestion, including all the areas feeding into Galway city. It is a real problem. Public transport, including rail, does give us an option, but not the whole option. We have to get the ring road done. Equally, though, the rail infrastructure is critical. I will talk to the Minister for Transport, Darragh O'Brien, about that.  Deputy O'Rourke raised the issue of the updated wind farm guidelines. The Deputy is correct that they have been a long time coming and technology has changed in the intervening period. I have asked the Minister, James Browne, to accelerate the work on the guidelines. The unit in his Department is also working on planning exemptions. There is a lot of work there. The Department is also working on rural guidelines for housing and one-off housing. There is a lot of work in that Department but I accept that we do need to bring this to a conclusion. At some stage, we need some collective debate on energy. We are all dealing with individual cases of objections to solar, objections to gas generation, objections to wind onshore, and objections to wind offshore potentially. We desperately need the offshore wind. This is something we have got to progress through planning. I am hoping we can get wind farms built, certainly through 2030 to 2031. If we do not, then we are in trouble from an energy perspective. As a collective - when I say \"collective\", I mean the entire Oireachtas - we have to try to stand back and say that there are huge challenges. We discussed security earlier. We are very dependent on the importation of fossil fuels through the interconnectors. There are real issues here that we need to be clear-eyed about. We can then take decisions once everybody realises that there are pluses and minuses in all of this.  Deputy Paul Murphy raised BusConnects, which he said was a \"disaster\"----- \n Deputy Paul Murphy  Some of it. \n The Taoiseach  That is okay. It is a word that is not uncommon. Anyway, I have had my issues with BusConnects down through the years. There have been issues for habitual users of bus services who feel the changing of services or the reorientation of scheduling and so on has eroded what they would have had prior to it. Then we had all the issues around what were, in my view, over-the-top initial plans, which then got rolled back. This seems to have been a pattern throughout the BusConnects journey and I think lessons could be learned from that. A lot of heat built up that perhaps was not necessary in the first place because a lot of stuff that was proposed was then taken away. We will engage with the National Transport Authority, NTA, in terms of what is happening. It has made a lot of progress now on BusConnects. We need a good bus transport system.  That brings me to Deputy Séamus McGrath's point. Yes, I have heard similar reports in terms of reliability. Originally, a year and a half ago, the shortage of drivers was blamed, but we definitely need to improve reliability. There had been very good stuff happening in public transport growth and so on.  I will talk to Deputy McCormack again. The Deputy is absolutely correct that America, China and others are way ahead of us in some of this in the digital space. We need to catch up fairly quickly. I will look at the 5G stand-alone issue.  Deputy Tóibín mentioned the NDP. The Navan rail line is in the NDP review----- \n Deputy Peadar Tóibín  It is not a Bill. \n The Taoiseach  The Deputy has a great capacity. He is brilliant at it, actually. From a political agitation perspective, the Deputy has a great capacity to turn what others would see as success into defeat. For the Deputy in opposition to say that we are not releasing----- \n Deputy Peadar Tóibín  That----- \n An Ceann Comhairle  Do not interrupt. \n Deputy Peadar Tóibín  I have to, a Cheann Comhairle. \n An Ceann Comhairle  No, Deputy Tóibín, do not even dare. \n The Taoiseach  The Deputy is trying to ask how I can----- \n An Ceann Comhairle  Deputy Tóibín will have to look for it afterwards. \n The Taoiseach  I spoke to the Minister, Deputy O'Brien, about this and he is very clear that the Navan line is going ahead. \n Deputy Peadar Tóibín  There is no date for construction. \n An Ceann Comhairle  Do not even think about it. \n The Taoiseach  The Government is absolutely committed to it.  On Deputy Lawless's question, there is a huge increase in apprenticeships. We are recruiting people back. We are anxious for people to come back into the country, and people are coming back into the country. The construction industry is confident enough in terms of the numbers for getting the housing done, for example, and the huge retrofit programme that is going on as well.  I will talk and engage with the Minister in respect of Deputy Conway-Walsh's query on the R312.  Regarding Deputy Heneghan's question, I have discussed that in terms of Clontarf and flood relief generally. It will be part of critical infrastructure, absolutely. I see it as critical infrastructure because it is a big threat to us. The storms are worse and they are more severe. We need to accelerate the protection of people, households and businesses in that respect.  On the N25, we need to get the bypasses along that road. That is a section of the road that definitely needs improvement.  I thank the Ceann Comhairle. \n An Ceann Comhairle  I thank the Taoiseach and Members. For future reference, if there needs to be back and forth, this is not the forum in which to pose a question. \n Deputy Ruairí Ó Murchú  In the review----- \n An Ceann Comhairle  We have a Dáil reform committee today at which it will be discussed. \n The Taoiseach  We need a bit of entertainment and lively engagement, too. \n An Ceann Comhairle  This is not the forum, Taoiseach.

The HSE advise that the drugs, medicines and non-drug items reimbursable under the LTI Scheme are intended for the treatment of the primary condition.  The Core Lists were developed following detailed consultation with Medical Officers, HSE Pharmacists and the HSE Medicines Management Programme (MMP). The HSE is satisfied that all medicines that should be necessary for the treatment of each primary LTI Scheme condition are provided on these Core Lists. Core Lists are reviewed every few years to ensure that they reflect current prescribing practices and treatments of the primary illness. ",

        "answerText": " Tánaiste and Minister for Finance  Tracker mortgage failings by lenders have caused significant distress and, in some cases, have had devastating consequences for customers.  Following engagement and intervention with a number of lenders, the Central Bank of Ireland launched the Tracker Mortgage Examination in 2015.  The aim of the examination was to ensure that lenders identified all impacted borrowers and, to the extent possible, put them back in the position they would have been in if the lenders’ failings had not occurred.  Confidentiality clauses or non-disclosure agreements were not a feature of the framework of the Tracker Mortgage Examination, and the Central Bank did not require the signing of confidentiality clauses where a customer received an award of redress and compensation.  In general, settlements of litigation proceedings are voluntary. As is the case with other regulatory authorities, the Central Bank of Ireland has no jurisdiction to interfere with or dictate the terms of private agreements that have been reached by the parties to a dispute situation.  It should be noted, from a regulatory perspective, these types of clauses do not prevent scrutiny by the Central Bank.  Since the completion of the supervisory phase of the Tracker Mortgage Examination in 2019, the Central Bank continues to monitor the outcomes of complaints, appeals and court cases.  Where such settlements do arise and could have a broader impact for other customers, the Central Bank has required lenders to provide the same benefit to similarly affected customers. ",

        "answerText": " Tánaiste and Minister for Finance  The Government continues to prioritise insurance reform, with a particular focus on reducing insurance premiums, including public liability insurance, and improving the overall affordability and accessibility of cover.  Significant progress has been achieved through the 2020 Action Plan for Insurance Reform. Key measures delivered include the introduction of the Personal Injuries Guidelines, legal reforms to rebalance the duty of care, and the establishment of the Office to Promote Competition in the Insurance Market. These actions have helped to create a more competitive market and have supported new entrants into the Irish insurance sector.  Government launched a new Action Plan for Insurance Reform on 24 July, which sets out a comprehensive set of targeted measures to further improve affordability, availability, and transparency across the insurance sector, including public liability insurance. Among the priority actions is a strong emphasis on enhancing market competitiveness by engaging directly with the international insurance market to attract new providers to Ireland. This approach aims to expand supply, drive greater competition, and reduce costs for consumers and businesses.  The Government also remains committed to addressing the issue of public liability insurance costs through the work of the Office for the Promotion of Competition in the Insurance Market. In terms of business and commercial insurance, existing providers have also indicated that they are expanding their risk appetite to underserved areas and various sectors are reporting reductions in the rate being charged for liability cover.  Government remains firmly committed to achieving a fairer, more sustainable, and competitive insurance market. The focus is on ensuring that the benefits of these reforms are fully realised, delivering tangible improvements in cost, choice, and access to insurance for individuals, businesses, and community and voluntary organisations across Ireland.

        "answerText": " Tánaiste and Minister for Finance  Insurance reform is a priority for this Government. A wide range of actions to reform the insurance sector have been taken since 2020, with particular focus on reducing insurance premiums, including public liability insurance.  The 2020 Action Plan for Insurance Reform delivered key measures including the introduction of the Personal Injuries Guidelines, legal reforms to rebalance the duty of care, and the establishment of the Office to Promote Competition in the Insurance Market (OPCIM). These reforms have contributed to greater market stability and have supported new market entrants such as OUTsurance, Revolut, and several Managing General Agents.  The OPCIM also continues to play a role in restoring insurance availability in sectors that previously faced substantial challenges, including adventure tourism, equestrian centres, childcare services, inflatable hire, and high-footfall hospitality businesses. In addition, feedback from insurance stakeholders has indicated that public liability insurance issues are showing signs of some easing; more capacity is entering the market and certain insurance rates are reducing. This is an indication that the Government’s reform agenda is having an impact.  The Government has also shown its appetite for further reform of the sector by re-establishing the Cabinet Subgroup on Insurance Reform, which I chair as Tánaiste and in developing a new Action Plan for Insurance Reform. The new Action Plan, published on 24 July, sets out an updated and comprehensive suite of targeted measures to further improve affordability, availability, and transparency across the sector. A central priority is enhancing market competitiveness by proactively engaging with the international insurance market to attract new providers to Ireland, thereby increasing supply and exerting downward pressure on premiums. The subgroup takes a whole-of-government approach in the implementation of the Action Plan.  I am firmly of the view that securing a more sustainable and competitive market through deepening and widening the supply of insurance will support broader availability and affordability across the market, benefiting consumers and businesses alike.

        "answerText": " Tánaiste and Minister for Finance  Tracker mortgage failings by lenders have caused significant distress and, in some cases, have had devastating consequences for customers.  Following engagement and intervention with a number of lenders, the Central Bank of Ireland launched the Tracker Mortgage Examination in 2015.  The aim of the examination was to ensure that lenders identified all impacted borrowers and, to the extent possible, put them back in the position they would have been in if the lenders’ failings had not occurred.  Confidentiality clauses or non-disclosure agreements were not a feature of the framework of the Tracker Mortgage Examination and the Central Bank did not require the signing of confidentiality clauses where a customer received an award of redress and compensation.  In general, settlements of litigation proceedings are voluntary. As is the case with other regulatory authorities, the Central Bank of Ireland has no jurisdiction to interfere with or dictate the terms of private agreements that have been reached by the parties to a dispute situation.  It should be noted, from a regulatory perspective, these types of clauses does not prevent scrutiny by the Central Bank.  Since the completion of the supervisory phase of the Tracker Mortgage Examination in 2019, the Central Bank continues to monitor the outcomes of complaints, appeals and court cases.  Where such settlements do arise and could have a broader impact for other customers, the Central Bank has required lenders to provide the same benefit to similarly affected customers. ",

It is the first ever Plan of its kind in the history of the State and a central element in the move towards a fully bilingual public service under the Official Languages Acts 2003 and 2021.  Overall responsibility for the preparation of this Plan fell to the Irish Language Services Advisory Committee, established under the Act, with a range of organisations from across the public sector represented at a senior level participating.  This National Plan, which is based on five specific strategic themes, is intended to act as a roadmap for public bodies in terms of systematically increasing and improving the number and quality of Irish language public services that they provide as well as the number of staff competent in Irish they have available to provide such services - in line with the Act’s overarching recruitment target that 20% of recruits to public bodies will be competent in Irish by 31 December 2030.  The National Plan is to be supported by two action plans, which will set out the specific actions to be undertaken towards achieving the Plan’s high-level strategic objectives. Work has been underway since the publication of the National Plan on the first of these Action Plans and, following extensive consultation and engagement across Government and beyond, It is intended to submit this Action Plan to Government shortly.  For further information on progress to date, the Deputy may be interested to note that the National Plan identifies the progress reports to be prepared annually by the Advisory Committee under the Act as being the primary monitoring mechanism for the Plan. These reports are submitted to the Minister and An Coimisinéir Teanga, with An Coimisinéir Teanga in turn submitting a commentary on said reports to the Minister. Both the report and the commentary are then laid before each House of the Oireachtas. Additionally, the Minister also prepares his own annual report on the implementation of the Act in general, which is also laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas. The most recent of all of the above-mentioned reports can, accordingly, be found on the website of the Houses of the Oireachtas. ",

The Government's five-year strategy, Sustainable, Inclusive and Empowered Communities, which has been extended to end 2025, aims to support the community and voluntary sector. This whole of Government strategy, led by my Department, is implemented and overseen collaboratively with the sector through the Cross Sector Group on Local and Community Development.  The community and voluntary sector is quite diverse and receives financial support through a wide range of funding programmes and schemes from Government departments and agencies, including my own Department.  My Department’s Social Inclusion and Community Activation Programme (SICAP) is our country’s primary social inclusion intervention. The current SICAP Programme, which began on 1st of January 2024 will run until the end of 2028. An increase in core funding of €1.5m has been secured for the programme in 2026, in line with the Programme for Government’s commitments to incrementally increase funding for SICAP, bringing the annual funding in 2026 to over €50m.  As part of funding arrangements for SICAP, Programme Implementers are permitted to use up to 25% of their overall annual allocation to cover administration costs associated with delivering the programme, including staff salary and pension costs.  The Community Services Programme (CSP) currently supports 426 community-based organisations, with a budget of €59.4m allocated for 2026, to provide 446 local services nationwide, through a social enterprise model. The CSP contribution is not aligned to the minimum wage and is not intended to meet the full employment cost of supported posts. The contribution must be co-funded by other sources, for example, from income received from the public for the use of their facilities and services.  My Department has no operational role in relation to the wage rates, including pension obligations arising for community development organisations, including CSP-supported organisations. These are solely matters for the Boards of those organisations, to manage as the respective employers, subject to compliance with employment legislation. Notwithstanding this, increased funding has been provided over the past three years to most CSP-funded organisations to support increases in the costs of employment.  The New Solutions Social Innovation Fund, which is co-funded through the European Social Fund+ 2021-2027, is aimed at reducing the risk of poverty and social exclusion, with an emphasis on disadvantaged groups. Under the initiative, salary and pension costs for employees are allowable costs, subject to evidenced invoice payments.  Údarás na Gaeltachta has a comprehensive strategic development approach to managing the increased demand for funding from Gaeltacht community development organisations, with a 59% increase in direct funding provided to these organisations over the past five years. The distribution of funding is based on annual work plans prepared by the community development organisations. The Community Development Unit within an tÚdarás in collaboration with the relevant officers and Regional Managers, carries out a comprehensive assessment of the applications to address the needs of the organisation.

        "answerText": " Minister for Justice, Home Affairs and Migration  The Government is committed to a health-led approach to drug use, firmly believing that individuals experiencing problematic drug use should be met with compassion, dignity, and appropriate care. In line with Programme for Government commitments, the Department of Health is now preparing a successor National Drugs Strategy to cover the period 2026-2029.  This will be informed by an evaluation of the existing strategy and consultations with stakeholders, along with the recommendations of the Citizen’s Assembly on Drug Use.  My colleague the Minister of State for Public Health, Wellbeing and the National Drugs Strategy, Jennifer Murnane O’Connor established a Steering Group in September 2025, chaired by Dr. Sarah Morton, to provide oversight and guidance to the development of the successor National Drugs Strategy.  The group, which includes a representative from my Department, has been tasked with overseeing the drafting of a successor national drugs strategy, as well as a two-year action plan to support its delivery, for completion by December 2025. A reference group is supporting the Steering Group's work providing real-world knowledge and lived experience of drug use to inform the drafting of the new strategy.  As Minister for Justice I am fully committed to helping to significantly reduce the harms caused to families and communities by illicit drug use. The three main policy objectives my Department are seeking to achieve in this area are:  • tackling organised crime;  • minimising the harms caused to those with addiction issues; and  • diverting people from involvement in crime and illicit drug-related activity.  The Government is fully committed to providing An Garda Síochána with the resources it needs to fight organised crime. This is reflected in the unprecedented allocation of over €2.59 billion in Budget 2026.  Operation Tara, aims to disrupt, dismantle and prosecute drug trafficking networks, at all levels – international, national and local – involved in the sale and supply of illegal drugs. Under Operation Tara, individuals and groups involved in the drug trade are the target of enforcement activity based on intelligence and the latest crime trends.  Two examples of Garda success in the past month alone include:  • Searches at a residential addresses in the Dublin and Wicklow areas on 13 November 2025 in which 98 kilos of cannabis and 2 kilos of cocaine – with a combined estimated street value of €2.1 million – were seized.  • As part of an intelligence led operation, Gardaí and Revenue Customs Service, seized 220 kgs of herbal cannabis with an estimated value of €4.4 million on Friday 14 November 2025.  In terms of minimising harms, the Garda Commissioner has tasked an Inspector in every Garda Division to respond to the issue of drug-related intimidation. Information in relation to the Drug-Related Intimidation Reporting Programme and a list of the nominated Inspectors countrywide is available on the Garda website.  In May, alongside my colleague Minister Murnane O’Connor, I launched the DRIVE (Drug related intimidation & violence engagement) project. DRIVE’s primary goal is to establish effective systems and structures for a unified, timely, and sensitive response to drug-related intimidation. It focuses on responding to incidents, supporting those affected, and preventing future occurrences.  DRIVE promotes interagency collaboration by bringing together law enforcement, health services, social services, and community organisations to tackle Drug Related Intimidation from multiple perspectives. It operates on a national scale across Ireland, ensuring consistent and comprehensive support in all regions.  There are over 400 publicly funded drug services, including family support services, across the country which can advise and support people affected by Drug Related Intimidation. Family support services are critical because drug-related violence nearly always becomes an issue for the whole family. More information can be found online on the Driveproject.ie website.  We also have a particular focus on targeting the work of organised crime groups, which inflict intimidation and violence on families and communities, while grooming and coercing vulnerable young people into drug-related criminal activity.  A number of key actions have been taken as part of our plan to tackle illegal drug use, including:  • Increasing the maximum sentence for conspiracy to murder from 10 years to life in prison to tackle those who direct gangland and drug related crime;  • New laws have been enacted which criminalise the grooming of children into a life of crime;  • Drafting new laws which will provide for the use of facial recognition technology in the investigation of certain drug offences;  • Rolling out a support programme to break the link between the gangs and the children they try to recruit.

        "answerText": " Minister of State at the Department of Justice, Home Affairs and Migration  I understand the Deputy has clarified that his question relates to join family and employment visas.  I can advise the Deputy that there are currently seven overseas Visa Offices in addition to the Visa Office in Dublin. They are located in Abuja, Beijing, London, Moscow, Ankara, Abu Dhabi and New Delhi. In addition, the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade process certain visa applications in Irish Embassies abroad under delegated sanction from my Department.  I can assure the Deputy that while processing times can vary across the different Visa Offices and Irish Embassies, the majority of visas are processed within stated target times. Most short-term and employment visa applications are determined in a matter of weeks.  The current processing times of applications for join family visas varies depending on the circumstances when the application is made. If a non-EEA national is moving to Ireland because they have been granted a Critical Skills Employment Permit they can apply for join family visas at the same time as their own employment visa. When these visas are applied for together, they are processed in tandem and are typically completed in under eight weeks. My Department aims to process join family visa applications made in other circumstances within 12 months.  I can assure the Deputy the majority of join family visas receive a first instance decision within the 12 month business target. In the first nine months of 2025 the average processing time for a join family application was approximately 100 days.  It should be noted that some applications can take considerably longer. Processing times for all applications are influenced by a number of factors. The time it can take varies depending on the type and complexity of application; individual circumstances; peak application periods; such as holidays or the start of the school year; and, crucially, the quality and completeness of the application lodged. Verifying an application is an important part of our immigration system and the checks involved can take time to complete.  In 2025, to the end of September, my Department has received 9,790 employment visa applications, granted 8,682 applications, and refused 1,272. It should be noted that decisions issued in any year may relate to applications which were received in previous years due to the time taken to process applications.  These figures include employment visas sought on the basis of being issued an Employment Permit issued by Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, and Atypical Working Scheme Permissions issued by my Department.  I understand that extended wait times can be frustrating for applicants, and I want to assure anyone who has made an application for a visa that my Department is doing everything possible to progress these applications as quickly as possible.  In 2024, approximately 201,000 visa applications, of all types, were received by the Visa Division of my Department. This reflects an increase of 21%, compared to 2023, with over 35,000 additional applications received. These increases have continued, in the first nine months of 2025, my Department's Visa Division received approximately 166,000 visa applications and has issued over 153,000 decisions. This reflects an increase in applications of 5.5% compared to the same period in 2024. My officials are working to meet the increased level of demand, and over 8,200 additional visa decisions have issued in the first nine months of 2025, compared to the same period in 2024.  Processing times and decisions at the Dublin Visa Office and the Overseas Visa Offices can be checked at the following link: www.irishimmigration.ie/visa-decisions/ ",

        "answerText": " The Taoiseach  I propose to take Questions Nos. 1 to 12 together.  The UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer and I both attended the recent G20 Summit in South Africa. We had a number of conversations in the margins of meetings there, including on the situation in Ukraine, on which an informal meeting of the coalition of the willing took place. Previously, I met with Prime Minister Starmer at Chequers on 12 September. We discussed a broad range of matters, including the positive state of bilateral relations between Ireland and the UK. We also discussed the legacy framework - this was one of the reasons I went to Chequers - which was published subsequently on 19 September. The Prime Minister and I took note of progress on the UK-Ireland 2030 programme of strategic co-operation since the summit on 6 March on implementation across each of the programme’s four pillars of security, justice and global issues; climate, energy and innovation; growth, trade and investment; and culture, education and people-to-people links. We looked ahead to the second UK-Ireland summit, which Ireland will host in the spring of 2026. This work complements that undertaken under the British-Irish Council, which will meet in Wales later this week, and the British-Irish Intergovernmental Conference, which took place in Dublin on 17 November.  The Prime Minister and I also discussed a range of international issues, including the catastrophic situation in Gaza. We agreed in particular on the then urgent need for a ceasefire, the release of hostages and the delivery of humanitarian aid at scale, as well as finding a pathway to a two-state solution for a lasting peace. We committed to continue to work together with the coalition of the willing to strengthen support for Ukraine and increase pressure on Russia to stop its war of aggression on the people of Ukraine.  Deputies may wish to be aware that the First Minister of Scotland, John Swinney, was in Ireland last week to mark the agreement of a new bilateral co-operation framework between Ireland and Scotland. The new framework includes six broad areas for future co-operation, including in the context of a strengthened Ireland-UK relationship. I also met with First Minister Swinney in Government Buildings during his visit. \n Deputy Brendan Smith  I have had numerous opportunities in this House to welcome in general terms the legacy framework that was agreed between the British and Irish Governments and published in early September. There is an urgent need to enact legislation to give effect to the provisions outlined in the framework. Did the Taoiseach detect an urgency or a very strong commitment from the UK Prime Minister on the need to get this issue dealt with? Many families have waited for justice for decades and decades. We have to move on and get progress on the rights, the concerns and the grief that engulfs so many families of victims for many decades now. At the end of this month, we will mark the 53rd anniversary of the Belturbet bombing, which cost the lives of two young teenagers. We also have had significant dates in relation to commemorations, for example marking the terrible atrocities in Monaghan and Dublin in May 1974. There are so many atrocities for which nobody has been brought to justice. We cannot ever attach enough urgency to trying to deal, once and for all, with legacy issues. \n Deputy Ruth Coppinger  The right to protest against the genocide in Palestine is being severely undermined the UK and this is being carried through to the North as well. I want to raise a case with the Taoiseach that he could raise with the Prime Minister. This is the case of Saoirse Wagner, a student at Queen's University in Belfast, who is being threatened with expulsion for taking part in a peaceful, calm and non-threatening protest on the issue of Palestine. The Palestine assembly in the college protested at the careers fair to highlight companies that are participating in the genocide. I think the Taoiseach will agree with me that taking part in student protest is a fundamental right and so important in our democracy. To threaten a student with their whole third level education being completely taken away for participating in a peaceful protest is something we should take a stand against. I ask the Taoiseach to make representations to the college. Saoirse is known to me. I know that she would not participate in anything violent. I ask the Taoiseach to take this case on board. \n Deputy Ruairí Ó Murchú  We are coming up to the 50th anniversary of the Dundalk bombing, which happened on 19 December 1975. Dundalk lost Hugh Watters, who was a local tailor and a well-respected man, and Jack Rooney, a fireman and a man who worked for the council. Obviously, this was devastating for their families. A memorial event has been organised by the families. It is going to happen near the courthouse, where there is a plaque, at 6.15 p.m. on Friday, 19 December. I think it is very important that we commemorate this 50th anniversary. It was the same night as the attack on Donnelly's Bar in Silverbridge where three people were killed. This was carried out by the Glenanne gang. We know this was a UVF gang which had members of the UDR and the RUC within it and obviously, the British state was up to its neck in relation to it. I would ask about the engagement around producing a framework that will actually deliver for families like these that have been failed and that Britain does not walk away from its role and its dirty war that it fought in Ireland. \n Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett  The Taoiseach said he discussed Gaza and Palestine with Keir Starmer. A standard tactic of the Israeli state has been to say that anybody who criticises Israel for genocide, apartheid, ethnic cleansing or the persecution of Palestinians, is somehow antisemitic. Keir Starmer, of course, has a record of going along with that nonsense and attacking people like Jeremy Corbyn, who is one of the most long-standing anti-racists and an absolute opponent of antisemitism. It is an outrageous accusation. We have now seen an instance of our own ambassador being dressed down by an Israeli minister, who accused the Irish people and the Irish Government of antisemitism. I would like to know what the Taoiseach thinks about that. Is he capitulating to that bullying by the Israeli state by intervening on the proposal to rename Herzog Park? This is an entirely justified proposal, given Chaim Herzog's history of involvement in ethnic cleansing of Palestinians. \n Deputy Peadar Tóibín  A series health crisis is arising in the North of Ireland at the moment. Sinn Féin, the DUP, the UUP and the Alliance Party are closing down key hospital services in Daisy Hill Hospital, Enniskillen and Causeway Hospital in Derry. These closures are having a significant effect on services. Patients in Craigavon hospital are waiting for 19 hours to see their emergency doctor. The waiting time at the emergency department in the Royal Victoria Hospital is nine hours.  One day, there were 40 ambulances stuck at hospitals trying to deliver their patients. The longest waiting time was 13 hours. I pay tribute to the SOS Causeway Hospital campaign and Gemma Brolly, who is involved in that.  The boss of the British Medical Association in the North stated that an all-Ireland GP service would be a way to help resolve these crises. Daisy Hill, Enniskillen and Causeway all have hinterlands that feed into the South of Ireland in areas where there is great need for hospital services too. Is the Taoiseach speaking to the British Prime Minister about developing an all-Ireland health service? \n Deputy Liam Quaide  When I asked the Taoiseach about flood relief for east Cork villages last week, he accused me of being sly in how I had raised the question. That adjective could be more fairly levelled at his British counterpart, Keir Starmer, who built his political career on the basis of being a human rights lawyer and unifier of the left. In power, he has enthusiastically supported the imprisonment of people for years who protest against climate inaction, along with the designation of protesters of genocide as terrorists. I fully appreciate that the UK makes its own political decisions and that we have to maintain good relations with political leaders with whom we often might have major disagreements, but it is also true that Irish citizens are affected by Starmer’s authoritarian crackdown on peaceful protests. Acclaimed novelist Sally Rooney has been prevented from collecting a prestigious Sky Arts award in person due to fears of arrest for her support of Palestine Action. Great-grandmother Máire Ní Mhurchú, originally from Douglas in Cork, was arrested in London in September, along with her sisters Gráinne and Olga, for a peaceful protest against genocide. When the Taoiseach met Keir Starmer, did he raise with him his government's aggressive and authoritarian approach to peaceful protest and its impact on Irish as well as British citizens? \n Deputy Shane Moynihan  With reference to the Taoiseach’s meeting with British Prime Minister, Keir Starmer, I note the progress made by the UK Government with regard to dealing with legacy, and I compliment Deputy Smith on his work in this area in particular.  I note the publication this week by the House of Commons Northern Ireland Affairs Committee around legacy. One of the more interesting recommendations was that Ireland needs to do more with regard to legacy. I would love to hear the Taoiseach's thoughts on that given that all of the legacy investigations of this country have been ECHR compliant, which is not necessarily something that can be said in the case of the UK.  I call for increased and accelerated action on, in particular, the Dublin and Monaghan bombings. That has been raised many times in this House and it needs to fall under the ambit of the legacy issues as well.  What engagement has the Taoiseach had with the Prime Minister on the ongoing humanitarian disaster of a crisis in Sudan, somewhere the international community needs to step up and pay attention? I wish to hear his thoughts on their engagement on that matter. \n Deputy Rose Conway-Walsh  There can be no watering-down of the commitments made in the British and Irish Governments' joined legacy framework. There are parts of that framework I question but it is very important. I welcome the Northern Ireland Affairs Committee report on this legacy legislation. The primary legislation underpinning the political framework is moving through Westminster. The bottom line is that the legislation must command the confidence of the families and be human rights compliant in order for it to properly deal with the legacy of the past. Reports that the legislation, which is already weak in parts, could be watered down are extremely concerning and will not be accepted. It is deeply concerning that any legislation would provide the British Secretary of State with the power to veto disclosure on national security grounds for family reports from the information retrieval body, the ICIR and the new legacy commission. All families and survivors have the right to have an Article 2-compliant investigation into the deaths of their loved ones. \n Deputy Paul Murphy  A new defence co-operation agreement with Britain is to be signed soon. Members of the House of Lords are saying it will mean a stronger defence relationship between Ireland and the UK. The Taoiseach himself has said there must be very close co-operation with the British when it comes to security. Does he really think that is what Irish people want? Has he forgotten that our neutrality originates from an anti-imperialist struggle against Britain, a struggle Fianna Fáll once fought for? Can he tell us what will be in this new military agreement? Britain is increasing its military expenditure by £67.7 billion. It is an active participant in the genocide in Gaza. Are we going to be expected to massively increase our military expenditure, too, as part of this new agreement? \n The Taoiseach  I thank all of the Deputies for raising a range of issues. Deputy Smith was the first to raise the issue of legacy. I believe there is a sincere commitment on behalf of the British Government as to the implementation of the legacy framework. That is shared by Prime Minister Starmer and, indeed, Secretary of State Hilary Benn, who has acted honourably in all of the negotiations and discussions in respect of the legacy framework. I visited Chequers last September specifically on legacy, along with other issues. It was important to meet with Keir Starmer on that. He has experience of the North from a former role there.  I know the Deputy has been a strong advocate on Belturbet and Monaghan and Dublin. From our perspective, it is important that the Denton report may shed some light on the Monaghan bombing and related issues Deputy Ó Murchú raised. This is relevant also to the activities of the Glennane gang and we eagerly await its publication. Operation Kenova was quite good, in my view, particularly in terms of the victims, who were very impressed with Jon Boutcher when he was in charge of Kenova. They articulated to me that he was one of the first people they met who understood where the families of the victims are coming from.  Deputy Moynihan also raised legacy. We have responsibilities in our jurisdiction. If assertions are made about us, we need to robustly deal with them, but the most effective way to do it is to make sure we respond properly to legacy. As part of the framework agreement, the British Government has, with speed, produced its legislation. That demonstrates the seriousness with which it is approaching this essential work. We are also producing legislation once the UK legislation is enacted. The Minister, Deputy O'Callaghan, has said he is hopeful the general scheme of the Bill will be published in April or May of next year. Enabling reciprocal co-operation between the two jurisdictions is at the heart of the agreed joint framework on legacy.  Additionally, as part of the joint framework agreement, the Garda Commissioner has agreed to the establishment by the end of this year of a dedicated unit as a central point of contact in relation to Troubles-related investigations undertaken by An Garda Síochána. That is an important step forward. Unionist communities in the North have always had a view. We did the Smithwick tribunal and we dealt with it quickly as part of the commitment of earlier agreements, but we do also have to be upfront in terms of the legacy framework and respond properly and comprehensively in relation to that.  I say to Deputy Ó Murchú and all those concerned about legacy that it is not about British state violence alone. It is about that, but it is also about the role of the paramilitaries, such as the Provisional IRA. I have met families of victims who have had no closure at all in terms of atrocities committed by the Provisional IRA or the Ulster loyalist groups. The focus has to be broad-based. There is an opportunity in this legacy framework to give closure to families once and for all, after decades of a lack of closure.  Deputy Coppinger raised the issue of Saoirse Wagner and asked me to talk to the Queen's University authorities. The right to protest is sacrosanct. A number of Deputies have raised this issue. Sometimes protests impede other people from doing their normal work, which is a problem. People are entitled to protest. When the war in Gaza started, I was addressing a group of 100 law students, but the objective of a protest was to stop me and to interfere with the exercise and engagement with about 100 law students. People were shouting internally, security asked them to leave and eventually they did. I was in no doubt that the whole purpose was that I would not have that engagement. Where is the balance of rights there in terms of my freedom to speak as a public representative or the freedom of people in the community to hear me? A lot of protests have crossed the line, in my opinion, with a view to stopping things happening. During a consultative forum on security challenges that I hosted as Minister for foreign affairs two years ago, the protests at that were not about protests. They were deliberately calculated to disrupt the event. \n Deputy Paul Murphy  The forum was not about consultation either, was it? \n The Taoiseach  It was a legitimate consultation. If the Deputy believes in freedom of assembly and freedom of speech, what he and like-minded people were about was stopping that from even happening.  They never complain about that. It is fair play for them to do that. There is balance here. \n Deputy Ruth Coppinger  I do not know about the protest. \n The Taoiseach  Of course the Deputy knows about the protests. She knows all about them. \n Deputy Ruth Coppinger  I have no idea what the Taoiseach is on about. \n The Taoiseach  They were on the public television, for God's sake. \n Deputy Ruth Coppinger  I do not organise every protest in Ireland. \n The Taoiseach  They were on the public television, in the media and everywhere. In this House----- \n Deputy Paul Murphy  That does not make it terrorism. \n The Taoiseach  -----assertions were made. I am not calling it that. \n An Ceann Comhairle  The Deputies are only delaying the next question. \n The Taoiseach  The point I am illustrating is that there are different forms of protest on the continuum and some of those forms are unacceptable----- \n Deputy Ruth Coppinger  We did not organise----- \n An Ceann Comhairle  Deputy, stop engaging, please. \n The Taoiseach  -----as an infringement of the rights of people generally. That is the point I am making. \n An Ceann Comhairle  The time has elapsed. \n Deputy Ruth Coppinger  I am just correcting a mistruth there. \n The Taoiseach  It is not a one-way street----- \n An Ceann Comhairle  It does not matter. \n The Taoiseach  -----all of the time. That is the point I am making. Ramming gates at Shannon Airport is not a legitimate form of protest. Stopping trade through Dublin Port is not a legitimate form of protest----- \n Deputy Ruth Coppinger  We are not. \n The Taoiseach  -----because people's livelihood depends on it. Eighty per cent of trade in this country goes through Dublin Port. Having a problem with a company is not a justification, in my view, for disrupting the entire port. I have no problem having a debate. I participated in protests as a student. I think student protests are important. \n Deputy Ruth Coppinger  Did you? \n An Ceann Comhairle  This is not a debate. \n The Taoiseach  I did, actually \n Deputy Ruth Coppinger  Okay, I will look that one up. \n The Taoiseach  The Deputy can do that. Joe Duffy was put in prison as a result of that protest. It was to do with medical cards. There you are now. Students in this country automatically had medical cards at one time. That was taken away in the eighties. The point is that legitimate protests----- \n Deputy Ruth Coppinger  Which party was that? \n An Ceann Comhairle  Ah please, Deputy, we have to get through this. \n The Taoiseach  I think it was the Deputy's former colleagues in the Labour Party. \n An Ceann Comhairle  Taoiseach, are we moving on? \n The Taoiseach  That is history. Protests happen, and I have no issue with that, but there is a continuum. I will take the Ceann Comhairle's advice.  To Deputy Ó Murchú, I have dealt with some of the legacy issues, which Deputy Conway-Walsh also raised. I will talk to Queen's University on that point. In terms of the Dundalk bombing and the Glennane gang, I hope Operation Denton will shed light on that. \n Deputy Peadar Tóibín  What about the health services? \n The Taoiseach  I will come to that. On Deputy Boyd Barrett's question, there is no relationship between the strategy and policy of the Israeli Government and my views on the renaming of Herzog Park. I have a very basic view. Throughout the history of the State, there have been namings and renamings. I am, and have been, a student of history and I taught students. I always showed them that the names of parks could be the remnants of empire or anything, but they are windows to explain the history of a given subject or personality. If we keep shutting down everything that is named after somebody, there will be no history left. \n Deputy Paul Murphy  When was it named Herzog Park? \n The Taoiseach  There will not be a history left. \n Deputy Paul Murphy  When was it named Herzog Park? It was ten or 20 years ago. \n An Ceann Comhairle  Please move on, Taoiseach. \n The Taoiseach  That is not the point. \n Deputy Paul Murphy  That is not history. \n The Taoiseach  It is, actually, if you go back through his father and before that and examine how Jewish communities came to Ireland in the first instance. There is huge history there, for God's sake. \n Deputy Paul Murphy  But not the park. \n An Ceann Comhairle  Deputy----- \n Deputy Paul Murphy  It is still history if you change the name of the park. \n The Taoiseach  As a historian and someone who is interested in history, I would be very careful. \n An Ceann Comhairle  -----you are verging on disruptive. \n The Taoiseach  Breandán Ó hEithir wrote in Lig Sinn i gCathú about the thirties when places were being shut down left, right and centre. \n An Ceann Comhairle  Seven more Deputies, Taoiseach. \n The Taoiseach  There is a lot more to it than that, but it has nothing to do with this. I can put Deputy Boyd Barrett at ease in that regard. \n An Ceann Comhairle  There are seven more Deputies to answer, Taoiseach. \n The Taoiseach  By the way, I object, like the Deputy does, to Israel's consistent messaging that if you are not onside, you are offside or antisemitic. That is wrong. You are entitled to be against Israeli Government policy and criticise it and not be labelled antisemitic. That is absolutely correct and I support it.  Deputy Tóibín should talk to his former colleagues in Sinn Féin in earnest and engage with them on the health services in Northern Ireland. That is one issue. There are broader problems with the National Health Service generally, but there are real issues in Northern Ireland. There is no question about the pressures on the health service there. \n Deputy Peadar Tóibín  There are benefits to an all-Ireland health service. \n An Ceann Comhairle  Deputy, this is not a continuous back-and-forth. I am not allowing that. This is Taoiseach's Questions. The Deputy has asked a question and is getting an answer. \n The Taoiseach  Under the shared island initiative, we are trying to do specific projects and programmes, for example in paediatric and cardiovascular health, cardiac surgery and the cancer centre at Altnagelvin hospital. Those are good programmes that have worked very well.  Deputy Quaide referred to Prime Minister Starmer. I do not see him as an authoritarian person when I meet him. I spoke about the continuum of protest. I am not au fait with British security services or why they came to do what they did in respect of Palestine Action. We have proceeded differently in this country. When I meet Prime Minister Starmer, I will have an opportunity to deal fundamentally with a range of issues although we cannot deal with every single issue. The UK has had challenges on both sides of the political spectrum in respect of protests and the nature of those protests.  I dealt with the points raised by Deputy Shane Moynihan about Operation Denton. The Sudan issue is one I have raised consistently with leaders, including publicly, at the G20 summit and at the Africa-European Union summit. It is catastrophic. It rarely gets mentioned in this House, but 12 million people have been displaced. Genocide against the civilian population is happening there. Some of the rebel forces are being supported by neighbouring countries with arms and so forth.  To respond to Deputy Conway-Walsh, the framework is Article 2 compliant. It is far stronger than its predecessor as a legacy Bill.  Deputy Murphy raised the new co-operation agreement. It absolutely makes sense that we co-operate very closely with the United Kingdom on the gas connectors, for example. Those are a huge security vulnerability for both the UK and Ireland, but particularly for Ireland. Within a week, our economy would come to a standstill if anything untoward were to happen to those interconnectors. I hope the Deputy would agree that we should have close defence co-operation for our economic security, in particular, and for our subsea cables. That will mean a lot of technological co-operation. When a Russian shadow fleet crosses over those pipes or subsea cables, very often divers have to go down and check that the pipes are okay. That is co-operation. Letting people know that somebody who might be up to not good is in your terrain is co-operation. Intelligence services sharing information about terrorists or potential attacks is co-operation. There should be no big deal about co-operation.  By the way, on the origin of our neutrality, it was not an anti-imperialist origin. In fact, at the consultative forum, there was a very good seminar on our neutrality and its origins. Obviously, the Second World War was at the core. We were neutral in not having issues with Britain and the occupation of Northern Ireland and so on, but the more fundamental issue was that it was a neutrality of survival. No one was in a position to defend Ireland in 1939, 1940 or 1941. There were good presentations made at that consultative forum but Deputy Murphy boycotted it because he felt it was not worthwhile. It would have been informative had he gone. It would have provided a more nuanced view----- \n Deputy Paul Murphy  It is a shame the Taoiseach scrapped the idea of a citizens' assembly. \n The Taoiseach  -----of the origins of our neutrality. \n An Ceann Comhairle  I thank the Taoiseach and ask him to move to the next question. \n The Taoiseach  I apologise. I thank the Ceann Comhairle for her tolerance. \n An Ceann Comhairle  It is not my tolerance. I get complaints at the Business Committee that this forum is not working. We are going to take it to the Dáil reform committee for change. ",

        "answerText": " The Taoiseach  I propose to take Questions Nos. 13 to 23, inclusive, together.  Regulation, and the extent of any regulatory or administrative burden, has recently become a greater focus at European Union level and nationally as a means to further enhance competitiveness. At a European level, both simplification and implementation are important Commission priorities. The Commission is striving to simplify and lighten the administrative burden of European Union regulations to ensure they are proportionate, stable, coherent and technologically neutral.  Likewise, our national regulatory framework is a central focus for the Government as we strive to support competitiveness at a time of international economic uncertainty. In line with the programme for Government, we published an action plan on competitiveness and productivity on 10 September this year. The action plan includes actions across government to ensure the development of a more effective regulatory system which will support economic growth.  These actions reflect priority areas where targeted public policy intervention can have the greatest impact. These include a red-tape challenge to reduce regulation for SMEs; the application of the SME test by Government Departments to all measures, in particular policy initiatives where it is proposed to increase costs on small businesses; expediting the Environmental (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill; commencing reforms, as we have done, under the Planning and Development Act 2024 to enhance delivery of infrastructure; and implementing the outstanding recommendations from the review of the administration of civil justice review group report.  Increased regulatory burden has also been identified as a barrier to infrastructure development and delivery. The Minister, Deputy Chambers, supported by the work of the accelerating infrastructure task force, this morning, with Government colleagues including me, the Tánaiste and the Minister of State, Deputy Harkin, published a plan which will include extensive regulatory reforms aimed at accelerating the delivery of critical infrastructure.  Today's plan provides the blueprint to reduce complexity and blockages in the system and deliver infrastructure with urgency. The changes we are initiating today are vital if we are to maintain our competitive position in an ever uncertain world. They are also necessary to support our citizens with top class public services, job security, access to housing and all other facilities necessary to enjoy the stability and good quality of life we are all entitled to expect.  The actions are ambitious but achievable, and delivering them will require commitment and co-operation across a broad and diverse range of stakeholders, from political, legal and public sectors, industry and society as a whole. We have established a cost-of-business advisory forum where business owners and representative bodies can speak directly to decision-makers about the real-world impact of regulations, fees and operational challenges. The work of that forum is under way. The Minister, Deputy McEntee, is working on the simplification omnibus packages put forward by the European Commission in a range of policy areas, most recently the Commission's digital simplification omnibus package, which was published last month.  My Department will play a co-ordinating role across these different regulatory reform initiatives, as outlined in the action plan on competitiveness and productivity, including the establishment of a central economic regulators' forum, and we will work with the Minister for Enterprise, Tourism and Employment and other Government colleagues on that agenda. \n Deputy Tony McCormack  I thank the Taoiseach for his response. I acknowledge the significant work he, the Minister, Deputy Chambers, and their two Departments are doing on infrastructure reform, particularly the steps being taken to modernise planning, reduce delays and ensure major projects move forward. Infrastructure reform is vital, but businesses and especially SMEs are also calling for a more streamlined regulatory environment. These firms consistently cite overlapping rules, slow approvals and heavy administrative demands as major obstacles to growth. Building on the work already happening on infrastructure, will the Taoiseach update the House on what specific measures his Department is pursuing to simplify compliance for SMEs, reduce unnecessary paperwork and make it easier for businesses to operate and expand? How will these reforms help to lower costs for employers and the taxpayer by making the system more efficient overall? \n Deputy Albert Dolan  It is vital that when we speak about regulatory reform, we talk about the administrative operations of existing systems in the function of the State. I will specifically reflect on the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland, SEAI, and the roll-out of grants. We are about to have a debate in this Chamber on energy costs. One thing that is vital is that the best way the Government can help to reduce energy costs in homes is to retrofit them for the future so that they simply do not need as much energy. That is the number one way to reduce the cost and it facilitates homes to be more efficient and takes pressure off the grid. The Government needs to do something to accelerate the rate at which homes can be retrofitted by the SEAI. For many constituents in my constituency, it is taking too long to get through the process of approval of the grant to construction. \n Deputy Ruairí Ó Murchú  We all accept there are huge issues with bureaucracy and red tape in planning. We should have seen simplification and streamlining. Conversations about this are occurring across Europe, but we know about the home-grown issues. It is an issue I have brought up previously, even within the planning systems involving State authorities. For example, Louth County Council is involved in the Ardee Education Together National School build and a particular issue has arisen. We do not have enough agility in the system. Multiple requests have gone in stating that there are not enough parking spaces. There are 21 spaces, including three disability spaces. There are only two set-down spaces for minibuses and there is a need for five as there are five autism spectrum disorder, ASD, classes and there is not even room for a full-size 52-seater bus to turn. There are 21 spaces for staff and there is a need for something closer to 40. \n An Ceann Comhairle  Thank you, Deputy. \n Deputy Ruairí Ó Murchú  It is possible to get this work done at this time, but if the works continue as planned, the problem will still need to be fixed but it could take more than €100,000, so we need something to be done. \n Deputy Darren O'Rourke  I raise the regulation of social media companies in the online space, particularly as it relates to children. The criticism that has been levelled at Coimisiún na Meán's online safety code is that an earlier draft had a recommendation that social media companies turn off recommender systems and it has been removed. Recommender systems profile people who are using apps and then drive them down often hateful and dangerous rabbit holes. It is not healthy for them or society. Will this be looked at? \n Deputy Ruth Coppinger  I raise regulatory reform of immigration and particularly family reunification. It is now being made much harder for many essential workers to be unified with their families, in particular migrant healthcare assistants who were brought over here on a visa programme and are working in private nursing homes. Last week on RTÉ radio, the Minister for justice was asked by the presenter whether these people are not entitled to a normal family life. They are caring for our older people and we have to show we care for them. The Minister's reply was that no one is forcing them to come here. That is absolutely heartless, shows zero empathy and is also completely counterproductive because many of them are nurses. They could go to other countries, but they have come to Ireland and are working below their grades or qualifications, giving huge added value to the nursing homes. I urge the Taoiseach to have a heart. We had a briefing here a few years ago, which Deputy Michael Healy-Rae attended because he knew the value of those healthcare assistants in nursing homes. These are essential workers and they will go elsewhere. \n An Ceann Comhairle  Thank you, Deputy. \n Deputy Ruth Coppinger  Please entitle them to have a normal family life. These mothers should not be separated from their kids. \n Deputy Paul Murphy  The programme for Government says the Government will move responsibility for the Multi-Unit Developments, MUD, Acts to the Department of housing from the Department of justice and establish a unit in the Housing Agency to regulate owners' management companies, OMCs, to ensure effective governance. That is important work that needs to happen. The problem is that it is not happening currently, but it has been agreed. Effectively what is holding it up is that, as a result of the Mulcreevy judgment, the primary legislation needs to be changed. At the moment, the MUD Act refers to the Minister for justice and not the Minister for housing. A simple amendment is needed to change the reference to the Minister for housing. Until that happens, all this work of regulatory oversight of OMCs and so on is simply not taking place. There was a meeting of the housing committee to discuss these issues. It invited various officials from the Department of housing and was told they could not come yet because their line Minister is not yet responsible for this. \n An Ceann Comhairle  Thank you, Deputy. \n Deputy Paul Murphy  The Housing Agency has not been allocated funding for doing any regulatory work as a result. This needs urgent action. \n Deputy Liam Quaide  There was a health committee session last week on the regulation of counselling and psychotherapy. In standards it has published, CORU has adopted a position that is entirely at odds with the main representative groups of those disciplines, which will reduce supervision requirements and remove mandatory personal therapy for trainees. These changes, if implemented, will degrade professional standards and undermine patient safety. CORU is showing a remarkable level of intransigence on these fundamentals of safe practice. Practitioners and representative bodies have warned that the proposals could also jeopardise recognition and mobility across the EU for counsellors and psychotherapists. We must protect high-quality training, preserve public confidence and ensure regulation strengthens, not weakens, these services.  I am not expressing some fringe opinion. The health committee was unanimous in supporting the counselling and psychotherapy representative groups and the session included some strong and insightful contributions from the Taoiseach's party colleagues, including Senator Costello. Will the Government immediately pause the CORU process, bring representative bodies and practitioners into full consultation and commit to reforms that prioritise client safety and high professional standards? \n Deputy Rose Conway-Walsh  I will talk about the regulation of quarries. The Taoiseach knows the price we have paid in this country and the price that families affected by the defective concrete blocks scandal have paid due to a lack of regulation.  Many of the homeowners I have spoken to in Mayo are not satisfied with the current regulations of quarries and in particular, that geologists are not examining the aggregate within the quarries that are being used to build homes now. I ask the Taoiseach to have a look at this area to see what can be done in that regard. It can be easily fixed by engaging and employing geologists to do the job and to make sure that people have confidence in the materials that are coming out of quarries. \n Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett  The Taxi Regulation Act 2013 clearly gives the Minister the power to impose regulations around the activities of dispatch companies. Today, for the third time in two weeks, taxi drivers in Dublin are protesting. There is a widespread protest against this across the country by taxi drivers over the behaviour of Uber, a multimillion euro company, that is trying to undermine the livelihood of nearly 20,000 taxi drivers by introducing a fixed fare system. This will undermine the regulated fare structure and therefore the livelihoods of taxi drivers and ultimately the industry itself. In the long run, as is clear from Uber's behaviour elsewhere in the world, it will not benefit the customer. Once the company gets hold of a market, fares and charges go up and the livelihoods of taxi drivers get smashed. Will the Taoiseach ask the Minister for Transport to impose such regulations to prevent Uber destroying the industry and livelihoods of taxi drivers around this fixed fare system and enforce the taxi regulation and meter stuff? \n The Taoiseach  Deputy McCormack raised infrastructure reform, particularly for small to medium-sized businesses. Some of the measures we have taken in respect of deferring the alignment of the minimum wage with the national living wage will help to avoid the escalation of costs because the SME sector has borne the brunt of a lot of additional costs over the past five years. There is no doubt the reduction in VAT on hospitality will help a lot of SMEs in the hospitality sector and hairdressing as well. The number of sick days leave is going to be quickly expanded. We have expanded it to three days. The cumulative cost of everything has been fairly excessive. The Small Business Forum is there to try to balance imposition on small business as well as the cost.  The other issue is the sequential approach to planning and regulations as opposed to a concurrent approach whereby instead of waiting for the planning to be done, agencies do the procurement. Instead of waiting for environmental assessments, doing them all in parallel would speed up a lot of activity. In many instances, we are constantly looking at the avoidance of increased cost for SMEs and trying to slow down the increased costs that have come their way. It is interesting the rate of youth employment has crept up in the past six to nine months. I believe that is related to costs on SMEs.  Deputy Dolan is correct that retrofitting is the most effective way to reduce costs. Between 2019 and September 2025, the Government provided over €1.5 billion in support to homeowners for over 228,000 upgrades, including 30,000 fully funded retrofits under the warmer homes scheme. It is estimated that if a deep retrofit is done, it can save a household up to €1,100 per year in energy costs. I get the Deputy's point that the administration of it needs to be faster. There is also resource demand in respect of it as well with some people not being able to afford to do retrofits because of the cost.  On Deputy Ó Murchú's issue, I do not have the specifics on Ardee Educate Together National School. I do not know what the interaction with the county council is, but in any event----- \n Deputy Ruairí Ó Murchú  The refusal to change----- \n The Taoiseach  They should sort it out. A school is an important facility. The county council should be facilitative in the building of a school. \n Deputy Ruairí Ó Murchú  It is not just the council. \n The Taoiseach  Deputy O'Rourke raised regulation online. We have now established the regulatory framework governing online. There is ongoing review in respect of it. Children must be protected. That has to be the optimal.  Deputy Coppinger raised healthcare assistants and family reunification. We have significant reunification in Ireland under our migration system, in particular when people leave direct provision who have residency. The Minister will bring forward legislation in respect of this and these are issues we can discuss in greater detail at that stage.  On Deputy Murphy's point, I will talk to the Ministers responsible. There has to be proper regulation of management companies. There are fundamental rights involved in terms of those complexes. I will pursue that with the Minister and see where we are in terms of amendment to primary legislation.  Deputy Quaide raised the issue of counselling and psychotherapy. On qualification frameworks and regulators generally, we want more therapists, but they have to be highly qualified. Public health is number one and the protection of the consumer. In some instances, they can be quite protectionist as well. The judgment called for regulators and I would like CORU to get the judgment right in terms of not having the bar so high that there are only highly qualified, and others are not. That is not just in terms of therapy and counselling; that is in terms of teaching and a range of other issues.  Deputy Conway-Walsh raised the regulation of quarries. I will talk to the Minister involved in that. We can overregulate too but I take the Deputy's point about the quality of aggregate and quality of the product. There are existing systems to deal with that. The SEAI is there. There are various regulatory bodies to deal with the quality of materials, but I will talk to the Minister in respect of that. New bodies were set up after the defective blocks scheme.  Deputy Boyd Barrett raised taxi regulation. I will talk to the Minister about the issues that the Deputy raised. There is a balance between consumers, those availing of taxis and the regulation of same. We had regulation a long time ago; it did not work. There was always an imbalance between supply and demand. I will look at this and will talk to the Minister for Transport in respect of it. He is fully aware of it. \n An Ceann Comhairle  We have a delegation of students visiting from Ukraine as our part of our EPAS programme hosted by Maynooth Post Primary School. They are most welcome. We had their president here yesterday, which we enjoyed immensely. ",

In accordance with this legislation where the bereavement of a qualified cohabitant occurred prior 22 January 2024, payment will be made from the date of judgment. Where the bereavement of a qualified cohabitant occurred after the date of the judgment and before the enactment of the legislation, payment will be back-dated to the date of death.

        "answerText": " Deputy Ruairí Ó Murchú  Go raibh maith agat. I ask the Minister to provide an update on any engagement at EU level on the EU-Israel agreement. We all know the humanitarian conditions that unfortunately have never been employed. We know what Israel has done. We know that maximum pressure and leverage need to be applied. We know that is probably the only reason we have a peace plan, if we can call it that, at this point in time.  I would also like to get an update, and I understand the Minister did speak about this earlier, in relation to the Israeli settlements in the occupied Palestinian territory (prohibition of importation of goods) Bill. Again, however, it is not much good unless we do the job properly and that it happens quickly, with services included as well. \n Deputy Helen McEntee  I thank the Deputy for the question. On 14 February 2024, the then Taoiseach, along with Prime Minister Sánchez of Spain, wrote to the President of the European Commission requesting an urgent review of whether Israel was complying with its humanitarian rights obligations under the EU-Israel Association Agreement. Furthermore, the letter requested that the Commission propose appropriate measures for the consideration of the Council, should it find that Israel was in breach of its obligations.  A review of the EU-Israel Association Agreement, initiated by the Foreign Affairs Council in May 2025, found that actions taken by the Israeli Government represented a breach of essential elements relating to respect for human rights and democratic principles. The European Commission subsequently put forward a number of proposals, one of which was to suspend the core trade-related provisions of the Association Agreement. Ireland has welcomed the Commission proposals and encouraged other member states to support them. Notwithstanding the positive and welcome recent developments with regard to a ceasefire and hostage release deal in Gaza, Ireland along with other member states, has made clear our view that the proposals should remain on the table. In her state of the Union address, the President of the European Commission was clear on the rationale for tabling the package, which remains valid, as we discussed last week.  The Government has always been of the view that the EU-Israel Association Agreement must be interpreted and applied in accordance with the obligations of the EU and its Member States under international law. In June, the Government approved the general scheme of the Israeli settlements in the occupied Palestinian territory (prohibition of importation of goods) Bill. The main purpose of the Bill is to prohibit the importation of goods into the State from Israeli settlements in the occupied Palestinian territory, including East Jerusalem. It remains the Government’s preference that collective action would be taken at EU level and we continue to pursue this. At the EU level, the primary objective right now is ensuring the success of what is a very fragile ceasefire and peace deal.  In addition, the Tánaiste, in his capacity as the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, wrote to High Representative Kallas in advance of the June Foreign Affairs Council to ask how the Commission assesses the impact on the EU-Israel Association Agreement of the International Court of Justice, ICJ, advisory opinion of July 2024. The High Representative responded to his letter on 17 October, indicating the Commission’s view that the EU’s current approach is in line with the spirit and letter of the ICJ advisory opinion. Our assessment is different, so we are currently studying the detail of the response provided by the High Representative and considering next steps. \n Deputy Ruairí Ó Murchú  Go raibh maith agat, agus comhghairdeachas leis an Aire ar a post nua. Straightaway, we can all see there were particular issues in relation to the EU-Israel Association Agreement, and not only in the sense of the particular deal that was really sweet from the Israeli point of view. We talk of these humanitarian conditions but obviously there was absolutely no power in relation to enforcement. Unfortunately, there was also a lack of will across the European Union. I welcome that we and others have pushed in relation to this matter. I do not think it is an issue we can let slide.  While we have a peace plan, it is a peace plan in which Palestinians will suffer. We have seen that the Israeli regime is absolutely determined to ensure there is no two-state solution. As much as we need to push the EU, we also have to do the work we can do ourselves. Even though it is not everything, it would be good if we could publish the Attorney General's advice, so we could end that particular argument. We really need to see the occupied territories Bill enforced in full. As much as it might not have the impact that people talk about, in terms of it not having an absolutely spectacular impact, it is part of what Spain and Slovenia are doing, and it is similar to what happened with South Africa. I doubt that the action of the Dunnes Stores workers had a real financial impact but it was part of something wider and it made a huge difference in the long term. We need to be part of doing this. \n Deputy Helen McEntee  I thank the Deputy. I do acknowledge that other colleagues have made progress in terms of implementing legislation. Some of it did not have to happen in the same way that we have to progress our legislation. I stress also that it happened prior to the ceasefire. I think what is really important and what our focus and priority need to be on, not just at home but at an EU level and internationally, is making sure that ceasefire holds. It is very clear breaches are occurring. It is very clear more humanitarian aid needs to be let through. This is why it is absolutely essential that in the context of the EU-Israel Association Agreement, the proposal that has been put on the table that would remove those preferential tariffs remains on the table. Ireland is the country that pushed for and initiated that process. I again reiterated the need for it to remain on the table at the Council meeting.  I will not lie. There are other member states and individuals who think we should take it off the table and that that would allow for further progress to be made. While there continue to be persistent breaches of the ceasefire by Israel, however, we need to make sure that every lever available to us is very firmly on the table.  In terms of the legislation, again I have given a very clear commitment that we will uphold our programme for Government commitment that we will progress it. I am waiting on further information and advice, and once I have that, we will be able to make further progress. \n Deputy Ruairí Ó Murchú  Not only do we need the maintenance of the ceasefire and to make sure there are no breaches but we also have to maintain whatever leverage we and the wider international community can on Israel. At this moment, we are somewhat glad it is not engaged in genocidal action but let us be absolutely clear it is determined, at least the regime at this point is, to make sure nobody can deliver justice, freedom, self-determination for the Palestinian people and a two-state solution. The fact is this is one of the few things we can do. We need to make sure we maintain whatever pressure we can. The EU-Israel Association Agreement is a blemish and a further disgrace in relation to how the European Union has dealt with this whole genocidal nightmare for the Palestinians.  Equally, we need to move on the occupied territories Bill. It is the one thing we can do.  We need to end this argument in relation to legal matters. As I said, it is about the fact that we are doing this alongside others. This will have an impact. The reason there is a peace plan is that even Donald Trump did not like the idea of what the Israelis were doing, and the killing children and innocent people. \n Deputy Helen McEntee  We need to acknowledge and look to the fact that the peace plan, although a lot of work still needs to be done, made reference to a pathway for a two-state solution. That is something Ireland has consistently called for and supports and that many other member states are now supporting. It is something we need to work towards in making sure we have a pathway towards a two-state solution. First and foremost, our priority needs to be ensuring the ceasefire, which is extremely fragile, can hold and that the thousands of malnourished and starving children and citizens more broadly who need aid get access to that aid, and that we ensure that what the Palestinian Authority needs to rebuild Gaza can be provided to it. At the meeting we had only recently, the first meeting of the Palestinian Authority with member states as well as countries in the Middle East and beyond, I restated Ireland's call for Israel to release over €3 billion of funds it is withholding in taxes. That would go a long way towards helping to start rebuilding, whether it is investment in hospitals and schools or shelter for those who need it most, particularly coming into what is going to be a cold winter period.

At this critical juncture for Ukraine, after almost 4 years of brutal Russian aggression, I want to emphasise Ireland’s unequivocal and continuing support and solidarity with Ukraine.  I am deeply concerned about the worsening situation on the ground in Ukraine. Russia’s continuing attacks targeting civilian areas and the devastating loss of life this week are harrowing. Russia’s actions are not those of a country seeking peace.  I attended the meeting of the Foreign Affairs Council on 20 November where Ukraine’s Foreign Minister Sybiha spoke about recent Russian attacks against Ukraine. I also attended by video conference a further meeting of the Council on 26 November.  I welcome  President Trump's efforts for peace, his commitment to Ukraine's sovereignty, and his willingness to provide substantial security guarantees for Ukraine  It is more important than ever that Europe and the United States continue to work together to achieve this. This is in our joint interest.  The emerging US proposals as well as plans for further negotiations represent a step forward.  It is crucial that any agreement upholds Ukraine’s sovereignty and territorial integrity based on respect for the principles of the UN Charter and for international law. The fundamental principle that borders cannot be changed by force must be upheld.  Any agreement must also protect Ukraine and Europe’s vital security. That means strong, credible guarantees that ensure Ukraine can defend its sovereignty and territorial integrity to avoid a repetition of the past.  This is not just vital for Ukraine - it is also vital for the European Union and all its Member States, including Ireland.  The Taoiseach and I remain in close contact with our European and Ukrainian partners. The Taoiseach took part in a meeting the European Council on 24 November and attended a meeting of the leaders of the “Coalition of the Willing” on 25 November.  We remain steadfast in our support for a just and lasting peace and security for the people of Ukraine throughout the period ahead. ",

        "answerText": " Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine  Reports of the Farmers Journal investigation into the sale of hormones and antibiotics in Brazil raise important issues and merit careful examination.  We know that Brazilian beef already enters the EU market, and it is therefore important to ensure that none of the unregulated products referenced in the investigation are used in its production. While there is no evidence that this is the case, these reports reinforce the need for continued vigilance.  According to Central Statistics Office data for the last number of years, Ireland has not imported beef product in any significant quantities from Brazil. In 2024, imports from Brazil amounted to 97 tonnes of a total of 34,000 tonnes imported. Beef imports from other Mercosur countries was virtually nil.  The EU has very stringent standards, known as SPS (sanitary and phytosanitary) standards, to protect human, animal and plant health. These are amongst the highest in the world, and the European Commission has insisted that they are not negotiable. These SPS standards remain unaltered regardless of any trade agreements concluded by the EU.  The Government is very firmly of the view that these EU SPS standards must continue to be rigorously upheld for the benefit of European consumers. It is also important that the European Commission continues to engage with the Brazilian authorities to ensure that this is the case.  Throughout the EU-Mercosur negotiation process, the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade - who has lead responsibility for trade policy - and I have actively engaged with both the European Commission and with other Member States to voice Ireland’s concerns in relation to the EU-Mercosur Agreement.  Since my appointment as Minister earlier this year, I have raised these concerns at Agri-Fish Council meetings and also with like-minded Member States through bilateral meetings on the margins of these Council meetings. In recent months, I have met with my French, Austrian, Latvian and Polish counterparts to exchange views. Most recently, I have met with my Italian and French counterparts en marge of the November Agri-Fish Council meeting in Brussels. ",

At the EU Nitrates Committee meeting last December, my Department advised that in accordance with the Nitrates Directive, Ireland is seeking permission to continue applying in excess of 170 kg of livestock manure Nitrogen per hectare from 2026 subject to a set of conditions that will ensure that application is scientifically justified and will continue to contribute to the achievement of the Nitrates Directive’s objectives.  Since last December Ireland has made a number of presentations to the EU Nitrates Committee and there has been very significant engagement at a European level.  The Environmental Protection Agency or EPA presented on Irish water quality at the Nitrates Committee meeting in March.  In June my Department presented on Irish agriculture in a European context, the justification for our derogation, and the changes introduced during Ireland’s current Nitrates Action Programme or NAP.  At the September meeting of the Committee my Department, along with the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage, presented on the background to Ireland’s next NAP and our derogation request, as well as proposed measures that are now under public consultation regarding the next NAP.  All these presentations were well received by the Committee.  In June, the Commission wrote to Ireland regarding the need to demonstrate compliance with the Habitats Directive in addition to the need to meet the objectives set under the Water Framework Directive. This change has significant implications. The Government has engaged significantly with the Commission and stakeholders in response.  As part of this, I recently welcomed Commissioner Roswall to Ireland where she witnessed our unique grass-based system and the on-going work across the agrifood sector to reduce its impact on water quality. The visit included a very positive visit to a derogation farm in Kildare. The Commissioner also met farm organisations, eNGO’s, Oireachtas members, MEP’s and officials.  Engagement is on-going with the intention of securing the necessary qualified majority vote on Ireland’s derogation at the Nitrates Committee.  A qualified majority vote requires at least 15 Member States, representing at least 65% of the EU population to support a proposal brought forward by the Commission.  The priority for this government is both to retain the nitrates derogation and to improve water quality. I remain confident regarding achievement of these twin objectives. ",

        "answerText": " An Ceann Comhairle  We have 15 to 16 minutes left. There are 20 Deputies to speak on the next question. I propose to divide the time remaining after the Taoiseach's opening statement between a number of Deputies. \n The Taoiseach  It is a brilliant statement. \n An Ceann Comhairle  The Taoiseach will have to try to be brief. \n The Taoiseach  I jest. \n Deputy Peadar Tóibín  It is all in the delivery. \n The Taoiseach  I will try to cut it short to allow others to come in. I propose to take Questions Nos. 14 to 35, inclusive, together.  I established the disability unit in the Department to bring about a renewed focus and urgency and out of a desire to drive progress on disability issues. The unit's first programme plan, published in September, outlines how the unit will drive the delivery of the Government's new national disability strategy, working across government to make the ambitions a reality. In particular, the unit will look to drive innovation, to get things done, to bring momentum to policy implementation, to troubleshoot, where appropriate, to improve the delivery of services, and to get strategic thinking on future challenges. The unit will also support the Cabinet committee on disability.  The first programme plan for the unit outlines ten priority areas for the period from 2025 to 2027 across five workstreams. The first workstream relates to transforming children's disability services, early years education and health. The second is about increasing system capacity and the third is about opening doors and addressing barriers to employment pathways and supports. The fourth relates to implementing the national disability strategy and the fifth is on planning and designing for the future. The programme plan allows for further workstreams to be assigned to the unit as may be needed.  We do not want to duplicate the work of Ministers or Departments but to support them in improving services and getting things done. It is already up and running. The Cabinet committee on disability has met five times to date. With the support of the unit, we have looked at the new national disability strategy. As the House will know, that has gone through and has now been published. The provision of therapists in special schools is up and running. Some €16 million has been allocated for that this year. There have also been improvements to the delivery of services and the assessment of need process is being reformed, which includes legislative reform.  The budget was impacted by the unit and the Cabinet subcommittee and there was a significant focus on disability, particularly the income disregards for carer's allowance, among other initiatives and payments. The budget also provided a record €3.8 billion allocation towards specialist disability services. This represents a 20% increase year on year. That is to provide permanent dedicated funding for essential disability services. The investment in children's disability services will provide therapy services and strengthen the children's disability network teams through the provision of additional staff and so forth. Some €20 million was targeted at the assessment of need waitlist initiative, providing up to 6,500 clinical assessments. We are developing our budget spotlight on disability. That will be published in due course. It relates to the last budget but will also provide further thinking with regard to future budgets. We are also looking at developments in the area of transport and mobility. We are awaiting proposals from the Departments of Transport and Finance in that regard. \n An Ceann Comhairle  I propose to take the first six Deputies and to allow the Taoiseach six minutes to respond. \n Deputy Pádraig O'Sullivan  This is a topic the Taoiseach is very familiar with. He has visited the Rainbow Club on dozens of occasions at this stage and knows the great work that Jon, Karen and the board do. When Senator Rabbitte was the Minister of State, she was the first to allocate funding to the Rainbow Club under a service level agreement to provide respite care for children. As the Taoiseach will know, every week, over 1,200 children avail of this service, which is provided on a shoestring budget. The Taoiseach will be very familiar with the difficulties the club had in acquiring a nearby site, the former HSE ambulance building. It now has that building and has been lucky enough to engage an architect who is a professional in this field pro bono to design a bespoke building that is fit for the club's purposes. We need to move this project on. We need the HSE and the Government to support it financially to deliver it. It is going to be a massive undertaking for the charity. What is the Taoiseach's office going to do to advance the project? \n Deputy Ruairí Ó Murchú  The National Human Rights Strategy for Disabled People 2025-2030 was launched with great fanfare but we await the action plan. There is much talk of accountability. Will the Taoiseach give me a timeline for the introduction of that action plan? Who will be taking the lead, particularly with regard to oversight and accountability? Will it be the unit, the Cabinet committee or the Department of Children, Disability and Equality? How exactly will it work? How will we see improvements, whether in relation to assessments and therapies or the low level of disabled people who are involved in employment and the need for schemes that actually work? A lot of work is needed to make schemes such as the wage subsidy scheme and the work and access programme fit for purpose. \n Deputy Cian O'Callaghan  The level of unemployment among disabled people in Ireland is among the worst in Europe. I recently met with a number of disabled people in my constituency who have excellent qualifications and skills and who are willing and eager to work but who are stuck in unemployment. There are a number of barriers to employment that need to be removed. We are far behind other European countries in this regard. In 2021, the OECD released a report that made a number of recommendations as to how to tackle this. Those recommendations have still not been implemented. When will they be implemented in full?  What is the Government doing to tackle the scandalously high unemployment levels for disabled people in Ireland? \n Deputy Barry Heneghan  Bhí mé ag caint faoi seo dhá sheachtain ó shin agus an tseachtain seo caite. An rud atá i gceist ná Stapolin Educate Together National School in Baldoyle, which has a petition. Children from the school were in the Dáil last week. It needs two autism classrooms to be sanctioned by the Minister. There are eight children in mainstream classes with eligibility letters and a further 30 in the catchment area who are on waiting lists. This is a huge priority for me and I would love it to be addressed. \n Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett  David and Nicole have a five-year-old son with autism, and an older son. They live in a maisonette, which is 29 sq. m. It is absolutely tiny and rank with damp. Because of his autism, their son has serious sensory processing issues. He is a flight risk. I know these flats well. They have very dangerous concrete steps, which are a serious risk to him. Occupational therapists, medical professionals and people in school have said that he has to be got out of there as he cannot develop or do his occupational therapy if he is living in these conditions. Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council says autism is too prevalent in the community to give it medical priority. That is outrageous. The prevalence of a condition is not a reason to say it is not a priority if the child is in danger. If a child is in danger, it is a priority to get the child out of danger. \n An Ceann Comhairle  I appreciate that. The Taoiseach has the message. \n Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett  I would like there to be an intervention on that. \n Deputy Paul Murphy  The budget was a savage attack on disabled people. It took over €1,000 out of the pockets of disabled people and betrayed the promise in the programme for Government to introduce a permanent annual cost-of-disability support payment. The last time I asked about this, the Taoiseach claimed the cost of disability would be looked at in the next budget. The cost-of-living crisis is now. The cost-of-disability crisis is now. Some 70,000 people who are disabled or have a long-term illness are living in poverty. That is one in three. I have been inundated with emails from disabled people asking for winter cost-of-living and cost-of-disability payment. Many will be forced to choose between heating and eating this Christmas. They also want a permanent cost-of-disability payment without further delay. The Taoiseach has billions of euro in surplus. Do not be a Scrooge this Christmas. Please act on it. \n Deputy Peadar Tóibín  The children's disability network team, CDNT, in Meath is not fully staffed. According to statistics I received today, there are 20 vacant posts across disability teams in Kells, Dunshaughlin, Navan, Slane and Trim. Separate data received by Aontú today show that the Government is actually reducing the number of college places for speech and language therapists, from 370 in the year before Covid to 355 last year. The Government is reducing the number of students filling the necessary college places on an annual basis. What is the Taoiseach saying to parents whose children have been waiting for 14 months to see the CDNT in County Meath and to the children who are being bounced around endlessly from CAMHS, the CDNTs and other services? \n An Ceann Comhairle  Before the Taoiseach replies, could he maybe answer the other Deputies in writing?  Sixteen Deputies did not get to ask questions. They might get some form of response from the Taoiseach. \n The Taoiseach  You can bring some more of them in if you want, a Cheann Comhairle. \n An Ceann Comhairle  Only if the Taoiseach needs less time. We cannot go over the 45 minutes provided. \n The Taoiseach  I am not going to write replies to oral questions. I have given an overall response to everybody. \n An Ceann Comhairle  I am bound by the timelines set down. \n The Taoiseach  Do I have six minutes remaining? \n An Ceann Comhairle  Yes. \n The Taoiseach  I will get around to everybody who has asked a question. \n An Ceann Comhairle  I am talking about the Deputies who have not have not got in. \n Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett  The Taoiseach cannot really answer questions that have not been asked. \n An Ceann Comhairle  I know, but that is it. \n The Taoiseach  It is a new departure if I am going to do a written reply to every oral question. That is not on either. \n An Ceann Comhairle  The Taoiseach should go ahead. I suppose it is just a casualty of how interruptions affect the course of questions. To be fair, the Taoiseach cannot answer a question that has not been asked. We are delaying the answering process. \n Deputy Jennifer Whitmore  Could we even have 30 seconds to ask a question and then maybe the Taoiseach could respond? \n An Ceann Comhairle  No. We cannot go over time. I do not set the time. I do not have that discretion. \n Deputy Jennifer Whitmore  No, but we could stay within the time. \n An Ceann Comhairle  There are 15 Deputies left. \n The Taoiseach  Deputy Pádraig O'Sullivan raised the Rainbow Club, which is doing exceptional work. Jon and Karen O'Mahony have been exceptional leaders in that regard. The former Minister of State, now Senator Rabbitte, did good work on a service level agreement. I was involved in advocating for that building, which was a HSE building, to be allocated to the Rainbow Club. I will certainly continue to work with them and to support them with capital. What is important is that we get a timeline and some idea of how we can progress that as quickly as we possibly can. It is a very good, practical example of how a parent-led, community-based approach can develop services for autism in a nimble and flexible way that has helped so many families.  Deputy Ó Murchú asked about the action plan. That will come.  I do not have an exact date but it is on target. It is fairly imminent. \n Deputy Ruairí Ó Murchú  Who will lead on it? \n An Ceann Comhairle  Please, Deputy Ó Murchú. \n The Taoiseach  The Minister, Deputy Foley, will lead, with the support of the unit in my office, but she will also report to the Cabinet subcommittee, which will then make recommendations to the Cabinet. That is how this will work. The Cabinet subcommittee is very important because all the key Ministers have to be there.  I agree with Deputy Cian O'Callaghan that the unemployment levels among the disability community is too high, and the barriers are too much. Part of the strategy in terms of what I am trying to do with the Minister, Deputy Calleary, is to remove some of those barriers and to create additional supports to make sure that employers are even more incentivised to recruit people. The intention is also to give supports to those who employ people with disabilities on a more sustainable basis. I do not disagree with the Deputy. The historic underemployment of people with disabilities in society is something that is exercising me.  I will pursue the issue raised by Deputy Heneghan about the two autism classes in the Educate Together school in Baldoyle.  I agree with Deputy Boyd Barrett. That is a very strange response from the council referring to the prevalence of autism. Autism is a spectrum, a continuum. There is high-functioning autism, people in the middle and those with autism which is very severe and profound. The council should be able to use the general guidelines in respect of health needs more generally. I am at a loss as to why the council cannot say in this case that the child needs prioritisation and a proper house to facilitate the treatment and life of the child. That is something on which I will go back to the Minister for housing in respect of guidelines to be sent to councils in that respect. I would not have thought it necessary. I thought councils would have enough flexibility to do this.  I disagree with Deputy Paul Murphy's description of the budget as a savage attack, but €3 billion has been invested in special education as an outcome of the budget, as well as €130 million for grants to adapt the houses of older people and disabled people. There was a €10 increase per week in the disability allowance, an expansion of the wage subsidy scheme, an increase of €375 in the income limit for carer's benefit, and a €20 increase in the monthly domiciliary care allowance. That is not a savage attack on disability. We have to pursue the cost of disability and the Minister will bring plans in the next budget in respect of that.  In response to Deputy Tóibín, the vacancy rate nationally has come down for CDNTs. We have increased the allocation of therapy places in third level colleges. \n An Ceann Comhairle  I thank the Taoiseach. Even though there is time left, the point is that this format is not working. The place to discuss that is at the Business Committee on Thursday. I ask Members to bring it up and we can sort out something else. Certainly, where there is a grouping of 19 Members, it is not possible to give the Taoiseach time to answer in the remaining time. I am sorry for those who did not get in but there is just nothing we can do, other than discuss it at the Business Committee and change the format. ",

        "answerText": " An Cathaoirleach Gníomhach (Deputy Pádraig O'Sullivan)  Tá Ceist Uimh. 7, in ainm an Teachta Peter 'Chap' Cleere, á thogáil arís ag an Teachta Séamus McGrath. \n Deputy Kieran O'Donnell  The Deputy is keeping us busy tonight. \n Deputy Séamus McGrath  Will the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage outline the key measures to increase the use of modern methods of construction under Delivering Homes, Building Communities 2025-2030 and make a statement on the matter? \n Deputy James Browne  I again thank Deputy Séamus McGrath for asking this question on behalf of Deputy Peter 'Chap' Cleere. I propose to take Questions Nos. 7, 64 and 99 together.  The new national housing plan contains a range of actions to increase skills and support modern methods of construction, building on the initiatives already in place. MMC is the term used to describe a range of compliant innovative construction alternatives to traditional construction methods. MMC has the potential to boost productivity, increase efficiency and improve sustainability in the construction sector. It has brought tangible benefits to housing delivery. Reductions in delivery timeframes of up to 40%, greater cost certainty and reduced changes during construction have offered both cost and time savings.  My Department is working closely with the Department of Enterprise, Tourism and Employment, the Department of Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science and other relevant stakeholders in progressing work to increase delivery capacity in the residential construction sector through promoting the adoption of modern methods of construction.  Key actions which are included in delivering homes, building communities to increase adoption of MMC are: the use of MMC in at least 25% of all new social and affordable homes built during the lifetime of the plan; support for the use of three-dimensional modular units through pathfinder projects in Limerick and Wexford; optimising the NSAI agrément certification process; promotion of ISIF funding opportunities for manufacturers to support new and existing factories; the delivery of at least 1,500 MMC dwellings through the local authority accelerated delivery programme; renewing the action plan to promote careers in construction and launching a new five-year action plan for apprenticeships; and doubling the overall investment of Enterprise Ireland’s build to innovate programme to drive adoption of efficient construction practices and the use of MMC.  My Department has also recently published the standardised design approaches study.  These standardised design approaches will raise awareness about the benefits and opportunities and promote adoption, of standardised housing design to facilitate MMC. \n Deputy Séamus McGrath  I welcome the strong recognition for modern methods of construction in the new housing plan. That is critically important. The construction sector is very much up for embracing MMC and the additional measures in the plan to incentivise the construction industry to take up those measures are critically important. The Cathaoirleach Gníomhach will know a development in his constituency, Longview in Ballyvolane, where the developers are very much embracing both on-site and off-site modern methods of construction and really delivering quickly in terms of the turnaround time for new houses. That is important and it was a site the Taoiseach visited recently to see first-hand the progress that has been made there. I totally agree that this has the potential to be a more environmental form of construction and increase sustainability but also provide new employment opportunities for individuals as well in the area of modern methods of construction. Furthermore, it does, of course, help us weatherproof some of the delivery in terms of construction so that it can move apace during the winter months, which is one of the key advantages of MMC. \n Deputy James Browne  I thank the Deputy for the important question on MMC. A dissemination programme is currently being developed by my Department and the Department of Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science to promote the use of these approaches in the education and construction sectors. These standardised designs build on my Department's existing design manual for quality housing, for example, for social housing and the LDA's Apartment Typology Booklet, which also include designs to promote the use of MMC for social housing and apartments. In addition, my Department's accelerated delivery programme supports the development of new social homes using MMC. The delivery of at least 1,500 new homes across a total of 36 sites and 13 local authorities has been prioritised and enabled through the use of a streamlined design and build procurement approach that facilitates MMC. Approximately 1,250 homes are being constructed using this procurement approach. The Government is committed to supporting all forms of MMC to encourage greater innovation in construction. The 2D approaches using panelised systems are quite widespread, with 3D volumetric approaches still in a more embryonic phase. \n Deputy Séamus McGrath  I strongly believe the construction sector is onboard for modern methods of construction. It recognises the advantages, cost savings and that it can deliver with greater efficiency, which is critically important. It is also important the Government is leading in this way in the provision in the plan for 25% of social and affordable units to be delivered through MMC. That message is very important. Indeed, other measures such as build to innovate by the Department of enterprise is also very important to help promote MMC. It is a sector that will continue to grow in this country. It can provide employment opportunities and use more sustainable materials as part of that, which is critically important from an environmental point of view, as well as delivering homes in a more speedy and efficient manner. \n Deputy James Browne  We will support a number of 3D volumetric pathfinder projects to further explore the potential for these innovative systems. Using MMC, Limerick City and County Council and the mayor’s office will be supported to advance the initial phase of their SMART modular housing project. In addition, Wexford County Council is being supported to commence a project to develop 22 permanent social homes utilising 3D volumetric systems. We will continue to maximise the use of 2D right across our systems due to its importance. ",

        "answerText": " Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage  I propose to take Questions Nos. 33, 77 and 503 together.  My Department provides funding under the suite of Housing Adaptation Grants for Older People and Disabled People, to assist those in private houses to make their accommodation more suitable for their needs. The suite of grants, which include the Housing Adaptation Grant for Disabled People, the Mobility Aids Grant and the Housing Aid for Older People Grant, are funded by my Department with a contribution from the local authority. The detailed administration of the scheme including assessment, approval, prioritisation and apportionment is the responsibility of local authorities.  Details of initial annual allocations and subsequent local authority drawdown for 2024, including where additional funding had been sanctioned or where allocations have been underspent, can be found on my Department's website at the following link:  www.gov.ie/en/department-of-housing-local-government-and-heritage/collections/other-local-authority-housing-scheme-statistics/  The Exchequer funding available for these grants in 2025 has been increased substantially by €25 million to €99.5 million, or over €117 million when accounting for the local authority contribution.  My Department works closely with local authorities to monitor spend and to achieve a full drawdown of available funding. This means that any underspends that arise on the part of any local authority can be redistributed to other authorities which have high levels of grant activity and my Department makes every effort to redistribute such funding throughout the year.  To date, almost €5.7 million in estimated underspends has been redistributed to 11 local authorities, who have requested additional funding for 2025, and the information is set out in the following table:     Local Authority    2025 Exchequer Allocation    Additional Funding Approved      Cavan    €1,862,107    €1,238,554      Clare    €2,699,530    €285,000      Donegal    €3,770,067    €1,500,000      Laois    €1,861,224    €177,251      Limerick City & County    €4,390,272    €592,511      Louth    €2,698,187    €150,000      Monaghan    €1,625,241    €425,000      Offaly    €1,846,196    €170,000      Sligo    €1,786,976    €453,670      Tipperary    €3,560,739    €425,000      Westmeath    €2,044,571    €275,935      Total:        €5,692,922     My Department continues to process funding claims in respect of the 2025 budget and full details in respect of local authorities not fully expending their 2025 allocation will be available in early 2026.

It is expected that 36,500 local authority owned homes will be retrofitted under this programme between 2021 to 2030 inclusive.  Annual targets and the funding provided under the EERP are subject to the funding available through the annual Estimates process in any given year. The 2025 EERP is providing €90m to local authorities to retrofit approximately 2,500 local authority owned homes, with the selection of homes and nature of works for inclusion in the programme a matter for each individual local authority.  Through Budget 2026 the Government has provided very significant additional funding for housing and this is expected to result in a big increase in the funding available for retrofitting of LA homes in 2026. The final allocation for 2026 will be determined as part of the REV which will be published shortly. Local authorities will receive their individual allocations early in Q1 2026. In the meantime, and to keep this important work going in advance of formal allocations issuing, correspondence will issue shortly notifying local authorities that they can commit to works for 2026 up to a maximum of 65% of their 2025 allocation.

Deputy Ruairí Ó Murchú asked the Minister for Culture, Communications and Sport the engagement his Department has had with organisations (details supplied) or any other stakeholders following the publication of concerns regarding the welfare of athletes in the high performance programmes at one of the organisations; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

        "answerText": " Deputy Ruairí Ó Murchú  I ask the Minister the engagement his Department has had with organisations, in particular Rowing Ireland, or any other stakeholders, following the publication of concerns regarding the welfare of athletes in the high performance programmes. In fairness, we have all seen it - anybody who has read Paul Kimmage or heard any of the podcasts he has dealt with. It is frightening. We have seen the huge success there has been in rowing and we would like to make sure these particular issues are addressed. \n Deputy Charlie McConalogue  First, and as I have previously and consistently said, it is imperative that it is made clear that there is simply no place for abuse of any kind in sport and that there is zero tolerance for any actions that endanger welfare, whether for participants, staff or those who work for and support sports across the country.  Sport Ireland, which is funded by my Department, works with national governing bodies of sport, NGBs, to ensure that appropriate policies are put in place to take a proactive approach to safeguarding by identifying and mitigating risks to athlete welfare. It also works with national governing bodies to ensure mechanisms are in place to appropriately react to and handle complaints or issues when they arise.  Sport Ireland has informed my Department that when alerted to athlete welfare concerns within the sport in question, it reacted sympathetically, promptly and robustly to the issues within the context of its own statutory remit.  Rowing Ireland, in consultation with Sport Ireland, undertook an independent review after the 2024 Paris Olympics and this prompted changes within its high-performance programme. The previous high-performance director, on conclusion of his contract, has departed the role and the programme is now operating under new leadership.  It is also important to note that all national governing bodies are independent autonomous organisations responsible for their own governance, including safeguarding procedures, personnel choices, and disciplinary and complaints processes. \n Deputy Ruairí Ó Murchú  I am not going to get into the specifics of this. We have all seen it. We know those who have been named. We were even very shocked in relation to the people who, luckily enough, brought this to the attention of the world. What the Minister of State said sounds fine. It is just about ensuring not only that Rowing Ireland has sufficient protocols to ensure we are looking after the welfare of all those involved, including staff, but particularly those who are going out there and doing their absolute for this country. We have had huge success in relation to that but in terms of anything that relates to the issues I have read about, I am not going to go into it because I accept there is nobody here to defend themselves in relation to it. I accept what the Minister of State is talking about in relation to staff being dealt with but can we ensure that we have the protocols across the board, that we have the checks and balances, and that Sport Ireland is also playing its part to ensure that we do not have lapses or situations like this? We will never have a perfect system but we need to make sure that we look after those who are doing their utmost in the sporting field and in other fields. \n Deputy Charlie McConalogue  Sport Ireland has a comprehensive approach to athlete well-being and that is reflected in its athlete welfare policy under the high performance strategy, which runs from 2021 to 2032. To support that policy, national governing bodies are expected to develop their own internal documents, which reflect best practice strategies in respect of athlete welfare.  In 2021, Sport Ireland introduced a culture evolution programme to support national governing bodies to protect and maximise the holistic experience and welfare of athletes, coaches and support staff. This includes a culture review process, an audit delivered by the high performance culture and integrity adviser. That high performance culture and integrity adviser was appointed in 2021 to support that process and to support that engagement with the national governing bodies as well.  In August 2023, a new national code of conduct template for sporting organisations was launched by Sport Ireland. That code of conduct template sets out the guidelines and principles and promotes the behaviour and conduct expected from our athletes, coaches, parents, guardians, supporters, referees, officials and club members. \n Deputy Ruairí Ó Murchú  I appreciate what the Minister of State said. As I said, I was shocked when I saw it, in particular in relation to the sport where we have had a huge level of success. I suppose the question is: how do we ensure this code of conduct is to a degree enforced or policed and that each of the national governing bodies has sufficient level of protocols, checks and balances to ensure we look after the welfare of all those involved from the staff and athletes throughout? \n Deputy Charlie McConalogue  We do it by having the right policies and support network in place, as I said, in terms of the work over the past three or four years, in terms of developing the national approach and the programme to support this and, in particular, the appointment of the high performance culture and integrity adviser to support that work. The latter is an important piece to do with it. Sport Ireland certainly is leading out on this. We very much support that work and acknowledge the absolute importance of it too. ",
