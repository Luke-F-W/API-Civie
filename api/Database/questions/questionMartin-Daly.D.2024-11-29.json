        "answerText": " Minister for Defence  The Naval Service currently has a fleet of eight vessels. Four of the vessels are regularly deployed on Maritime Defence and Security Operations (MDSO). These four vessels consist of three P60 class vessels as well as the L.É. Aoibhinn (P71) with all four vessels conducting patrols on a rotation basis.  The vessels routinely carry out monitoring and surveillance of Ireland’s Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ). The Air Corps Maritime Patrol Squadron also carry out aerial surveillance of the Irish EEZ using C295 maritime patrol aircraft equipped with state-of-the-art surveillance and communication equipment.  In addition to at sea monitoring, the Naval Operations Command Centre in Haulbowline carries out remote monitoring twenty four hours a day, seven days a week.  In relation to air defence capability, the current Ground Based Air Defence (GBAD) radar and missile systems are approaching obsolescence and, as a result, the development of a new ground based air defence system, including Counter Unmanned Aircraft Systems (C-UAS) elements, is a key objective of the overall Military Radar Programme. In line with the Commission on the Defence Forces recommendations, this will be compatible with and integrated into the Recognised Air Picture (RAP). The required GBAD capability will need to be deployable, scalable and fully interoperable to protect against any potential air threats.  Good progress is being made across all elements. I was pleased to recently welcome the approval by the Dáil of the Government’s proposal for a substantive capital supplementary estimate of €19 million on the Defence Vote. It is intended that the additional budget allocation will be used to procure, in an accelerated manner, Counter Unmanned Aerial System (C-UAS) capabilities for the Defence Forces, that will provide enhanced aerial protection around Baldonnel and ensure that the facility can remain fully operational at all times.  It is anticipated that delivery of the C-UAS capability will be available for use by the Defence Forces, if needed, as part of the comprehensive security arrangements to be put in place during Ireland’s Presidency of the Council of the European Union in the second half of 2026.

        "answerText": " Minister of State at the Department of Public Expenditure, Infrastructure, Public Service Reform and Digitalisation  I propose to take Questions Nos. 372 and 373 together.    The Flood Risk Management Plan for the Shannon River Basin which launched in 2018, included a recommendation to progress a flood relief scheme for Ballinasloe, Co. Galway. A Project Steering Group, comprising representatives from the Office of Public Works (OPW), as Contracting Authority, and Galway County Council as project partners, is in place to progress the Scheme under the Arterial Drainage Acts 1945 and 1995 (as amended).  In 2019, the OPW appointed Engineering and Environmental Consultants to complete the design of the Scheme, which will provide protection to 309 residential and commercial properties when complete. The Government has committed funding to support the delivery of flood relief schemes under the National Development Plan to 2030.  The Scheme is currently at Stage I, which covers the scheme development and design. This stage experienced delays due to additional modelling requirements, delays in completing key surveys and engaging with other key stakeholders.  Surveys and assessments are ongoing by the consultants in advance of preparation of the Environmental Impact Assessment Report which is due to commence shortly.  As part of the consultation process for the Scheme, and in order to raise awareness of the proposed flood mitigation works, a Public Consultation Day was held on 5th March 2020. A further Public Consultation to discuss the emerging options for the Scheme took place in Q1 2024. It is anticipated that the Statutory Public Exhibition for the Scheme will commence in Q2 2026 and for the scheme to be submitted to the Minister for Public Expenditure, Infrastructure, Public Service Reform and Digitalisation for statutory confirmation in Q2 2027. Subject to planning consent, construction of the scheme is scheduled to commence in Q2 2028.    Flood works in Derrymullen, Ballinasloe, were initiated in 2010 following major flooding in the 2009 flood event, and constructed from 2010 to 2011. The works comprised of the construction of a flood relief wall around Derrymullen, installation of penstock and flood gates and were constructed to provide protection against a 1% AEP (100 year) fluvial event from the Deerpark River for 135 properties. As part of the overall development of the Ballinasloe Flood Relief Scheme the OPW needed to ensure that the existing flood defences constructed in Derrymullen were to the same standard of design and construction as the proposed Ballinasloe scheme. The hydraulic modelling completed for the Ballinasloe scheme identified that alterations were required to the existing Derrymullen flood defences and this required additional assessments and designs. Upgrades to the existing works are planned as part of the overall Ballinasloe Flood Relief Scheme.  The Department of Finance has overall responsibility for policy matters in relation to insurance, including flood insurance. The Department of Finance engages with the insurance industry on all aspects of insurance reform, including flood cover issues. These matters are a priority for the Government and efforts continue to be made to encourage a responsive approach to the provision of flood insurance from the insurance industry. The Minister of State at the Department of Finance with special responsibility for Financial Services, Credit Unions and Insurance has met with the CEOs of the major insurers where he strongly emphasised to industry the need to take a reasonable approach to the provision of cover where properties are proven to be in low risk areas, including after investment in flood defences.  The OPW has a role to assist insurance companies to take into account the protection provided by completed flood defence schemes. In this regard, the OPW has a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) with Insurance Ireland, the representative body of the insurance industry. The MoU sets out principles of how the two organisations work together to ensure that appropriate and relevant information on these completed schemes is provided to insurers to facilitate, to the greatest extent possible, the availability to the public of insurance against the risk of flooding.  While the MoU does not guarantee the availability of insurance, Insurance Ireland members have committed to take into account all information provided by the OPW when assessing exposure to flood risk within these protected areas. The decision on whether to offer insurance, the level of premiums charged and the policy terms applied are matters for individual insurers. Insurance companies make commercial decisions on the provision of insurance cover based on their assessment of the risks they would be accepting on a case-by-case basis. Neither the Minister for Finance or the Central Bank of Ireland can direct the provision or pricing of insurance products, in accordance with the EU framework for insurance (Solvency II Directive).  Insurance Ireland operates an Insurance Information Service for those who have queries, complaints or difficulties in relation to obtaining insurance, which can be contacted at 01 676 1914 or [ feedback@insuranceireland.eu ]. Similarly, Brokers Ireland, the representative body for insurance brokers in Ireland, has access to a wide range of providers and products, and can offer advice for customers when sourcing cover. Brokers Ireland can be reached at 01 661 3067. Furthermore, where an individual considers that they have been treated unfairly, they have the option of making a complaint to the Financial Services and Pensions Ombudsman (FSPO). The FSPO can be contacted either by email at [ info@fspo.ie ] or by telephone at 01 567 7000. ",

Advanced Practice is an important tool for optimising the capacity of the existing health workforce, supporting the development of career pathways and workforce retention. Budget 2025 allocated €5.5 million for funding to support continued growth of Advanced Practice in nursing and midwifery and enable this to be rolled out for the first time for Health and Social Care Professionals (HSCPs).  The HSE has established a multi-stakeholder Advanced Practice Implementation Oversight Group (APIOG) focused on the development of HSCP Advanced Practice services. The 2025 HSCP Advanced Practice identification and selection process was developed by the APIOG to ensure transparent, evidence-based, and strategically aligned decision-making for the allocation of Advanced Practice resources. Thirty Candidate Advanced Practitioner HSCP posts are to be recruited, including Candidate Advanced Practitioner roles in occupational therapy.  The Department continues to work with the HSE in the further roll out of Advanced Practice HSCP as evidence and readiness develop. ",

        "answerText": " Minister for Health  The development of primary care services – alongside social and community care more broadly – is central to this Government's aim of delivering a high-quality, integrated and cost-effective health care system, with services provided as close to home as possible.  The Enhanced Community Care (ECC) programme is allocated €195m in recurring annual funding and forms part of wider efforts to deliver on Sláintecare and the promise of care being delivered in the right place at the right time and as close to home as possible. The ECC programme includes a number of different elements that enhance primary care services across the country.  Amongst other initiatives, the funding has allowed for the full rollout of 96 Community Healthcare Networks (CHNs) and enables the continued development of 30 Community Specialist Teams for Older Persons, and 30 Community Specialist Teams for the Management of Chronic Diseases, and with full national coverage by Community Intervention Teams achieved.  All 96 CHNs are now operational, servicing local populations of 50,000 people per network, and supporting GPs in providing integrated, community-based care. 27 Community Specialist Teams (CSTs) for Older Persons are operational, alongside 26 Community Specialist teams for Chronic Disease management working in an integrated way with acute services to support older patients and those with chronic illnesses across the areas of diabetes, respiratory and cardiology.  Throughout 2025, the Programme has focused on increasing productivity and impact. This is being achieved through continued focus on consolidating the ECC Model and increasing activity with the resources available through increased technology uptake and the scaling of digital initiatives.  This year to date (end Q3, latest data) Community Healthcare Networks have seen over 842,000 patients. CSTs for Older Persons also continue to increase activity, with over 106,000 patient contacts delivered to the end of September with a significant majority of these (84%) discharged home, demonstrating continued effective community management for fragile and complex patient cases for those over 75, alongside these 344,000 patient contacts were also delivered by CSTs for Chronic Disease Management (37% ahead of target).  Community Intervention Teams (CIT) also continue to perform strongly, with over 100,000 referrals to the end of October 2025. This demonstrates activity which is 10% ahead of target for the year to date. Patients accessing CIT services are enabled to avoid hospital attendance or admittance and to be discharged earlier from hospitals to receive appropriate care in their homes.  Since January 2021, GPs now have increased direct access to MRI, DEXA and CT scans and X-ray via the GP Access to Community Diagnostics initiative. This structured pathway for GPs to directly access diagnostic tests for their patients, which is open to referrals for the full adult population aged 16 years and over, enables a greater level of care to be delivered in the community, supporting patient-centred care, early diagnosis, and early intervention.  Over 280k scans of various modalities were completed through the GP Access to Community Diagnostics Scheme in 2024, resulting in a reduction of over 85% in patients requiring diagnostic referral to emergency departments or acute medical units, and approximately 25% diverted from public hospital radiology departments. Over 187k scans have been provided in 2025 as of September, continuing to support access to diagnostic scans in the community for patients.  Furthermore, a mobile x-ray service, provided by Mobile Medical Diagnostics (MMD), is now operating nationally in 2025. The service is targeted primarily to older persons residing in nursing homes, however access is also available to those in community disability units and private dwellings where attendance for an X-ray outside their home might pose challenges.  Nationally, we have made real progress in developing our primary care infrastructure. There is a total of 180 Primary Care Centres (PCCs) operational across the country with 51 of these PCCs opening since 2020. A further seven Primary Care Centres are currently in construction, with two of these PCCs due to open by year end 2025 and a further four are due to open in 2026.  I am very conscious, in particular, of the central role that primary care therapies play for children and adults in offering the opportunity for earlier, cost-effective and impactful interventions. It is important to recognise that overall activity within the eight core primary care therapies is significant. While it is important to note that some 1.4 million patients were seen in 2024, and 1.1 million patients have been seen as of October 2025, I fully acknowledge that waiting lists for primary care therapies have increased significantly.  Building on successful local initiatives, in September this year, I asked the CEO of the HSE to put measures in place to address physiotherapy, occupational therapy, and speech and language therapy lists in order to reduce the waiting times for these three therapies to less than 10 months. It is expected that this measure will remove 60,000 people from the waiting lists across the three therapies.  This initiative is being supported by a joint programmatic approach between the Department and the HSE, which aims to make an immediate impact, while also progressing sustainable reform across these Primary Care therapies.  These investments and reforms are a demonstration of the commitment to shift the focus of healthcare delivery towards a more comprehensive and accessible primary care service in order to deliver better care, closer to people’s homes, in communities across the country.

        "answerText": " Minister for Health  I propose to take Questions Nos. 587 and 588 together.  The Long-Term Illness (LTI) Scheme was established under Section 59(3) of the Health Act 1970 (as amended). Regulations were made in 1971, 1973 and 1975, prescribing 16 conditions to be covered by the Scheme. Further information, including the list of conditions, can be found at:  www2.hse.ie/services/schemes-allowances/lti/about/.  Under the LTI Scheme, patients receive drugs, medicines, and medical and surgical appliances directly related to the treatment of their illness, free of charge. While there are currently no plans to extend the list of conditions, it is important to remember that the LTI Scheme exists within a wider eligibility framework.  People who cannot, without undue hardship, arrange for the provision of medical services for themselves and their dependants may be eligible for a medical card under the General Medical Services (GMS) Scheme. In accordance with the provisions of the Health Act 1970 (as amended), eligibility for a medical card is determined by the HSE.  In certain circumstances the HSE may exercise discretion and grant a medical card, even though an applicant exceeds the income guidelines, where he or she faces difficult financial circumstances, such as extra costs arising from illness. The HSE afford applicants the opportunity to furnish supporting documentation to determine whether undue hardship exists and to fully take account of all relevant circumstances that may benefit them in assessment. In circumstances where an applicant is still over the income limit for a medical card, they are then assessed for a GP visit card, which entitles the applicant to GP visits without charge.  The issue of granting medical card eligibility based on having a particular disability or illness was previously examined in 2014 by the HSE Expert Panel on Medical Need and Medical Card Eligibility. The Group concluded that it was not feasible, desirable, nor ethically justifiable to list medical conditions in priority order for medical card eligibility. In following the Expert Group’s advice, a person’s means remains the main qualifier for a medical card.  Under the Drugs Payment Scheme (DPS), no individual or family pays more than €80 a month towards the cost of approved prescribed medicines. The DPS is not means tested and is available to anyone ordinarily resident in Ireland. The DPS significantly reduces the cost burden for families and individuals with ongoing expenditure on medicines.  There has been a significant focus on improving access to and the affordability of healthcare services over the last few years. This includes reductions in the DPS threshold, expansion of access to free GP care, and the abolition of all public in-patient hospital charges for children and adults. These measures continue to create a health and social care service that offers affordable access to quality healthcare.  Individuals may also be entitled to claim tax relief on the cost of their medical expenses, including medicines prescribed by a doctor, dentist, or consultant. Relief is at the standard tax rate of 20%. ",
