        "answerText": " Minister of State at the Department of Public Expenditure, Infrastructure, Public Service Reform and Digitalisation  The Department of Finance has overall responsibility for policy matters in relation to insurance, including flood insurance. The Department of Finance engages with the insurance industry on all aspects of insurance reform, including flood cover issues. These matters are a priority for the Government and efforts continue to be made to encourage a responsive approach to the provision of flood insurance from the insurance industry.  The Flood Maps are available to the public at www.floodinfo.ie. However, it is important to note that they are community based maps. The maps were not designed to designate individual properties at risk. The maps show the probable extent of flooding based on current and future projections.  The Disclaimer and Conditions for Use of the OPW Flood Maps on www.floodinfo.ie includes a provision that users of the website must not use the Flood Maps, or any other content of the website for commercial purposes. As such, the Disclaimer prevents insurance companies from using the flood maps generated by the OPW.  The insurance industry has its own flood modelling tools for assessing the level of risk that it is willing to underwrite in relation to individual properties. Insurance Ireland, the representative body of the insurance industry, has highlighted to the OPW that it does not use the OPW flood maps to inform its flood modelling. The decision on whether to offer insurance, the level of premiums charged and the policy terms applied are matters for individual insurers. Insurance companies make commercial decisions on the provision of insurance cover based on their assessment of the risks they would be accepting on a case-by-case basis. In accordance with the EU framework for insurance (Solvency II Directive), the Government cannot direct the provision or pricing of insurance products. ",

The Programme for Government, Securing Ireland's Future, commits the Department to publish and implement an updated National Strategy for Women and Girls. The Department is currently working to fulfill that commitment. A stakeholder consultation was completed at the end of 2024. This included a series of in-person consultations with representations from across civil society as well as an online survey which included both civil society organisations and members of the public.  Additionally, in September 2024 the first National Youth Assembly on Gender Equality was convened to attain the views of young people on priorities for inclusion in the new strategy. This assembly was specifically designed to provide young people with an opportunity to discuss how gender inequality affects their lives, explore solutions, and make recommendations that could be integrated into national policy.  An engagement event was hosted in March 2025 by the Department with the support of the National Women's Council to both mark International Women's Day and to provide an update to stakeholders. The findings from the stakeholder consultation and National Youth Assembly event were discussed followed by a prioritisation exercise to help identify potential gaps in the findings and areas for further consideration.  An Interdepartmental Strategy Committee has been formed to oversee the development and implementation of the Strategy. This Committee has been meeting regularly over the past several weeks to further develop strategic actions and ensure the Strategy is underpinned by a whole-of-Government approach.  The Strategy is currently at an advanced draft stage and is anticipated to be completed and published in Q4 of 2025. ",

At present, the majority of licences appealed are set aside and remitted to the Department. Appeals can be made on any number of grounds and have become more complex since the foundation of the FAC.  My Department is working actively to improve the time it takes to process cases by the FAC. It has also changed how it processes licences to take account of FAC decisions including making changes to the wording of licence conditions and how it explains the reasoning of those conditions, so as to help improve the process.  Further, Minister Healy-Rae has also written to the FAC requesting that plots affected by storm damage be prioritised.  I expect that these initiatives will begin to allow the FAC to expedite the affirmation of more Department decisions on licences. "

        "answerText": " Minister for Culture, Communications and Sport  Under the Arts Act 2003, the Arts Council has primary responsibility for the development of the arts in Ireland and Budget 2025 has provided record funding of €140 million for the Arts Council. The Arts Council is committed to increasing public engagement in the arts in Ireland and it provides financial support to a number of initiatives aimed at increasing public access, participation and engagement in the arts.  The Council invests funding in a range of art forms and developmental projects including Creative Schools, Creative Places, Creative Europe and Culture Night. For example, Culture Night, in collaboration with RTÉ, creates opportunities for artists at all levels. Details of all these programmes are available on the Arts Council's website. The Council also supports festivals across the country providing opportunities for performances of many forms.  The Arts Council recognises the value the distinctive role of amateur arts practice, its important contribution to the vitality of the arts and of certain artforms in particular, and its many social benefits. It supports non-commercial, professional theatre production in Ireland. It seeks to support artistic excellence both in the standard of practice and level of ambition. The Arts Council recognises the many and varied ways theatre artists work, and aims to support artists whose work seeks to engage in a meaningful way with audiences across Ireland and beyond by supporting the creation, development, production and dissemination of theatre.  The Arts Council also works to develop supportive initiatives to recognise and interact with the voluntary and amateur sector towards the mutual goal of advocating for theatre and the arts in general.  Within my Department, there are a number of measures in place to support the arts at amateur and professional levels including:  • Annual funding provided to Comhaltas Ceoltóirí Éireann for its work in the protection and promotion of Irish traditional music and culture.  • The Music Capital Scheme, managed by Music Network on behalf of my Department, provides funding for the purchase of musical instruments to both non-professional performing groups/ensembles and professional musicians.  • A small-scale local festivals and summer schools scheme designed to support local cultural festivals and summer schools that may not be eligible under funding criteria for larger scale events supported by Fáilte Ireland, the Arts Council and similar bodies. The maximum funding available under this scheme is capped at €5,000.  • Creative Ireland Programme funding in 2023 is supporting the delivery of a number of creative projects nationwide.  • A new pilot capital support scheme for Arts, Culture and the Night Time Economy will support development of vibrant late night arts and culture scenes in Irish cities, towns and villages as well as additional capital to assist in the provision of building and equipment needs, artists’ workspaces, and adapting facilities to reduce energy needs and carbon footprints.  • In 2025 €8m, which is the highest level of funding for Culture Ireland since its establishment, will support more Irish artists to launch and develop their careers on an international stage.  • The Basic Income for the Arts pilot scheme which is €105m scheme involving 2,000 artists and creative arts workers nationwide.  • Funding for the Safe to Create Programme, including Minding Creative Minds, that supports all artists and creatives.  • Funding is provided for cultural events such as Other Voices and Fleadh Cheoil na hÉireann that in turn helps to sustain the arts at all levels.  • Funding programmes within the Broadcasting and Media area also serve to promote many artists and creative talents from across the music sector.  Additionally, a network of cultural infrastructure exists throughout the country with the majority in the ownership of local authorities. Annual support, including programming and revenue supports, is provided to these arts centres by local authorities and the Arts Council. These Arts Centres are where artists and audiences meet and this is a key part of the Arts Council strategy to invest in public engagement. My Department focuses on providing capital grant funding to assist development and to maintain these arts and cultural facilities. Funding is administered through applications received for specific grant schemes.  Notwithstanding the official supports described above, it would be appropriate to mention the significant number of commercial sponsors who also contribute towards the national associations and annual programmes for amateur drama and musicals. I take this opportunity to acknowledge their generous support to the national bodies and also to commend the special contribution of the title sponsor of the RTÉ All Ireland Drama Festival in Athlone  which took place from the 8th to the 16th of May this year in Athlone under the auspices of the Amateur Drama Council of Ireland.

As part of the application process for all applications received, an independent Expert Panel is tasked with evaluating and reviewing each individual project, assessing the information provided in the application against the objective of the programme and making recommendations for my consideration on their suitability of funding.  Given the large number of applications received and in order to allow work to begin on projects as soon as possible, it was decided to take a phased approach to funding approval. In November 2024, funding of €47.1m for 256 individual projects was approved. The projects being funded will improve water services for households throughout rural areas of the country.  The remaining applications have been considered by the Expert Panel and I expect to receive its recommendations for my consideration and decision shortly. ",

Initial eligibility reviews, a full appraisal process and further suitability checks were undertaken of the applications. The Office of Public Works (OPW) and Pobal completed appraisals of eligible applications against three criteria - evidence of need, quality of application and readiness to progress the project.  Of the 78 applications received, 11 were deemed ineligible and therefore did not progress to the appraisal stage. Of the 67 applications appraised, 49 met the qualifying standards.  I was delighted to announce on Monday 19th May the 49 applications which will be progressing to the next stage of the process. These 49 applications come from a mix of Community Extension (24), Private Extension (7), Community Purchasing (4) and Community Construction (14) projects, which, when completed, will deliver almost 1,500 additional full time childcare places for 1-3 year olds across the country.

        "answerText": " Deputy David Maxwell  I want to start by thanking the Minister for bringing together all of the parties to work out sensible solutions to eliminate TB on Irish farms. \n Deputy Martin Heydon  I thank the Deputy for raising this important issue, which I know is of concern to his constituents in Cavan-Monaghan. On 8 May, I held a TB summit with key stakeholders where discussions were held on the most effective ways to mitigate the impact of bovine TB on farm families and reduce herd incidence and spread of the disease. The backdrop to this meeting was the need to address the deteriorating bovine TB disease levels. Herd incidence increased from 4.31% in 2022 to 6.04% in 2024, which was a 36% increase in the number of herds restricted. Over 6,000 farm families were affected by a TB outbreak in 2024.  At the summit, I presented 30 potential actions underpinned by five key pillars to address the current rates of bovine TB: first, to support herds free of bovine TB to remain free; second, to reduce the impact of wildlife on the spread of bovine TB; third, to detect and eliminate bovine TB infection as early as possible in herds with a TB breakdown and avoid a future breakdown; fourth, to help farmers improve all areas of on farm biosecurity; and fifth; to reduce the impact of known high-risk animals in spreading bovine TB.  As part of this engagement, a proposal to restrict the sale of certain cows from breeding herds of greater than 60 cows that have had an outbreak of TB with three or more standard reactors in the previous three years to other breeding herds was discussed. Only cows present as part of the milking group at the time of breakdown would have such a restriction imposed. This would not apply to calves or replacement animals in these herds if there were no reactors in those groups of animals. This proposal is aimed at ensuring residual or undetected infection does not enter into clear herds inadvertently through the sale of these high-risk animals. The risk of these animals having residual infection is highest in the first three years following a clear test, hence the necessity for ensuring these animals do not go on to transmit infection into clear herds. I will expand further in my supplementary response. \n Deputy David Maxwell  I thank the Minister. Everyone agrees there is an urgent need to make major changes to the TB programme to try to get this disease back under control. We know that the Department and farmers have put forward plenty of proposals to address all sources of the disease and look at measures to mitigate its spread. Farmers are concerned that the risk-based trading ignores the most fundamental objective of stopping the spread of TB. The Department’s proposal does not stop TB spread. It merely compounds the losses for farmers who, through no fault of their own, have had TB outbreaks and are just returning to some normality on their farms and trying to get themselves going well again. They feel this risk-based trading is a hindrance. \n Deputy Martin Heydon  The engagement I had on this and all other proposed actions with the stakeholders will feed into the draft proposals to help contribute to a more effective programme that protects farmers and their families from this disease impacting their herds. I will meet the farm organisations again later this week to discuss updated proposals on foot of our discussions. This has been a deliberative process since February and we have been back and forth. I have listened and taken on board many of the points and concerns that the Deputy raised.  I hope to achieve a broad consensus on these proposals but there is an urgency and I intend to move quickly to refine the programme and ensure that the necessary steps are taken to reduce the impact of this disease on farmers and their families because I know how devastating it is. However, I must be clear. The science is very clear: there are three key contributors to the spread and escalation of bovine TB as we have seen in Ireland in recent years. One is wildlife, one is cattle-to-cattle transmission and one is the residual effect in herds that have had a significant breakdown. We must address all three issues in any final solution. \n Deputy David Maxwell  Our dairy industry is a critical part of rural Ireland and the production of milk is essential for our economy. In recent years, the number of farmers leaving the sector has risen. If this ban is put in place, it could be the final straw for some farmers to leave the sector where, through no fault of their own, they cannot trade in marts for three years because their herds are restricted. If this happens, who is going to compensate the farmer for the significant loss he or she could suffer?  We all understand that action is needed to tackle the scourge of TB but I ask the Minister to look again at this proposal and not end up putting farmers at the mercy of having to deal with a closed market for three years. It is not just about the financial loss for our farmers but also the emotional loss that can affect a farmer and his or her family when a herd goes down with TB. \n Deputy Colm Burke  It is extremely frightening to see a 36% increase in the number of herds restricted over a two-year period and the whole increase over the past five years. It is important that we do everything possible in the shortest time to reduce the numbers as well as the reasons they have increased so dramatically in such a short period. I know officials in the Department, the veterinary profession and farmers are working hard but everything possible must be done to deal with this issue in as short a time as possible. Over the next three to four years - it will take that time to reduce the numbers - everything must be thrown at it to ensure that the restrictions that need to be put in place to stop the spread of TB are put in place and fully complied with. \n Deputy William Aird  Before we go on, I would describe it as a drastic move to curb a farmer from selling his or her stock in a mart for up to three years. Does the Minister realise what he is doing to farmers, people like myself who get up every morning and work? There is no guarantee about this. We are talking about something that got worse and worse despite the money that was invested in the scheme. There is no guarantee that taking a draconian step like this would have any effects. This would be a stigma attached to farmers like myself where, at the end of the day, there is no guarantee that anything would change.  I want to know who came up with this idea. What scientific results has that person to prove that something like this will happen? It is like we are saying we will try this and it might work. Something like this would have a devastating effect on Irish farmers. \n Deputy Martin Heydon  There are two key priorities for me. I know the emotional turmoil there is with having a reactor – the impact it has on families as well as the financial impact. The two clear priorities I have is to ensure that those farmers and farm families that are currently affected or will be affected in the future by a bovine TB breakdown have a clear pathway out of that and that we ensure that fewer are affected in future. The scale of the challenge at the minute is significant and deteriorating, so it cannot be business as usual. In the whole of 2020, my Department spent €20 million on compensation for farmers who had reactors and breakdowns. We spent €20 million compensating farmers in the first four months of this year. That is the trajectory we are dealing with, so it cannot be business as usual, but I guarantee that any measures adopted are based on the best scientific and veterinary advice. Through strong leadership by all involved in the programme and by working together, we can bring in the necessary measures, as Deputy Burke outlined, that will make a meaningful difference, stop this infection increasing and drive down its spread greatly so that we can get back to credibly talking about eradication again.

        "answerText": " Minister of State at the Department of Transport  I wish to thank the Deputy for his question.  The Government has earmarked €5.1bn for capital spending on new national roads projects from 2021 to 2030 as part of the NDP. As the greater portion of this funding becomes available in the second half of the decade, this means that there was a constraint on the funding available for new projects this year. However, I can confirm that approximately €600 million of exchequer capital funds was provided to local authorities through TII for national roads in 2025.  The N2 Clontibret to the Border project is currently at the Design and Environmental Evaluation stage of the project management guidelines, and is expected to be submitted for approval in principal under the Infrastructure Guidelines in late 2025 or early 2026. Subject to approval, the project would then proceed through the statutory processes, including a planning application. As part of the national road allocations for 2025, the project received an allocation of €3,000,000.  The next element of the upgrades needed to the North West’s road network is the N2 Ardee to Castleblayney project which is also at the Design and Environmental Evaluation stage. I’m delighted to say that next year’s allocations will allow for this element of the project to proceed in support of the Clontibret to the Border project and I look forward to seeing this element of the project proceed at pace in the years ahead. These schemes south of the Border will of course link in with the A5 north of the Border which will itself be supported by funding of €600m from the Exchequer and which will link into the Donegal TEN-T Improvement scheme as approved by Government last year. Taken together these schemes will significantly upgrade connectivity to the North West region.  Finally I am pleased to note that a number of new roads projects which are included in the current NDP have already been delivered. This includes the N22 Ballyvourney to Macroom project, the Dunkettle Interchange upgrade, the N5 Westport to Turlough, and bypasses of Moycullen and Listowel. The Programme for Government commits to increased funding for new roads and for the maintenance of existing roads, as part of the current NDP review process.  I hope that this information is of assistance to you. ",
