        "answerText": " Minister for Climate, Energy and the Environment  Government remains committed to the development of 5 gigawatts (GW) of offshore wind capacity with projects in construction by 2030 and energised as soon as feasible thereafter.  Much work has been done on setting the right regulatory and policy background for the achievement of our ambitious offshore wind targets.  The Maritime Area Planning Act, which established a new framework for the planning and regulation of development and activities within Ireland's maritime area, was enacted in 2021. Subsequently, the Maritime Area Consents (MACs) for six offshore wind projects were issued in 2022. Ireland's first offshore wind auction, ORESS 1, was held in May 2023. In addition, the Maritime Area Regulatory Authority was established in July 2023.  Our offshore ambitions were set out in detail in our Phase Two Policy Statement published in 2023, while the Future Framework published in 2024 identified targets of 20 GW by 2040 and up to 37 GW by 2050, with a range of actions to support achievement of these targets. The initial 5 GW target has been reiterated in the Climate Action Plan 2025 and in the Programme for Government.  Five offshore wind projects are presently in development off our east coast. These include three projects with support contracts arising from our 2023 auction, and two projects pursuing a merchant route to market through corporate power purchase agreements. Collectively, the five projects account for 3.8 GW, more than half of our current peak electricity demand. The five projects are anticipating a planning determination from An Coimisiún Pleanála in 2026. Subject to planning consent, I would anticipate that the projects will be in construction by 2030 and operational by 2031/32.  On 26 November, I was delighted to announce ESB and Orsted as the provisional winners of my Department's second offshore wind auction, the 900 MW Tonn Nua site in the South Coast DMAP. Subject to planning consent, I anticipate that this project will connect to the grid in 2033.  I am making arrangements to bring the remaining three South Coast DMAP sites to auction, which will add a further 4 GW. A further pipeline of development sites within the National DMAP will follow from 2028 onwards. ",

The vision for the project is to create an inspiring music organisation, featuring a main auditorium which will be home to the National Symphony Orchestra. To meet this objective, the redeveloped auditorium will also feature a concert organ, built specifically for the new space.  I can confirm that, while earlier this year the NCH conducted a tender process for appointment of an organ builder, no organ has been purchased at this stage and the purpose of the ongoing process is to align the organ design with the progressing design for the building. Further work on the organ will be progressed with line with the development of the Concert Hall. In regard to the existing organ, options are being considered in regard to its future use post the redevelopment of the NCH. ",

The regulations for these Safety Partnerships came into operation on Monday 30 June, and a total of 36 Partnerships are in the process of being established in local authority areas across the country.  A number of administrative steps need to be undertaken to facilitate the establishment of a Safety Partnership in a given area, including nomination of proposed members by local authorities and statutory bodies, and the appointment of all members by myself as Minister.  The National Office for Community Safety, an office of my Department, is providing support to local authorities and in particular to Local Community Safety Partnership teams, in the process of establishing each Safety Partnership in their area.  I have appointed members to 32 Local Community Safety Partnerships and I expect to be making further appointments in the near future.  On 11 December 2025, I appointed members to all five Dublin City LCSPs including Dublin South Central. On that date I also appointed members to Fingal North, Fingal West, South Dublin and Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown Safety Partnerships.  The convening of LCSP meetings is a matter determined at local level. That being said, I am given to understand that a number of induction meetings are being held by Dublin City Council over the course of this week with inaugural meetings due to be held in the new year.

        "answerText": " Minister for Public Expenditure, Infrastructure, Public Service Reform and Digitalisation  As the Deputy may be aware, I have overarching responsibility for public service pensions policy, including in relation to pension contributions.  There are a number of different pension schemes in operation in the public service; in answering this query I will refer to those for entrants prior to 2013 as pre-existing schemes. The other relevant scheme here is the Single Scheme which was introduced under the Public Service Pensions (Single Scheme and Other Provisions) Act 2012 (the \"2012 Act\").  Members of the Single Scheme continue to accrue pension benefits beyond 40 years, and they are not subject to the 40-year rule as set out in the 2012 Act. It is a Career-Average Defined Benefit Pension Scheme. Single Scheme retirement benefits are based on a percentage of total pensionable earnings throughout the individual's public service career as a member of the Scheme.  In accordance with the 2012 Act, pensionable service under pre-existing public service pension schemes is capped at 40 years for the purpose of calculating retirement benefits. This cap applies across all such schemes and is implemented in accordance with Circular 13/2020, which sets out financial limits for members with service in more than one scheme.  In line with scheme rules, standard pension contributions, including those for the Spouses’ and Children’s Pension Scheme, continue to be deducted while the person remains in employment. Pension contributions to the Spouses’ and Children’s Pension Scheme in excess of 40 years are refunded to the member upon retirement, starting with the earliest contributions. Main scheme contributions are not refundable.  In general pre-existing schemes operate on a final pensionable remuneration basis, this means that while contributions are paid throughout the career based on varying rates of remuneration, benefits are based on the final pensionable remuneration at retirement.  It should be noted that the contributions paid throughout the course of the member's career do not directly correspond to retirement benefits payable in the public service pension schemes and do not reflect the full cost of those benefits.

The person concerned was also given the right to appeal the decision to the independent Social Welfare Appeals Office.  As the person concerned has since passed away, section 339 of the Social Welfare Consolidation Act 2005 (as amended) requires the personal representative of a deceased claimant to ensure that sufficient assets are retained, to the extent (if any) appropriate, to repay any sum determined to be due to the Minister or the State. Recovery of any overpayment, therefore, may only be recovered to the extent to which it can be met from the estate, if any, allowing for reasonable funeral and legal expenses for which the estate is liable.

It assesses the individual’s needs and eligibility for Tusla services and will also decide whether to make an application for international protection on their behalf.

Separate statistics are not available on the outcome of such cases.  Regarding information provided by applicants: a key focus in the training, supervision and quality assurance of our process is in assessing the credibility of an individual application, including information they have supplied concerning their identity.  Ireland has opted in to the EU Asylum and Migration Pact which is due to enter operation in June 2026. The Pact will provide a fair, sustainable and efficient asylum procedure. This will be achieved through convergence in asylum practices across the EU.

Legislative and operational arrangements for the assessment of age are to be revised under this legislation and as part of implementing the Pact. The Bill will propose that the determining authority – the replacement for the International Protection Office - will arrange and be responsible for the management of age assessments. The new legislation also will set out in far greater detail how age is to be assessed and provide for regulations governing the standards, qualifications of personnel and so on for the purposes of that process.

In those cases where Tusla determine that the person is not eligible for services because they are judged to be an adult, the applicant is referred back to the IPO who will process their application and determine if the applicant has a well-founded fear of persecution or is at risk of serious harm in their country of origin, in accordance with the provisions of the International Protection Act.  Separate statistics are not available on the outcome of such cases.  Regarding information provided by applicants: a key focus in the training, supervision and quality assurance of our process is in assessing the credibility of an individual application, including information they have supplied concerning their identity.  Ireland has opted in to the EU Asylum and Migration Pact which is due to enter operation in June 2026. The Pact will provide a fair, sustainable and efficient asylum procedure. This will be achieved through convergence in asylum practices across the EU. The General Scheme of a new International Protection Bill to give effect to the measures of the Pact was approved by Government on 29 April 2025.  Legislative and operational arrangements for the assessment of age are to be revised under this legislation and as part of implementing the Pact. The Bill will propose that the determining authority – the replacement for the International Protection Office - will arrange and be responsible for the management of age assessments. The new legislation also will set out in far greater detail how age is to be assessed and provide for regulations governing the standards, qualifications of personnel and so on for the purposes of that process.  The Department works closely with Tusla in relation to all matters concerning minors, and is engaging with Tusla to design the new mechanism envisaged under the proposed legislation. ",

Thugamar gealltanas i gClár an Rialtais cur leis an líon deiseanna atá ag daltaí agus scoláirí freastal ar Ghaelscoileanna agus Gaelcholáistí, mar aon le Gaelscoileanna agus Gaelcholáistí a bhunú in áiteanna ina bhfuil éileamh orthu agus tacú le tuismitheoirí oideachas lán-Ghaeilge a roghnú dá leanaí.  Chuige sin, d’fhoilsigh mo roinn Polasaí nua don Oideachas lán-Ghaeilge lasmuigh den Ghaeltacht le déanaí. Mar chuid den pholasaí sin, bhunaigh mo roinn tascfhórsa um shamhlacha soláthair don oideachas lán-Ghaeilge, rud atá ar cheann de na príomhghníomhartha faoin bpolasaí.  Tá an tascfhórsa ag éascú comhoibriú idir mo roinn agus geallsealbhóirí chun na samhlacha éagsúla oideachais lán-Ghaeilge a scrúdú agus chun teacht ar bhealaí inar féidir an soláthar oideachais lán-Ghaeilge a mhéadú.  Beidh breithniú ar sholáthar múinteoirí do scoileanna lán-Ghaeilge ina thoisc ríthábhachtach in obair an tascfhórsa agus i soláthar oideachais ardchaighdeáin san earnáil.  Cuirfidh obair an tascfhórsa bonn eolais faoin gcur chuige a ghlacfar i leith an soláthar iar-bhunscoile lán-Ghaeilge a bhreithniú ar bhealach inbhuanaithe.  Idir an dá linn, leanann mo roinn le hobair i gcomhar le hIontaobhas Scoileanna Éamann Rís ar Scoil Bráithre Críostaí Shráid Synge i mBaile Átha Cliath 8 a athrú ó iar-bhunscoil lán-Bhéarla aonghnéis ina Gaelcholáiste comhoideachais ar bhonn céimnithe ó mhí Mheán Fómhair 2026.  Mar fhocal scoir, sheol mo roinn an ‘Suirbhé Bunscoile’ an 4 Samhain. Agus é ar an gceann is mó riamh dá leithéid de chuid mo roinne, tá an suirbhé sonrach don scoil agus iarrtar ann ar thuismitheoirí, caomhnóirí, baill foirne scoile agus comhaltaí Boird Bainistíochta a roghanna féin a chur in iúl i ndáil le roinnt gnéithe tábhachtacha de sholáthar bunscoile, lena n-áirítear teanga teagaisc na scoile.  Úsáidfear na roghanna a chuirfear in iúl sa suirbhé i ndáil le teanga an teagaisc chun bonn eolais a chur faoi chomhairliúchán féideartha áitiúil amach anseo maidir le deiseanna chun an soláthar oideachais trí Ghaeilge a mhéadú. Ní ionann an suirbhé agus an chéim dheireanach. I gcás go gcuirfidh tuismitheoirí agus caomhnóirí in iúl go soiléir go bhfuil siad i bhfách le hathrú, tosófar próiseas eile idirphlé ionchuimsithigh.

        "answerText": " Tánaiste and Minister for Finance  Section 481 TCA 1997 provides relief in the form of a corporation tax credit related to the cost of production of certain films. The scheme is intended to act as a stimulus to the creation of an indigenous film industry in the State, creating quality employment opportunities and supporting the expression of Irish culture. The credit is granted at a rate of 32% of up to €125 million.  I would note that copyright law falls within the remit of the Department of Enterprise, Tourism and Employment. Although compliance with copyright law is not a specific criterion as part of the application process for section 481, it is important to remember that section 481 is a tax credit and that copyright legislation applies regardless of whether it is referenced as part of a formal process associated with obtaining it.  Notwithstanding this, my officials have engaged in detail with relevant stakeholders in the sector, including representative bodies, to gain an understanding of the issues raised over the last number of years.  In order to identify a pathway forward, an independent facilitator was retained by Screen Ireland in 2023 to meet with a group of key stakeholders, to identify and understand issues relevant to the Digital Single Market Directive (referred to as the Copyright Directive). As a result of this process, industry stakeholders have agreed interim best practice industry guidelines while they pursue a path towards a collective bargaining agreement. This is a very positive step.  It is my view that direct engagement between industry bodies is the most effective pathway to resolving any remaining issues in respect of copyright. Should any issues with Copyright legislation as it currently stands be identified as part of this process, this will be a matter for the Minister of Enterprise, Tourism and Employment. However, my officials will continue to monitor progress in this area. ",

        "answerText": " Tánaiste and Minister for Finance  My Department has not specifically considered tax-based measures to support persons purchasing or building a house in the Gaeltacht.  However, the tax system already provides for a range of housing related measures, the great majority of which apply to all areas of the State, including the Gaeltacht. These include supports for renters, first-time buyers and providers of housing such as the Help to Buy scheme, the Rent Tax Credit, the Vacant Homes Tax, the Residential Zoned Land Tax and the Residential Premises Rental Income Relief. Finance Bill 2025 provides for further such measures.  Specifically, the Help to Buy incentive, is a scheme to assist first-time purchasers with the deposit they need to buy or build a new house or apartment. It also aims to encourage additional supply of new houses by supporting demand. The Help to Buy scheme provides a refund of Income Tax and Deposit Interest Retention Tax (DIRT) paid in Ireland over the previous four years, subject to limits outlined in the legislation. The scheme has supported some 60,500 individuals or couples to buy or build their own home since its inception in 2016.  Finally, the recently published \"Delivering Homes, Building Communities: An Action Plan on Housing Supply and Targeting Homelessness, 2025-2030\" sets out the Government's proposals to drive the delivery of homes across the State.

        "answerText": " Deputy Aengus Ó Snodaigh  Faoi Acht na dTithe (Gaeltacht) (Leasú), 2001, tá cumhachtaí ar leith ag an Aire. An bhfuil sé sásta na cumhachtaí sin a úsáid? An bhfuil sé tar éis a bheith i dteagmháil leis an Aire tithíochta chun go mbeidh sé ar an eolas faoi na cumhachtaí seo agus gur féidir leis an Aire deontais ar leith a thabhairt do dhaoine atá ag iarraidh a bheith ina gcónaí sa Ghaeltacht? \n Deputy Dara Calleary  Tuigim go maith na dúshláin atá ann i gceantair Ghaeltachta tithíocht a chur ar fáil ar phraghas réasúnta do dhaoine áitiúla. Is dúshlán é seo a ghabhann níos leithne ná an Ghaeltacht féin ach tuigim go mór an brú atá ar cheantair Ghaeltachta. Agus é sin ráite, níl sé i gceist ag mo Roinn ag an bpointe seo na scéimeanna tithíochta faoi Achtanna na dTithe (Gaeltachta), a cuireadh ar athló roinnt blianta ó shin, a thabhairt ar ais. Ó cuireadh na scéimeanna sin ar athló, tá scéimeanna eile bunaithe ag an Rialtas le tacú leo siúd atá ag iarraidh tithe a cheannach nó a thógáil. Mar go bhfuil na tacaíochtaí atá ar fáil faoi na scéimeanna nua seo níos flaithiúla ó thaobh airgid de ná na scéimeanna tithíochta faoi Achtanna na dTithe (Gaeltachta), is é tuairim mheáite mo Roinne nach bhfuil gá iad a athsheoladh ag an bpointe seo.  Tá an méid atá geallta i bplean tithíochta an Rialtais don Ghaeltacht soiléir. Anuas ar na scéimeanna tacaíochta náisiúnta a bheidh ar fáil don phobal i gcoitinne, tá sé geallta go bhfoilseofar ráiteas náisiúnta pleanála don Ghaeltacht sa chéad leath de 2027 agus go n-oibreoidh Údarás na Gaeltachta i gcomhar le hUisce Éireann agus na húdaráis áitiúla chun na féidearthachtaí a bhaineann le suíomhanna seirbhísithe a bheadh feiliúnach do thithíocht a fhiosrú. Anuas air sin, tabharfaidh an Bille um Údarás na Gaeltachta (Leasú), 2024 cumhachtaí nua d'Údarás na Gaeltachta talamh a chur ar fáil ó phunann maoine na heagraíochta le haghaidh tithíochta do chainteoirí Gaeilge i gceantair Ghaeltachta.  Ó thaobh lóistín turasóireachta gearrthéarmach de, cuirfidh an Bille um ligean gearrthéarmach agus turasóireacht bonn reachtúil ar chóras nua clárúcháin le haghaidh ligean gearrthéarmach in Éirinn. Ní dhéanfaidh an Bille seo aon athrú ar na riachtanais phleanála atá ann cheana féin le haghaidh ligean gearrthéarmach in Éirinn, ach cabhróidh sé leis na húdaráis áitiúla na riachtanais phleanála atá ann cheana a chur i bhfeidhm ar bhonn níos éifeachtaí. Cabhróidh an Bille seo chomh maith le soiléireacht a thabhairt faoin gcuid seo de thionscal na turasóireachta agus chun a chinntiú go bhfuil sé ag feidhmiú ar bhonn inbhuanaithe. \n Deputy Aengus Ó Snodaigh  Is é an fáth gur luaigh mé Acht na dTithe (Gaeltachta) ná go n-aithníonn an chuid is mó de dhaoine gur cás ar leith í an Ghaeltacht, cé go bhfuil an chuid eile den tír i ngéarchéim thithíochta freisin. Muna bhfuil tithe ar fáil do lánúineacha agus daoine áitiúla chun cónaí iontu, ní bheidh an Ghaeltacht ann amach anseo agus ní féidir rud mar sin a atógáil in aon bhealach ceart. In 2009, tugadh €2 milliún i ndeontais faoin Acht seo. Tá sé ann agus is féidir é a dhéanamh. Dá réir, is féidir ceist eisceachtúil a dhéanamh den Ghaeilge agus cuidiú le lánúineacha atá ag triail le tithe a fháil. Ní féidir leo tithe a fháil mar níl siad ar díol. B'fhéidir go bhfuil siad á ligean ar Airbnb. Tá cás ar leith anseo. Is é seo an bealach chun infheistíocht a dhéanamh go tapa. Aithním an méid atá ag tarlú ach tá sé ag tarlú go an-mhall. \n Deputy Dara Calleary  Ar an gcéad dul síos, is é seo an fáth go bhfuil an Bille nua faoi ligean tithíochta gearrthéarmach chomh tábhachtach is atá sé. Beidh treoirlínte ag na húdaráis áitiúla. Aontaím leis an Teachta go bhfuil brú ní hamháin ar chúrsaí tithíochta sa Ghaeltacht, ach ar an teanga. Táimid ag obair ar a lán rudaí ach níl sé simplí. Caithfimid a admháil nach bhfuil sé simplí. Táim ag bualadh leis an údarás chun obair leis maidir leis an talamh atá aige ag an bpointe seo agus chun a fháil amach an bhfuil an talamh sin ullamh le haghaidh tithíocht, ní hamháin ó thaobh seirbhísí ach ó thaobh pleanála freisin. Beidh muid ag déanamh na hoibre sin leis an údarás. Tá ról mór ag na húdaráis áitiúla, na comhairlí contae, maidir leis seo freisin. Tá mé tar éis cúpla cruinniú a bheith agam le príomhfheidhmeannaigh na gcomhairlí contae sin. Beidh cruinniú eile agam i mí Eanáir chun brú a chur orthu, mar údaráis áitiúla pleanála, chun obair a dhéanamh ar an bpíosa seo. Tá na Gaeltachtaí atá i limistéir na n-údarás áitiúil sin thar a bheith tábhachtach. Caithfidh na húdaráis áitiúla, na comhairlí contae, an tábhacht sin a thuiscint. Ag an bpointe seo, tá deis leis an athbhreithniú maidir le rezoning atá ar siúl ag an bpointe seo.  Tá súil agam go dtapóidh siad an deis sin. \n Deputy Aengus Ó Snodaigh  Cloisim cad atá á rá ag an Aire ach tá frustrachas ar mhuintir na Gaeltachta toisc go raibh siad ag siúl le treoirlínte pleanála Gaeltachta. Tá na treoirlínte sin tar éis bás a fháil. Tá an tAire ag caint faoi ráiteas anois a thiocfaidh agus a bheidh ag dul amach go comhairliúchán. Tá sé ag caint faoi bhlianta eile. Is an rud céanna é faoi Bhille Údarás na Gaeltachta. Níl sé rite so níl na cumhachtaí sin ag an údarás faoi láthair. Táimid fós ag fanacht air teacht ar ais le go gcríochnóimid iad. Nílimid ag iarraidh go mbeadh aon mhoill air. Tá gá go mbeadh na rudaí seo ag tarlú anois mar is é seo an áit atá an fhadhb. An fáth go bhfuil mé ag cur na ceiste faoin Acht ar leith seo ná gur bealach tapa é seo fad is atáimid ag fanacht ar na céimeanna eile. Mura dtarlaíonn sé sin, beidh sáinn ann. Beidh BÁNÚ, an eagraíocht atá ag tabhairt tacaíochta do cheantair Ghaeltachta maidir le tithíocht, ag éirí níos mó. Tá an ceart ag an Aire go bhfuil ról ag na comhairlí contae. Ach anois láithreach, cá bhfuil Bille Údarás na Gaeltachta? Cá bhfuil na cumhachtaí? Cá bhfuil an gníomh chun déileáil leis an gceist éigeandála seo ó thaobh na Gaeltachta anois láithreach? \n Deputy Dara Calleary  Beimid ar ais ag an mBille go luath san earrach. Roimh an mBille sin, tá mé ag obair leis an údarás. Níl mé i mo shuí ansin. Tá mé ag obair chun go mbeidh tuiscint idir mé féin agus an t-údarás faoi stádas pleanála na talún atá aige i ngach chuid den Ghaeltacht. Níl aon fhadhb agam cumhachtaí a thabhairt don údarás don talamh atá aige ag an bpointe seo ach tá sé tábhachtach go dtuigfimid céard é stádas na talún sin ag an bpointe seo agus cén athruithe atá déanta. Níl aon phointe cumhacht a thabhairt don údarás murar féidir leis an chumhacht sin a úsáid mar gheall ar chúrsaí pleanála nó aon rialachán a bheidh ar an talamh sin. Táim sásta é sin a phlé leis an Teachta Ó Snodaigh nó leis an Teachta McGuinness i rith mí Eanáir chun go mbeidh tuiscint ar an sórt treo ina bhfuilimid ag dul. ",

HSE decisions on which medicines are reimbursed by the taxpayer are made on objective, scientific and economic grounds.  There are formal processes which govern applications for the pricing and reimbursement of medicines, and new uses of existing medicines, to be funded and / or reimbursed.  The HSE considers the following criteria prior to making any decision on pricing / reimbursement in line with the Health (Pricing and Supply of Medical Goods) Act 2013:  (1) The health needs of the public,  (2) The cost effectiveness of meeting health needs by supplying the item concerned rather than providing other health services,  (3) The availability and suitability of items for supply or reimbursement,  (4) The proposed costs, benefits, and risks of the item or listed item relative to therapeutically similar items or listed items provided in other health service settings and the level of certainty in relation to the evidence of those costs, benefits and risks,  (5) The potential or actual budget impact of the item or listed item,  (6) The clinical need for the item or listed item,  (7) The appropriate level of clinical supervision required in relation to the item to ensure patient safety,  (8) The efficacy (performance in trial), effectiveness (performance in real situations) and added therapeutic benefit against existing standards of treatment (how much better it treats a condition than existing therapies), and  (9) The resources available to the HSE.  In terms of the specific details of the application for pricing and reimbursement of selpercatinib (Retsevmo®):   Medullary Thyroid Cancer   • The HSE received a complete application for pricing and reimbursement on the 27th June 2025 from Eli Lilly (the applicant) for selpercatinib (Retsevmo®) indicated for adults and adolescents 12 years and older with advanced rearranged during transfection (RET)-mutant medullary thyroid cancer (MTC) (HTA ID 25034a).  • Further information on the progress of selpercatinib (Retsevmo®) through the HSE assessment and approval processes for the above indication is available via the Pricing and Reimbursement Application tracker available at: www.hse.ie/eng/about/who/cpu/. [ ]HSE application ID HSE100051 has been assigned to this application.   Thyroid Cancer   • The HSE received a complete application for pricing and reimbursement on the 27th June 2025 from Eli Lilly for selpercatinib (Retsevmo®) indicated for adults and adolescents 12 years and older with advanced RET fusion-positive thyroid cancer (TC) who are radioactive iodine-refractory (if radioactive iodine is appropriate) (HTA ID 25034b).  • Further information on the progress of selpercatinib (Retsevmo®) through the HSE assessment and approval processes for the above indication is available via the Pricing and Reimbursement Application tracker available at: www.hse.ie/eng/about/who/cpu/. HSE application ID HSE100052 has been assigned to this application.   NSCLC   • The HSE received a complete application for pricing and reimbursement on the 27th June 2025 from Eli Lilly for selpercatinib (Retsevmo®) indicated as monotherapy for the treatment of adult patients with advanced RET fusion-positive non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) not previously treated with a RET inhibitor (HTA ID 25035).  • Further information on the progress of selpercatinib (Retsevmo®) through the HSE assessment and approval processes for the above indication is available via the Pricing and Reimbursement Application tracker available at: www.hse.ie/eng/about/who/cpu/. HSE application ID HSE100050 has been assigned to this application.  These applications remain under consideration with the HSE. The HSE cannot make any comment on possible outcomes from the ongoing process.  The HSE operates the EU Treatment Abroad Scheme (TAS), for persons entitled under EU Regulation 883/04. The TAS is a consultant led scheme and allows for an Ireland-based public consultant to refer a public patient who is normally resident in Ireland for treatment in the public healthcare system of another EU member state, the UK or Switzerland. Subject to the EU Regulations and Guidelines, the TAS provides for the cost of approved public treatments in another EU/EEA member state, the UK or Switzerland through the issue of form S2 (IE) where the treatment is:  • among the benefits provided for by Irish legislation;  • not available in Ireland;  • not available within the time normally necessary for obtaining it in Ireland, taking account of the patient's current state of health and the probable course of the disease;  • medically necessary and will meet the patient’s needs;  • a proven form of medical treatment and not experimental or test treatment;  • provided in a recognised public hospital or other institution that will accept EU/EEA form S2 (IE) and;  • is under the control of a registered medical practitioner.

The Act provides that housing authorities have statutory responsibility for the assessment of the accommodation needs of Travellers and the preparation, adoption and implementation of multi-annual Traveller Accommodation Programmes (TAPs) in their areas.  My Department is committed to supporting Dublin City Council in the redevelopment of Labre Park. In April 2016, a Stage 1 application for the redevelopment of this site was submitted to my Department, and in September 2016, my Department granted approval for a budget provision of €8.7 million. In July 2019, a Stage 2 application was received by my Department and approval was granted subsequently for funding of €13.2 million.  In December 2022, a revised Stage 2 application was received by my Department. In February 2023, further information requested by my Department was submitted by the local authority and subsequently in July 2023 my Department granted approval for an increased overall budget provision of €16.7m for the redevelopment of Labre Park.  My Department provided this funding approval for the redevelopment of accommodation at Labre Park to support the long-term strategy for this site to provide quality accommodation to the residents which will address the current conditions on the site.  My Department met with Dublin City Council most recently in September 2025 to discuss the planned redesign and regeneration of Labre Park. Subsequently, in November 2025, Dublin City Council submitted a further revised Stage 2 application for funding to my Department and this is currently under consideration. ",

Foráladh le hAlt 28 den Acht um Pleanáil agus Forbairt 2000 go bhféadfadh an tAire Tithíochta, Rialtais Áitiúil agus Oidhreachta treoirlínte a eisiúint d’údaráis phleanála maidir le haon cheann dá bhfeidhmeanna faoin Acht agus go raibh sé de dhualgas ar údaráis phleanála aird a thabhairt ar na treoirlínte sin agus iad i mbun a bhfeidhmeanna.

        "answerText": " Tánaiste and Minister for Finance  In response to the Deputy’s question, he should first note that while I have responsibility for the Residential Zoned Land Tax, my colleague the Minister for Housing Local Government and Heritage has responsibility for the vacant site levy. Therefore, my officials sought material for this reply on the latter issue from the Department of Housing Local Government and Heritage.  Firstly, I will cover the Residential Zoned Land Tax issue. Finance Act 2021 introduced Part 22A Residential Zoned Land Tax (RZLT) into the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997. RZLT is designed to prompt residential development by owners of land that satisfies the relevant criteria for the tax, that being that the land is zoned for residential or mixed-use (including residential) purposes and that is serviced.  RZLT is an annual tax, calculated at a rate of 3% of the market value of the land within its scope. The tax was first charged in 2025 in respect of land which satisfied the relevant criteria in 2022. The first RZLT liability arose on 1 February 2025 and was payable in May 2025, subject to certain exemptions and deferrals. The 2026 liability will arise on 1 February 2026 and is payable by 23 May 2026.  The legislation underpinning RZLT requires local authorities to consider whether land satisfies the relevant criteria for the tax, being that the land in question is zoned for residential use, serviced and not otherwise excluded from the relevant criteria, and to prepare and publish maps identifying land within the scope of the tax. These maps are updated annually for any changes in the zoning and servicing status of the land which has already been included on such maps, to reflect any additional land which falls within the scope of the tax and to exclude any land that has fallen outside the scope of the tax.  Draft revised maps are published by local authorities by 1 February each year and owners of land appearing on draft revised maps are provided with an opportunity to make submissions regarding whether their land satisfies the relevant criteria and the date from which it satisfied the criteria. If a local authority determines that land subject to such a submission does satisfy the relevant criteria for inclusion on the draft revised map, the legislation affords the landowner an opportunity to appeal the local authority determination to An Coimisiún Pleanála.  The tax is charged in respect of land included on revised maps published by local authorities by 31 January in the year after the publication of the draft revised maps, which reflect the outcome of the submissions and appeals processes. The Deputy should note that I have no influence over this process.  In relation to the vacant site levy the Minister for Housing Local Government and Heritage has advised that under Section 30 of the Planning and Development Act 2000, he is precluded from exercising any power or control in relation to any particular case with which a planning authority is or may be concerned.  He has further advised that under the vacant site levy provisions in the Urban Regeneration and Housing Act 2015 (the Act), planning authorities were empowered to apply a vacant site levy of 3% of the market valuation of relevant properties which were listed on local authority vacant site registers in 2018, which relevant owners were liable to pay in January 2019. The rate of the levy increased to 7% for sites listed on local authority vacant sites registers from 2019 onwards which site owners became liable to pay in January of the following year. Under Section 19 of the Act, unpaid levies due remain a charge on the land in question until they are paid and the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage (DHLGH) continues to engage with local authorities to ensure that all vacant site levies due are paid.  DHLGH requests annual progress reports from local authorities in respect of the Vacant Site Levy. The information provided annually by each local authority is as follows - the value of sites liable, the number and value of demand letters issued, the value and number of sites for which payments were collected, the value and number of sites for which payments are outstanding etc.  DHLGH recently issued Circular Letter SPI 02-2025 to local authorities requesting the submission of a further progress report on the implementation and collection of the levy in respect of the year 2024. It should be noted that local authorities do not provide a breakdown on individual properties and granular details on individual properties is a matter for the relevant local authority.  Finally, the Deputy should be aware that the Government is strongly committed to the use of vacant or underutilised state land for housing. In this regard the Minister for Housing Local Government and Heritage has advised there has been agreement to the transfer to date of 37 sites to the Land Development Agency (LDA) to develop social and affordable housing. The Digital Hub site, currently occupied by the Digital Hub Development Agency (DHDA) was agreed for transfer by Government under Housing for All. The LDA is currently at advanced planning stage on the initial enabling works application which will form the basis of the overall regeneration of this 3.7-hectare site, called Pear Tree Crossing. Approximately 570 homes are planned, and the site will also include a vibrant mix of commercial, cultural, and community facilities.  Agreement is in place between the DHDA and the LDA, and the process to effect the legal transfer of the site is currently underway. ",

As a state body, meeting its running costs is a matter in the first instance for the agency. As its commercial income has been insufficient to meet all its running costs, my Department has, since its establishment advanced Exchequer funding in order that it may pay costs as they fall due for payment. This will continue to be the case.  The Government decided in 2021 that the DHDA is to be dissolved, and all its properties transferred to the Land Development Agency (LDA) to support the development of affordable housing. Last year the LDA indicated that it only required certain properties, including the DHDA’s derelict sites, for housing.  The transfer of these properties is being expedited. ",

        "answerText": " Minister for Health  I propose to take Questions Nos. 879, 905, 906, 907, 931, 932, 933 and 934 together.  The Community Pharmacy Agreement 2025 was published on the 18th of September 2025, following the successful conclusion of negotiations with the Irish Pharmacy Union (IPU). The Agreement is supported by a €75 million new investment across 2025 and 2026.  The Agreement marks a significant milestone in the strategic collaboration between the Department of Health, the Health Service Executive (HSE), and the IPU. It sets out a comprehensive and ongoing pathway to modernise and expand the role of community pharmacy in Ireland’s healthcare system.  The Agreement is available on the Department of Health’s website at the following link: www.gov.ie/en/department-of-health/publications/community-pharmacy-agreement-2025/.  It is important to note that the Community Pharmacy Agreement 2025 does not remove phased dispensing.  Phased dispensing was introduced in 1996 for patient safety reasons. The supply of medication in instalments can support patients prescribed certain high-risk medications who are at risk of medication misadventure if these medications were to be supplied monthly, as is the norm under the community drug schemes. Where a phased dispensing claim is submitted, the current requirement is that an item must be dispensed in the pharmacy across multiple supply occasions. Community pharmacies receive additional payments in respect of phased dispensing.  Monitored Dosing Systems are systems that enable the individual medicine doses to be organised according to the prescribed dose schedule. These are sometimes referred to as blister packs. The State has never agreed to fund Monitored Dosing Systems.  However, a practice has built up whereby the use of Monitored Dosing Systems are charged as if for phased dispensing. The State has never agreed to this. Phased claiming was never intended to be used to submit claims in lieu of the provision of Monitored Dosing Systems.  Whilst Monitored Dosing Systems may have a role for some patients there is significant uncertainty around the robustness of the evidence supporting its use. The National Centre for Pharmacoeconomics carried out an evidence assessment which indicated that the evidence was, at best, equivocal to support such a programme.  Significant expenditure is therefore being incurred where it was never intended by the State. It has been agreed to introduce improved controls in this regard and to limit the use of phased dispensing to specified high risk drugs, where a patient safety concern may exist.  Phased dispensing support is currently available for medical card holders under the General Medical Services (GMS) Scheme for the following reasons:  Reason 1 - at the request of a patient's physician.  Reason 2 - due to the inherent nature of a medicinal product i.e. product stability and shelf life.  Reason 3 - where a patient is commencing new drug therapy with a view to establishing patient tolerance and acceptability before continuing on a full treatment regime.  Reason 4 - in exceptional circumstances where the patient is incapable of safely and effectively managing the medication regimen.  Under the Community Pharmacy Agreement 2025, from January 2026, phased dispensing under reason 1 and 4 will be limited to a defined set of high-risk medication classes. These are:  Psychotropics;  Opioids;  Codeine;  Pregabalin and gabapentin.  The approved list of medications under these classes will be provided by the HSE in due course.  For reasons 1 and 4, by focusing phased dispensing reimbursement on the medication categories on the approved list, phased dispensing payments can be targeted to medications with the highest risk or potential for misuse.  Phased dispensing fees will remain payable as per current arrangements under reasons 2 and 3 and will not be subject to the approved list.  The salient point here is that appropriate phased dispensing is not being removed in this Agreement.  The introduction of improved controls around phased dispensing is being done in a way which puts patient safety first and allows the State to repurpose €20m of funding to be used to implement new patient-centred services.  It remains open to pharmacies to charge patients for the use of Monitored Dosing Systems as a private service. ",

        "answerText": " Deputy Aengus Ó Snodaigh  This question is prompted by the situation the Ireland women's national basketball team found itself in because it was forced to play against an aggressor nation team, namely, Israel. The question relates to the details of the engagement the Department had with Basketball Ireland over the past six months while this topic was being discussed. \n Minister of State at the Department of Culture, Communications and Sport (Deputy Charlie McConalogue)  I thank the Deputy for his question. While I have not met with Basketball Ireland over the past six months, I did meet with it in April for an introductory meeting regarding its development and other plans. I understand the question relates to playing of matches against Israel. In this regard, the draw for the 2027 Women's Euro Basket qualification group which placed Ireland in a group with Bosnia and Herzegovina, Israel and Luxembourg took place in July. I spoke on the phone to the CEO of Basketball Ireland who updated me on that at that point. Of course, it is important to make clear, as I would have outlined at that stage as well, that the Government and Sport Ireland have no role in determining the participation by national governing bodies of sport in international competitions organised by international sporting federations. National governing bodies of sport, NGBs, and international sporting federations, the International Basketball Federation, FIBA, in the case of basketball, are independent, autonomous bodies responsible for the governance of their own sports, including the organisation of sporting fixtures.  Regarding the topic of athlete safeguarding, Sport Ireland works with NGBs to ensure that appropriate policies are put in place to take a proactive approach to safeguarding by identifying and mitigating risks to athlete welfare. It also works with NGBs to ensure mechanisms are in place to appropriately deal with matters that may arise.  On a wider note, I can say that Ireland welcomes the agreement on the first phase of the 20-point plan to end the war in Gaza. The first phase of the plan, the ceasefire and hostage release agreement, is an important step on a road to peace. Our immediate focus must be on ensuring humanitarian aid into and throughout Gaza at scale. Ireland stands ready to play its part in working towards a sustainable peace between Israel and Palestine through the implementation of the two-state solution. \n Deputy Aengus Ó Snodaigh  I presume the Minister of State would have been aware, or at least Basketball Ireland would have made him aware, of the predicament it was in and what it was facing in terms of playing an international fixture and that it was being threatened with fines up to €180,000 if it did not go ahead with such a match. This is despite the fact the international governing body for the sport, FIBA, had taken a different stance with regard to Ukraine and Russia in 2022. In fact, Basketball Ireland was ahead of the game because it had indicated at that stage it would not play Russia ahead of the international body. However, in this instance, the international body was threatening Ireland with huge fines if it did not go ahead with a fixture that was scheduled against the team. Was the Minister of State aware of that and what action or support did he give to Basketball Ireland and the women being faced with this match? \n Deputy Charlie McConalogue  As was outlined in my response, it is a matter for the national governing bodies and international sporting organisations to make their own decisions in this regard. From the point of view of the Government, it does not have a role in any individual sporting organisation's decisions. However, when it comes to the issue of Gaza, the Government has led out internationally and has taken a very strong and forthright line and approach regarding the war and the destruction that happened in Gaza. As well as seeking an outcome that will deliver peace, the Government was very much to the fore in leading out on recognising Palestine as a state, which many other states subsequently have done, and also in pursuing the occupied territories Bill, which a number of other states have now indicated they will follow. That is the approach the State has taken in relation to the war in Palestine. Regarding sporting organisations and their decisions to participate or otherwise in international competitions, that is entirely a matter for them. \n Deputy Aengus Ó Snodaigh  We can have a discussion about Israel and genocide but that is not the purpose of this. International fixtures against genocidal nations is not a matter for the national sporting bodies alone. If Ireland had taken a stronger stance, and if the sporting body had gone ahead with a fixture against the Government's position then, I think, the Minister of State would have a different approach here. However, the match went ahead and, regrettably, the Irish team lost but there is a further match in March of next year. There is still time for Ireland to take a stance and to indicate to Basketball Ireland that it has the support of the Government in supporting the women playing for Ireland who did not want to play this fixture because of threats and intimidation from the other team and, in particular, because of the sporting boycott, which is a worldwide phenomenon at the moment against Israel. I thank Irish Sport for Palestine for its laudable work in profiling this case. \n Deputy Charlie McConalogue  As a Government, Ireland has taken a very strong line in leading out and opposing what was happening in Gaza. I have already outlined that. However, the matter of participating in international competitions or otherwise is a matter for sporting organisations. That has always been the case and that will remain the case. It is not appropriate for the Government to get involved in an independent organisation's decision in that regard. That is the approach the Government will continue to take. I know the match took place in Riga, Latvia. Basketball Ireland had engaged with the international body given the fact it felt it was not safe for the match to take place in Israel given the backdrop. The match took place and the Irish team acquitted itself very well in that competition. It went to extra time and the team lost. However, the decision to participate or otherwise is entirely a matter for the national governing body. ",

The redevelopment of the Crawford Art Gallery is a challenging and complex project that requires a combination of conservation and new-build elements on a restricted city centre site. The original estimate at preliminary business case stage was arrived at in 2020, prior to the planning and design phase, and the project has changed substantially since then. There has also been considerable construction inflation of just under 40% since 2020.  In 2024, the project went out to tender in the market. Following the outcome of the tender process to determine the main contractor, integrated design team and reserved specialists, the overall project budget estimate for the Crawford development is now €93.1 million, including VAT. To date, €6.5 million has been spent to bring the project through to this stage. This figure covers investigative surveys, design costs, the costs of decanting the art works and getting the art works into storage. The remaining capital costs are estimated at €86.6 million.  In line with the infrastructure guidelines, the final business case has been completed. As part of this process, there was a reappraisal of all options to deliver this key project. It found the proposed option remains the best to redevelop the gallery on a cost and quality basis. To proceed with the redevelopment now is the most direct, timely and cost-effective way to deliver a new and revitalised Crawford Art Gallery that will be a landmark artistic and cultural amenity in the centre of Cork city and bring to conclusion a project that has been planned for many years. The contractor is expected to be on site in early 2026 and the project will be completed in 2028. The gallery fit-out, commissioning and reoccupation will follow prior to opening. \n Deputy Aengus Ó Snodaigh  Initially, the contractor was supposed to have been selected at the start of this year. What is the delay? Is the contractor signed, sealed and guaranteed to start work now that the gallery is closed? The Obelisk of Bronze by Michael Warren was removed recently, which signalled the closure of the gallery for three years. As the Minister said, in 2020 the estimated cost was €28 million. What is the point in having an estimated cost if no design work or proper planning is done? We have now arrived at a figure of €93 million. It is a good investment and I am not arguing that we should not spend the money, but the figure was €28 million in 2020 and there has been a big jump since. Has the project substantially changed from that which was projected to cost €28 million? \n Deputy Patrick O'Donovan  The Deputy is quite right; there have been delays. We are now in a position whereby the contractor will be in place in January and it is to be hoped the project will be completed in 2028. The Deputy omitted to say, perhaps in error, that in the intervening period since the preliminary business case was completed, inflation in the construction sector has been running at 40% or more. It is a complicated and challenging site. It is a city centre site and heritage building. It is not straightforward. As with all of these things, there are elements that come to light after the fact that would not necessarily have been to the fore until the detailed design was initiated.  There is a significant cost differential. My Department has guidelines we have to adhere to. Those guidelines were adhered to. No moneys were expended prior to the initial response I gave a while ago, when I made reference to the figure of €6.5 million. We are now in a position, thanks to a Government decision arrived at in the past fortnight, to proceed. The Crawford Art Gallery is the only national cultural institution wholly outside of the city of Dublin and represents a massive part of our national development plan allocation in its entirety. \n Deputy Aengus Ó Snodaigh  Perhaps we will address the fact that it is the only cultural institution outside of Dublin in the future and can examine how to make sure there are other national institutions outside of Dublin rather than concentrate all of them in one city. Costs have increased substantially. The gallery renovation will add an extra 50% in terms of space for exhibitions and so on. A lot of work will be done to make the gallery accessible in the future. Even a 40% increase in construction inflation would only bring the cost to €40 million.  What exactly are the changes in the design or refurbishment that brought about such a substantial jump? It is a good investment and I have absolutely no problem with the figure. However, when a project is announced with a particular cost, the public starts to believe that is the amount it will cost until, all of a sudden, a new figure is announced. This makes us, as politicians, look a bit stupid. \n Deputy Patrick O'Donovan  Nobody wants to go out of his or her way to look stupid. The reality, as the Deputy knows as well as I do, is that when one goes under the bonnet of buildings like Leinster House, for example, one finds in the detailed design and in the final planning, as I saw in previous Departments I was in, that sometimes the depth of the problems associated with heritage buildings, in particular, is only discovered after the fact. I have made clear that I am not happy there is such a differential in the cost. The planning and design phase has led to the project changing considerably. I can get the Deputy the exact details on what has been added to the scope of works since the plan that was originally anticipated.  I welcome the Deputy's comment that we should see more NCIs outside Dublin. There is only one element of the National Museum of Ireland, for instance, outside Dublin, that being in County Mayo. There is an opportunity now under the NDP to see how we can incorporate something similar in other regions of the country. ",

Deputy Aengus Ó Snodaigh asked the Minister for Culture, Communications and Sport the breakdown of the projected spend of €93 million by the State in hosting seven games of the Euro 2028 soccer tournament; and if additional funding will be given to local soccer clubs to increase participation in the sport and improve facilities in advance of the tournament.

        "answerText": " Deputy Aengus Ó Snodaigh  I seek a breakdown of the projected State expenditure of €93 million on hosting the Euro 2028 soccer games. It is a welcome investment that will result, I hope, in greater investment in the sport. I am interested in what the breakdown is and how soccer clubs and communities around the country will benefit. \n Deputy Charlie McConalogue  Euro 2028 is a really exciting opportunity for Ireland to co-host, along with England, Scotland and Wales, an internationally important soccer championship. We will host seven games in the competition, including a quarter-final. The Government will invest just over €92.9 million in supporting the event. It is anticipated the tournament will generate €449 million of socioeconomic benefits for the country.  The main elements of the expected expenditure include funding for stadium costs, safety and security, including Garda costs, transport, fan zones, Dublin City Council costs, sustainability investment and legacy programmes. The funding will be delivered through my Department, other Departments, Dublin City Council and relevant agencies. Furthermore, €6.2 million of our overall investment is ring-fenced for legacy initiatives and Ireland's national plan in this regard, which is being developed in consultation with the FAI. The legacy plan will focus on initiatives to increase participation and aims to ensure every child, regardless of background, gender or ability, can participate in football.  The expenditure of €93 million is made up of: €7.7 million for the Aviva Stadium upgrade and overlay; €2.1 million for central administration, transport and mobility; €5.7 million for fan zones; €10.6 million for other costs; €6.3 million for Dublin City Council costs; €37 million for safety and security; €6 million for the legacy programme; and €7.5 million for a general programme-level contingency. I can provide the Deputy with a breakdown of other, smaller items of expenditure. \n Deputy Aengus Ó Snodaigh  As I said, this investment is welcome, and also welcome is the fact it will generate a return of €400 million-plus. I recognise that a huge amount of money must be spent on security, Dublin City Council, etc. Out of the full €93 million, the €6 million on the legacy plan seems paltry. I encourage the Government to invest more or a greater portion of the allocation in that. In the past, the FAI and the League of Ireland have set out a vision for facilities investment, with the aim of helping clubs at the very lowest level to improve their dressing rooms, especially, and extend dressing rooms to enable more girls to play. I recognise that the Government has taken some steps on this but I ask that further investment be made out of this pot of money. \n Deputy Charlie McConalogue  I take this opportunity to congratulate the Irish soccer team on its wonderful performance last Sunday and on the Thursday before that. Football has given us some of our best national memories over the years. The recent matches, particularly the one on Sunday, provided, once again, wonderful national moments that brought the whole country together and brought great energy and excitement. I wish the team well in the draw taking place this afternoon for the play-offs that will be held in March. I congratulate, in particular, Troy Parrott, who gave a performance for the ages. Scoring five goals over two games is absolutely exceptional and a great credit to him. Credit also goes to the wider team for coming together, to Heimir Hallgrímsson for his leadership and to the FAI as well. We look forward to the excitement in the months ahead as we build up to the play-offs. I also congratulate our neighbours in Scotland. I did not think the end of Ireland's match on Sunday could be topped but, by God, it was some finish to the Scottish game. I congratulate the Scottish players on their qualification.  I take Deputy O Snodaigh's point. We have €6 million for the legacy plan and we want to make sure it has an impact and improves participation. That certainly is our objective. \n Deputy Aengus Ó Snodaigh  I concur with everything the Minister of State said. Troy Parrott is an example to us all that if there is investment in sports, especially in areas that are disadvantaged, it can bring about huge changes in people's lives. That is why I am encouraging greater investment in the facilities programme of the FAI and the League of Ireland to ensure we get the best out of our youths and we do not end up with youths having to go abroad for academies and the like. I know from my own family of younger kids who had to go abroad to avail of the best standards in terms of academies.  I understand a delivery company was set up for some of this. I hope it will be able to deliver. When the Special Olympics were held here in 2003, there were hosts and host areas. I do not know whether that is being considered for Euro 2028 as all the matches are concentrated in Dublin. However, that does not mean all the investment must be concentrated in Dublin. \n Deputy Charlie McConalogue  I will be looking to see how we can maximise the benefit across the country. Young Troy Parrott is a wonderful example of the quality of young players we have in this country. That is something the Government is backing. As the Deputy knows, we stepped up very significantly in the recent budget by allocating €3 million to the development of football academies for the year ahead. We want to build on that. We recognise the changed circumstances post Brexit and the importance of making sure young players have the opportunity to maximise their potential within the country. We see the benefit of having those young players in the League of Ireland. We are seeing a renaissance and a flourishing in the League of Ireland, with some of those wonderful young players starring in that. We want to ensure that as many young people as possible have every opportunity through the academy system. The Government is committed to doing that. \n Deputy Aengus Ó Snodaigh  An extra €10 million or €20 million would not go astray. \n Deputy Charlie McConalogue  We have made a massive start and it has been very much welcomed within the footballing community. We look forward to seeing it reap benefits in the time ahead. ",

        "answerText": " Deputy Aengus Ó Snodaigh  I did not think we would get to this question but some of it has been discussed with the Minister of State in the context of investment in sport and where we finished off discussing Euro 2028. I am asking whether the city, neighbouring towns and communities and sports clubs can host fans and the international teams and create events similar to what happen during the Special Olympics in 2003. \n Deputy Charlie McConalogue  We discussed this in good detail earlier, but the objective will be to ensure there is as much of a legacy and impact across the country from the hosting of Euro 2028 as possible. Being able to host seven games as part of the tournament, including the quarter final, is a great opportunity. I have no doubt it will really take hold of the country over the course of the period. As I said, we estimate the cost at €92 million to €93 million. The economic return to the wider economy will be much more significant than that and it makes a lot of sense from that point of view but we also want to ensure there is a return in the form of an impact on participation in football and sport generally and that we maximise that as much as we can. We are just under three years away from the hosting of that tournament. We are engaging in very strong detail with other organisations and national agencies to make sure it impacts as strongly as possible. We are also engaging with the FAI on discussions about the legacy piece and how we can best maximise the impact of that. I certainly hope we will have another football tournament to participate in between now and then, depending on how the play-offs go in March, but Euro 2028 is a very exciting opportunity for the country. We will work across the board with all stakeholders to make sure we maximise the impact of it in every way possible. \n Deputy Aengus Ó Snodaigh  Gabhaim buíochas leis an Aire Stáit. We have an opportunity. While €93 million has been committed it is 2028 so there is an opportunity to add to that. The Government has committed to the €93 million. We know what the return is but between now and 2028 greater investment can be put into local clubs and communities to ensure we get the greatest benefit for Dublin and outside the city as well because even though the matches are being held here, this is the world stage. We need to ensure that similar to other large sporting events that have been held in Ireland in the past, and will be held shortly, we will be on the world stage and need to ensure that not just what happens on the pitch but what happens outside it works well. There is need for a greater investment. \n Deputy Charlie McConalogue  We are certainly determined, from a Government point of view, to maximise the opportunity and to ensure from a point of view of participation that every opportunity is taken to ensure it cuts through and gets people involved in football and other sport. The commitment of the Government in the most recent budget to football and the establishment of academies speaks to how we have been supporting football very strongly in the country. While at Government level will be doing all we can, there is no doubt moments like last weekend and the inspiration provided by Troy Parrott and the rest of the team encourage participation and young people. I recall watching matches in tournaments in the past and I would be bursting out the door afterwards, even if I was on my own, to hit the ball. That is the type of thing that really cuts through and inspires and energise people to participate in sport. From a Government point of view, in terms of the investment and policy structure, we will be doing all we can to maximise that and provide the opportunity for people to participate and engage. \n Deputy Aengus Ó Snodaigh  We have a once-in-a-lifetime - though maybe not in a lifetime - opportunity to enhance Ireland's reputation.  In one small area of Dublin city, the north inner city, which has had bad press in recent times, Troy Parrott, Kellie Harrington and people like them have shown that, even when conditions are adverse, sports can shine through. The more we invest in sports and in those communities, the more we will see great sportspeople into the future, whom we can all follow and use to encourage other young people into sport. In an earlier response, the Minister of State mentioned that Dublin City Council will get about €6 million out of this. Again, I encourage him to look at that funding again and to increase it to ensure that the Dublin region as a whole and areas outside of it can get more from the investment. \n Deputy Charlie McConalogue  We should not forget the support that we have given to football over the past number of years, which we continue to give. Some €75 million was allocated to the FAI between 2019 and 2024, with €30 million specifically to support football development aimed at promoting participation by young people. That has been added to in the most recent budget through the investment in the academies and the very significant ongoing investment through the community sports facilities fund, which supports the work of soccer clubs right across the country in developing their facilities, and through the large scale sport infrastructure fund, through which we have made significant commitments to the development of Dalymount Park, Wexford Youths' stadium, Sligo Rovers' grounds and, significantly, Finn Harps' Finn Park in Donegal. That is something we have been doing and that we continue to do. We now want to make sure the opportunity provided by Euro 2028 adds to that very significantly in a way that lasts into the future. ",

While the detail of the future scheme will need to be agreed by Government, this is a major milestone for the arts in Ireland and I am particularly pleased that the research my Department conducted provided Government with a clear evidence base upon which to make that decision.  The cost of the Basic Income for the Arts (BIA) pilot scheme was €35m for a full calendar year for 2,000 artists to participate, with each recipient receiving €325 a week. There were over 8,200 eligible applicants to the pilot scheme in 2022. To have funded all those eligible at that rate would have cost approximately €139m per year.  The research has consistently demonstrated both the positive impact the BIA has had for those in receipt of it and how difficult it is to work as an artist in Ireland given the income precarity prevalent in the sector. The BIA successor scheme will help to sustain the careers of those artists who will receive it and retain their talent in the arts sector.  With an allocation of €18.27m in my Department’s 2026 Estimate, I look forward to the design and delivery of the successor scheme next year.  I can confirm that the BIA pilot scheme will end in February 2026, which is when the final pilot payment will be made to the current cohort of recipients. While eligibility is not yet finalised, a new cohort of recipients will be selected based on eligible applications for the successor scheme, so therefore it will not be the same 2,000 recipients.  Stakeholder consultation and engagement with other relevant Government Departments on the design of the new scheme is ongoing to determine details such as the duration, eligibility and selection method, the details of which have not yet been decided. Once the parameters of the scheme have been agreed by Government I intend to publish them. ",

        "answerText": " Minister for Education and Youth  I propose to take Questions Nos. 424, 425 and 426 together.  I can advise the Deputy that it is the current policy within the Department of Education and Youth not to endorse or promote any particular programme, product or publication to support teaching and learning. There are a small number of exceptions where the department has procured textbooks or resources in order to fill a need. There is no obligation for a school to use any particular textbook or programme in their delivery of the curriculum. Apart from a small number of prescribed texts at post-primary, determined by the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment (NCCA), the decisions on which textbooks, programmes and products to use in primary and post-primary schools are taken at school level.  In terms of content, the Department of Education and Youth does not have a role in approving, commissioning, sponsoring or endorsing any content in any publication or product. The Curriculum specification and prescribed syllabus material are determined by the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment (NCCA) www.ncca.ie and it is the responsibility of each individual school to select the resources if any that it will use to support its implementation of the curriculum.  The only requirement from the department, on any resource used in a school, is that it is relevant to the curriculum. Ultimately, the decision on which resources, if any, most appropriately covers the curriculum, rests within the school itself.  An Chomhairle um Oideachas Gaeltachta agus Gaelscolaíochta (COGG) were established under Section 31 of the Education Act 1998 and one of COGG’s key functions is the provision of teaching resources for Irish Medium schools and significant progress has been made by COGG in providing these resources that meet the needs of teachers and students in schools.  There is strong and ongoing collaboration between my department, COGG, the Council for the Curriculum, Examinations and Assessment (CCEA) in Northern Ireland, Foras na Gaeilge and other organisations that benefits education in Gaeltacht and Irish-medium settings and a wide range of resources are available as a result.  My department has provided funding of just over €3m to COGG in 2025 and additional staff have been approved to further support and enhance its role, particularly to support the implementation of the new Policy on Irish-Medium Education outside the Gaeltacht and the new Action Plan to support the teaching and learning experiences of Irish in English-medium schools. €1m of COGG’s annual budget is put towards providing teaching and learning resources, and this includes new textbooks in Irish.  Since 2020, COGG has been developing ‘An Tairseach’ a portal which provides access to teaching and learning resources for Gaeltacht and Irish-medium schools. Teachers produce resources for ‘An Tairseach’, which are quality assured prior to their publication. Notes and resources for the majority of Junior and Senior Cycle subjects are available online on 'An Tairseach' and COGG will continue to work with teachers to provide comprehensive notes and supporting notes in all subjects. There are currently in excess of 2,000 resources on An Tairseach, between primary and post-primary school resources.  Specifically in relation to Mathematics:  • COGG established the ‘ Meitheal an Mhata ’ working group in 2025; a collaborative group consisting of academics and representatives from Oide, the NCCA, the NCSE, and COGG itself to support the development of high-quality mathematics resources for Irish-medium schools. The group is currently consulting with teachers through a focus group and a national questionnaire circulated to primary teachers. This consultation will provide insights into teaching and learning needs arising from the redeveloped Primary Mathematics Curriculum. The findings will inform the design of a new mathematics resource, aligned with the curriculum, to enhance teaching and learning.  • The Mol Mata  website is being updated to adapt teachers’ lesson plans to reflect the changes in the new Primary Mathematics Curriculum. In addition, pupil tasks are being created for each lesson plan.  • An Irish-language version of the ‘Have You Got Maths Eyes? ’ resource pack has been developed, and copies were sent out to schools during Maths Week.  • Two new Maths Trails — one in Spiddal and one in Dublin Zoo — have been developed to highlight the curriculum’s emphasis on noticing maths in the environment and learning through play. Each trail includes questions at different levels, with a strong focus on problem-solving and reasoning. To make the trails accessible and inclusive, friendly Irish-language avatars were created to read the questions aloud. Virtual versions are also available, allowing schools across the country to take part from anywhere.  • The first edition of the STEAM-zine ‘ Full STEAM Ahead ’ has been translated into Iris; ‘Bain Triail As’ and has been sent to schools. The second edition will be ready for distribution after Christmas.  • A new series of engaging Irish-language videos, Bosa in Airde, Cúig Fhíric Iontacha , has been created by Educational Voice and COGG. Each video presents five interesting facts about a wide range of science topics and themes “from the world around us”.  • cogg.ie/an-tairseach/  • www.curriculumonline.ie/ga-ie/primary/curriculum-areas/mathematics/toolkit/  • pmc.oide.ie/ga/  • ccea.org.uk/learning-resources/mol-mata  • mathscify.org/  • haveyougotmathseyes.com/   padlet.com/eolas1/acmhainn-mata-5kpx1kmwre8s0ivm   • Many Irish-medium events were organised for Maths Week this year. Over 100 classes joined the live quiz for 1st and 2nd classes, and 126 classes took part in the ‘Maths Mystery’ online event for senior classes. A total of 184 pupils and their teachers from Gaelscoil Bharra and Gaelscoil Inse Chór visited Dublin Zoo to complete the Maths Trail at the Zoo. We received 154 entries for the tagline competition.  In line with my department's commitment to promoting the Irish language and language education actions under the 20 Year Strategy for the Irish Language 2010-2030, and the government's aim to increase the use and knowledge of Irish as a community language on an incremental basis, officials and agencies of my department remain committed to the review and reform of the learning and teaching resources for Irish-medium education.

        "answerText": " Minister of State at the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage (Deputy John Cummins)  Tá gníomh sa Phlean Tithíochta nua chun Ráiteas Pleanála Náisiúnta a fhoilsiú le haghaidh tithíochta i gceantair Ghaeltachta sa chéad leath den bhliain 2027.  Foráladh le hAlt 28 den Acht um Pleanáil agus Forbairt 2000 go bhféadfadh an tAire Tithíochta, Rialtais Áitiúil agus Oidhreachta treoirlínte a eisiúint d’údaráis phleanála maidir le haon cheann dá bhfeidhmeanna faoin Acht agus go raibh sé de dhualgas ar údaráis phleanála aird a thabhairt ar na treoirlínte sin agus iad i mbun a bhfeidhmeanna.  Aisghaireadh an t-alt sin an 2 Deireadh Fómhair 2025 de réir mar a aistríonn an córas pleanála chun feidhmiú faoi fhorálacha reachtacha nua an Achta um Pleanáil agus Forbairt 2024.  Foráiltear le hAlt 25 d’Acht 2024 do chineál nua beartais agus treorach pleanála ar a dtugtar Ráiteas Pleanála Náisiúnta. Cuireadh an fhoráil sin i bhfeidhm an 2 Deireadh Fómhair 2025 agus dá bhrí sin, eiseofar beartas agus treoir phleanála amach anseo ón Aire chuig údaráis phleanála agus is Ráiteas Pleanála Náisiúnta a bheith anseo. Tá sé beartaithe go gcuirfear Ráitis Phleanála Náisiúnta in ionad na dTreoirlínte atá ann cheana faoi alt 28, a leanfaidh de bheith i bhfeidhm go dtí go gcuirfear ina n-áit iad nó go gcúlghairmfear iad, le himeacht ama, mar aon le haon treoir nua a bhfuil sé beartaithe ag an Aire a eisiúint, le faomhadh an Rialtais.  Leagtar amach san Acht um Pleanáil agus Forbairt 2000, arna leasú, cuspóirí éigeantacha d’údaráis áitiúla, agus ní mór aghaidh a thabhairt orthu sin agus iad ag dréachtú a bPlean Forbartha lena rialaítear beartais forbartha áitiúla. I gcás ina bhfuil limistéar Gaeltachta laistigh de limistéar riaracháin an údaráis phleanála, ní mór forálacha agus cuspóirí a bheith sa phlean forbartha chun “oidhreacht theangeolaíoch agus chultúrtha na Gaeltachta a chosaint, lena n-áirítear cur chun cinn na Gaeilge mar theanga phobail”.  Tugann na Treoirlínte maidir le Pleananna Forbartha d’Údaráis Áitiúla a foilsíodh i mí Iúil 2022 treoir bhreise d’údaráis áitiúla, lena n-áirítear léiriú a thabhairt ar na Limistéir Phleanála Teanga sa Ghaeltacht (LPTanna mar a cheanglaítear faoi Acht na Gaeltachta 2012) chomh maith le beartais bhreise a áireamh amhail a chinntiú go mbíonn tionchar dearfach ag tograí forbartha i limistéir Ghaeltachta ar an oidhreacht teanga agus chultúrtha ar féidir measúnú láidir a dhéanamh orthu ag céim an iarratais phleanála.  Tá Grúpa Idir-Rannach (ar a bhfuil mo Roinnse, an Roinn Forbartha Tuaithe agus Pobail agus Gaeltachta agus Údarás na Gaeltachta) fós ag leanúint lena chuid oibre maidir le saintreoir phleanála a fhorbairt do cheantair Ghaeltachta. Tá Grúpa Oibre ar leith ann chomh maith ar a bhfuil an dá Roinn agus Údarás na Gaeltachta agus na húdaráis áitiúla ábhartha a bhaineann le ceantair Ghaeltachta. Bhí cruinnithe den Ghrúpa Idir-rannach agus den Ghrúpa Oibre ar siúl in 2023 agus lean rannpháirtíocht déthaobhach na Roinne ar aghaidh in 2024 agus 2025, agus an cruinniú is déanaí ar siúl i mí Iúil 2025.  Agus aird á tabhairt ar an ngá atá ann na nithe casta atá i gceist a bhreithniú agus a thuilleadh de rannpháirtíocht leis an Roinn Forbartha Tuaithe agus Pobail agus na Gaeltacht, déanfar measúnú ar Dhréachtráiteas Pleanála Náisiúnta críochnaithe chun críocha infheidhmeacht na Measúnachta Straitéisí Timpeallachta (MST) agus an Mheasúnaithe Chuí (MC).
