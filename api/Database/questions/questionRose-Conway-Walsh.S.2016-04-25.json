        "answerText": " The Taoiseach  I propose to take Questions Nos. 1 to 15, inclusive, together.  The Cabinet committee on housing last met yesterday, Monday, 15 December. The committee works to ensure a cross-Government approach to the implementation of our commitments regarding housing policy. This week’s meeting was specifically focused on our homelessness challenge, in particular the national housing plan commitments in this regard, including the development of a homeless prevention framework and a child and family homelessness action plan.  We are making good progress on the delivery of homes to those most in need across the country, with the new housing plan committed to delivering 72,000 social homes over its lifetime. However, as we increase supply, we also recognise that those experiencing, or at risk of, homelessness have a wide and complex variety of needs. We need to ensure that the appropriate services and policies are in place to support them. Housing is our single biggest issue as a country, with profound social and economic consequences. That is why it is at the centre of the Government’s focus.  Along with the largest ever commitment on social housing, the new national housing plan commits to delivering 300,000 new homes, including 90,000 affordable supports to help people who are struggling to have a home of their own. The plan sets out the highest ever commitment of State funding for housing, with €28 billion over the next five years, coupled with additional funding through State vehicles, including the Land Development Agency, the Housing Finance Agency, Home Building Finance Ireland, the First Home Scheme and the Irish Strategic Investment Fund. Housing delivery, along with infrastructure and utility investment to enable delivery at scale, is at the core of the agreed national development plan published in July, and, at €275 billion, the largest ever capital injection in the history of the State.  To build homes at the scale now required, we need improved and more resilient water, energy and transport services. We will see large-scale investment in all of these areas over the coming years. Last month under price review 6, the investment plan for energy infrastructure was finalised, including funding allocations of up to €18 billion to ESB and EirGrid, leveraged by the Government injection of €3.5 billion in equity to these companies. This will enable thousands more homes to be connected to the grid.  We have also published the investment plan for water, which sets out over €12 billion investment in our water infrastructure, the majority of which will support the delivery of our housing targets. In addition, we are tackling barriers to delivery, through the accelerating infrastructure report and action plan, which includes reforms which will support public and private sector delivery of homes at scale.  Housing is at the centre of the State’s investment and focus for the coming years. However, to meet our targets, we will also need significant delivery from the private sector and we have implemented a number of measures and reforms in support of this. We have focused on making apartment delivery more financially viable, reformed our planning process and created a stable policy environment to enable the private sector to deliver at scale.  We are seeing indications now that our measures are beginning to take effect, evidenced by CSO data showing that we have had an increase of almost 30% in homes approved for planning in quarter 3 of this year, in comparison with the same time period last year, with the number of apartments approved up by over 50%. These are clear indications of confidence. Work is under way to zone a significantly higher quantum of land across the country. Now is the time for ambitious execution, and we have set out a clear framework and roadmap for the coming years to do this. I am confident that we can build on our success to date and bring about a very significant scale-up in our delivery of housing over the lifetime of this Government. \n Deputy Séamus McGrath  I thank the Taoiseach. I welcome today's announcement in relation to the vacant property refurbishment grant and the extension of this grant until 2030. This provides important certainty from a policy point of view in relation to vacant properties. We know they are still a very significant challenge. I also welcome the new initiative in relation to the above the shop grant. Up to €140,000, where multiple properties are involved, is potentially available. That is very significant and the fact that it will be available by quarter 1 of the new year is very important. It is important to look at the local authorities and their resourcing in terms of being able to deal with this grant. I ask the Taoiseach to also look at that. We want these grants to be processed in a timely manner so that we can get on with utilising this currently under-occupied space. The resourcing of local authorities is important and I ask the Taoiseach to look at that. \n Deputy Paul McAuliffe  In my constituency between Shanowen Road and Collins Avenue there are proposals to build new apartment developments. While the additional new housing is incredibly welcome, unfortunately the under-utilised industrial estate there is currently occupied by Santry Boxing Club. Would the Taoiseach agree as well as powering ahead with the provision of new housing, Dublin City Council needs to have a more proactive strategy of making land available to sports clubs so they can avail of programmes like the sports capital grant? Santry Boxing Club is an amazing local facility and will be a great facility for those new homes that will be built. As well as enabling new homes, we need to put in place new facilities, and Dublin City Council needs to be more proactive in making land available to sports clubs. \n Deputy Shane Moynihan  As the Taoiseach said, the delivery of housing is the number one priority for this Government. That is why it is strategically important that all sectors of the Government support that aim, namely through the national development plan's transport sectoral plan, which was published recently. In my constituency, which the Taoiseach visited, we see it as one of the fastest-growing constituencies in the country, with large developments like Adamstown and Clonburris flying ahead. In its county development plans, South Dublin County Council is setting very ambitious targets for zoning. The key to enabling this zoning and to enabling delivery of those homes is the deployment and development of DART+ South West as a transport programme, to intensify the capacity on that line, not only benefitting commuters in Dublin Mid-West but also Kildare North, Dublin South-Central and Dublin-Central.  I am asking the Taoiseach for his support to do all we can to prioritise and bring forward, where possible, the delivery of Dart+ South West as a long overdue infrastructure requirement to not only allow catch-up on public transport in my area but also to plan for the future. \n Deputy John Connolly  One of the actions in the recently published housing plan is that the Department will be publishing quarterly and annual performance tables for new-build output versus targets per local authority, thereby ensuring transparency and accountability.  I understand that will commence next June in relation to social housing. We should also provide similar tables in relation to affordable housing. The local authorities should also be assessed on their output of affordable housing. What actions will the Government take with local authorities that are not meeting their housing targets? \n Deputy Ryan O'Meara  Last February the Government announced its intention to remove the requirement for planning permission for log cabins and modular homes in backyard developments. By the end of the Christmas recess, it will be nearly a year since we heard that announcement. One-off houses in rural Ireland can benefit if we allow log cabins and modular homes to be built not just in backyard developments. They are also one of the few affordable houses out there for young people in rural Ireland whom I speak to. I could give numerous examples of log cabins and modular homes across north Tipperary and north-west Kilkenny that are at threat of enforcement proceedings because they do not have planning permission. Enforcement should not be ongoing until we know what these regulations say. In addition, the development contributions for one-off rural houses should be scrapped again. They are simply a privilege for building on your own land. First, will we see these planning regulations that will exempt log cabins? Second, will this go beyond backyard developments and allow them in rural areas? Third, when will we see the regulations? \n An Ceann Comhairle  I call Deputy Ruth Coppinger. One question. \n Deputy Ruth Coppinger  I also send my solidarity to the Jewish community in Sydney following the appalling attack.  I am sure the Taoiseach agrees with me that cities should be liveable and should have culture as well as venues where people can meet, socialise and enjoy themselves. Will the Cabinet committee on housing and local government discuss the issue of The Complex, a very important cultural space in our capital where artists are currently housed but have been given an eviction notice for the middle of January? A protest on this will come to the Dáil tomorrow. I have attended meetings and other get-togethers in The Complex. In fact, it was the venue for the launch of one of the presidential campaigns. Dublin City Council is open to buying The Complex but only if it can be given 80% to 90% of the funding. We need to intervene to buy this for €10 million. It would be €80 million to buy or to build a similar space. \n Deputy Rose Conway-Walsh  I ask the Taoiseach to consider issuing an upfront fund to local authorities, but to Mayo County Council in particular, in order that they can turn around the vacant properties they have without having to go through the bureaucratic nightmare of applying for funding from central government on a house-by-house, unit-by-unit basis. Can the Taoiseach imagine what it is like to be a homeless person in Mayo watching council houses remain empty month after month while nothing is done? I will give him an example from a young mother in my constituency:  I am homeless, living in a friend's house. I've just had my first baby. She's now a month old. She was born at 36 weeks. I've been in and out of hospital the whole of the pregnancy with stress and anxiety. I developed diabetes also. I was rushed to a Dublin hospital for a week from bleeding and pains. I had a terrible experience. A lot of this stress has been brought on because of my homeless situation.  That is the case for many people. \n Deputy Barry Heneghan  I too join in the condolences on the attack that happened on the Jewish community in Australia.  I also support the plea for funding for The Complex.  Regarding the Cabinet committee on housing, across the country AHBs have signed turnkey deals that then collapse. In Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown, there was a recent scheme that had the contract signed, everything was above board, they were all ready and, at the last minute, when they were looking for funding, the Department denied the funding for 40 turnkey units. If we are to bring medium-sized and small developers into the market, this risk cannot be acceptable. We will not get the funding from the funding schemes, and it is putting all the risk on the developers. The homes are built, the deal collapses and the investor walks away. We want these small-scale developers to meet the housing targets. I have hundreds of people in my constituency looking for affordable housing, and this cannot happen. \n Deputy Darren O'Rourke  I want to raise the issue of child homelessness. In October there were 5,274 children in emergency accommodation. More than 150 of those were in my county, Meath. There is an expectation that at Christmas there will be more than 5,000 and that almost 1,000 of those will be in emergency accommodation for their second or third Christmas. Are there specific measures the Government will take in advance of Christmas, now a handful of days away, to minimise the number of children in homelessness this Christmas? \n Deputy Ruairí Ó Murchú  We all know the issue that exists in relation to housing, whether it is homelessness, the lack of supply, those who cannot get houses, whether from a rental point of view or a purchase point of view, and those languishing on social housing lists. However, we also have to look at the issue of estate management. I do not believe the local authorities, like Louth County Council, have the necessary powers when dealing with chaotic tenants. They may need supports, but even beyond that, we have seen outright criminality and drug-dealing. We know that AHBs have greater levels of power even in relation to the nuclear action of eviction. That should be the last thing that is looked at but, at the end of the day, it is a requirement. I have worked alongside the Louth local authority, the Garda and others in dealing with some situations and we have attempted to move people sideways to deal with the issue. Some very good work has been done, but we do not have the necessary tools, and that is the problem. \n Deputy Liam Quaide  One of the most infuriating parts of the housing crisis is the tens of thousands of properties that have been left idle and decaying throughout the country. Youghal's potential to be on a par with Kinsale for economic prosperity and tourism has been thwarted by the epic scale of dereliction that has been allowed to take place there over many years. Likewise, Castlemartyr and Midleton have many prime-location properties left like deserted husks where boutiques could be flourishing or community hubs or accommodation created. In Holland or Germany this would not be tolerated. Landlords would have to sell up or repurpose a vacant property within a reasonable period or face losing it. The Government's softly-softly approach to vacancy and dereliction is clearly not working, and our towns and villages are haunted by this policy failure. We need to see swift direct action by our local authorities with landlords who blight our streets with decaying properties and a much more urgent pursuit of derelict site levies. The collection of derelict site levies by Revenue is welcome, but why is the Government waiting until 2027 to implement this? \n Deputy Peadar Tóibín  The housing crisis has had varied and wide ramifications in Irish society. One of them is a serious fall in the fertility rate in this State. There has been a 30% fall in the number of births annually. There has been a 20,000 fall in the number of births annually since Celtic tiger times. Some 69% of people aged 25 years or under are living with their parents. Well over 40% of adults who are under 30 are living with their parents. That is changing the very nature of Irish society. The ability for adults to form relationships to have children is being deleted for hundreds of thousands of people. This is having massive ramifications. Schools are now noticing that there is a fall in the number of children being enrolled. An unbalanced demographic structure has serious consequences for our workforce and our pensions. Planning, permitting, licensing, tendering and judicial reviews here are among the slowest in the whole of the European Union. While the Taoiseach's Government has announced plans, they are not ambitious enough and I do not believe they will be implemented in a timely fashion. \n The Taoiseach  There were quite a number of questions there, beginning with Deputy Séamus McGrath. I welcome also the good initiative we have announced today, namely the extension of the vacant refurbishment grant to 2030, but specifically on the commercial properties and the €140,000 plus a €5,000 grant for assistance to support the owner to design a project. The Deputy is right in saying that we need to make sure that the local authorities prioritise this - in other words, that they put a project manager or whatever in charge of this operation in the towns and the cities to make this a reality. It needs to be driven with someone who is accountable and who is doing this every single day, in my view. I will talk to the Minister about that.  We need to alert all the business committees in towns and cities because people need to know. If you combine it with the living city initiative, there are real prospects of, once and for all, getting activity in towns and city centres to address dereliction and allow for change of use. Due to changing patterns of trade and so on, many commercial uses are no longer sustainable, so there is an opportunity for increased numbers residential units in towns and cities.  Deputy McAuliffe raised the topic of the Santry Boxing Club. I was recently with the Land Development Agency, LDA, on the southside, where an existing boxing club has been incorporated into a housing development. A new boxing club is being built in the housing development. That is the way to go. Is the local authority involved in the specific development to which the Deputy referred? It is. The local authority should look seriously at that example. Amenities matter in communities and society. They give young people opportunities. It seems to me that some accommodation must be made for Santry Boxing Club. The other example was a good initiative. The name of the boxing club escapes me now, but the people will have a first-class boxing club as a result of the development. It might be a bigger development. In fairness to the LDA, it saw that needed to be done. The Deputy might give me the details.  Deputy Shane Moynihan spoke about the interdependence of the national transport plan in terms of infrastructure and housing delivery. Housing delivery will depend on infrastructure delivery. I am acutely aware of planning considerations. South Dublin County Council is looking at 10,000 to 18,000 new zonings for housing. That will be dependent on DART+ South West. I have had meetings with the Minister for public expenditure and the Minister for climate and transport, Deputy Darragh O'Brien, to ensure we can underpin the development of DART+ South West. We can make progress on that to give the certainty that the council, Deputy Moynihan and the people in the area require.  Deputy Connolly asked about quarterly tables for social housing. He asked about applying such an approach to affordable housing. I will talk to the Minister. It is a fair point. The councils control a bit more for social housing, but outputs should be across the board. The first issue is to highlight those councils that are not performing. It becomes fairly obvious in a league table scenario which councils are not performing. The actions can take a number of forms. We have to work through the actions. There could be disincentives or limited finance. We have to work through that, but there must be consequences or direct action from the State to override councils that are not performing in respect of housing more generally.  Deputy O'Meara spoke about log cabins and modular homes. I hope that the Minister will in February have a list of exempted developments. I understand it has expanded significantly. There have been a lot of submissions from Government Departments and agencies, particularly those with acute issues, including health, for example, where we need urgent public services. The Minister recently indicated to me that it would be February that we will have completion of that. It is fairly complex and much bigger than we originally anticipated.  The rural housing guidelines need to be published. I have asked the Minister to prioritise that. I fully accept what the Deputy is saying about the potential for enabling and helping young people in rural Ireland to afford housing at a reasonable cost when it comes to buying or renting. We will keep an eye on that. We will look at the development levies over time in respect of rural buildings on people's land although services of one kind or another are required.  I fundamentally agree with Deputy Coppinger that cities should be liveable and that there should be strong social support and creative cultural amenities. The Deputy said the local authority is depending on someone else. Other local authorities tend to get on with it and are in a position to facilitate either the acquisition or purchase of a building without having to do the simple equation and getting the Department to pay out for every single acquisition. The Minister for public expenditure has taken an interest in this issue. I will check the current lie of the land in respect of the Complex. I know Deputy Heneghan also raised that issue.  To Deputy Conway-Walsh, I say that there is no reason why voids should take so long. There has to be some framework of control for the Department. We discovered recently with the tenant in situ scheme that houses were being bought with people living in them. Those houses are bought by councils and suddenly there is €80,000 or €100,000 going into the house. The original objective of that was to stop people going into homelessness. When a local authority house becomes vacant, unless there is something majorly wrong structurally, it should be occupied within a month. We have given huge money to local authorities for voids over the past five years. They should get on with it. They let the houses lie idle for too long. It is inexcusable. In some councils, there is inertia. I have seen it. People leave very good houses for one reason or another, the shutters go up and the houses are left there for three or four months. Those houses should be reoccupied once the electrics and everything else are grand. If we have to get around to repairing them, we can at least give someone the house. That is my view. I get impatient about it from time to time, to be honest. I hear what the Deputy is saying. If you give an upfront grant, there is no guarantee it will be spent on voids, and that is the problem.  I do not have the details of the 40-turnkey units to which Deputy Heneghan referred. Are they in Dún Laoghaire? \n Deputy Barry Heneghan  Yes. \n The Taoiseach  Has the Deputy moved across? \n Deputy Barry Heneghan  I am national now. \n The Taoiseach  The Deputy has a wide compass. He is national now. I ask him to give me the details and I will follow through. It should not happen. I do not know the background to that.  I appreciate the Deputy's comments about the Jewish community in Ireland and the impact that what happened in Bondi Beach has had on the Jewish community globally and in Ireland. The murder that took place was quite shocking. Others were injured. The Deputy also referenced the Complex.  Deputy O'Rourke spoke about child homelessness. The meeting of the Cabinet subcommittee on housing yesterday was entirely about different aspects of homelessness. We had good presentation of data. The data illustrates that there is a wide variety of reason why people become homeless. There are different factors. There is a high rate for singles in homelessness as well as children. There are different elements to the issue. An increasing amount of those who leave direct provision end up homeless. Family reunification comes with that. The link between migration and housing has grown, but is not the only factor. Family separation is a factor. Different factors give rise to homelessness, and specifically child homelessness. The Minister has specific measures. He achieved €100 million in the budget to acquire social housing and housing more generally to take more families out of emergency accommodation and get them into either local authority houses or acquired homes. There is a specific programme ahead now.  Have I dealt with everyone? I have not. \n An Ceann Comhairle  Deputies Ó Murchú and Tóibín. \n The Taoiseach  How could I forget Deputy Ó Murchú? He spoke about estate management powers to deal with what he described as \"chaotic tenants\". There are powers. I am not sure that the AHBs have different powers. They just have a different way of operating. \n Deputy Ruairí Ó Murchú  It is about eviction. \n The Taoiseach  They have a different of operating. They lay it down from the beginning. \n Deputy Ruairí Ó Murchú  It is easier for them to evict people. \n The Taoiseach  Local authorities have struggled with this for quite a long time. My own belief is that persistent misbehaviour and so on should mean you lose the tenancy. That is what should happen. It is hard. We know of housing estates that have awful tensions, difficulties and challenges. I would be glad to work with the Deputy on the issue. I will talk to the Minister about it.  Deputy Quaide spoke about the thousands of houses that have been left lying idle. We give responsibilities to the local authorities. Deputy Connolly talked about league tables. There is a league table showing which local authorities did what in respect of derelict sites. It is very telling. There are two or three that did an exceptional job. If they can do it, why cannot others? It begs the question of whether there is, or has been historically, inertia in local authorities about the Derelict Sites Act. Revenue will now be charged with it. That will bring about a change and better behaviour. The reason for the length of time, and I hope it can be accelerated, is the mapping. I have challenged officials from the Department of Finance and Revenue about this issue. I have asked why the maps are not there already and why they would take so long. Apparently, at the time of the land tax and others, the mapping was not as comprehensive as people would have expected.  That is the issue there. I think it is a game-changer and will be a game-changer.  Deputy Tóibín is making a link between falling fertility and the housing issue. Again, there are a number of variables, I imagine, responsible for that. The bottom line is we do need to provide more housing more quickly to as many young people as possible. It is a social need. Every young person in the country has a right to aspire to owning a home, and many do aspire to owning a home, or some young families being able to rent a home at an affordable cost. We are building substantially more houses than we did five years ago. We are doing about 30,000 odd now compared to 20,000 in 2020. We need to go to 50,000 and we need all hands on deck in that respect. I do not think enrolments are going down in schools yet, I think they are going up. \n Deputy Peadar Tóibín  They are; 30 schools are falling this year. And childcare. ",

        "answerText": " Deputy Rose Conway-Walsh  I wish the Minister well in her new role. It has probably never been so important.  I listened intently to the Minister's answers on the incident involving five drones endeavouring to intercept the plane of President Zelenskyy recently. Was a C70 form was completed to ensure there was a Garda-Defence Forces co-ordinated response? Were all protocols followed in the context of that incident? \n Deputy Helen McEntee  I propose to take Questions No. 103 and 112 together.  Deputy Malcolm Byrne, who submitted Question No. 112, is not here. As I outlined in my earlier response, the widely reported incident regarding drones operating in the vicinity of the Naval Service vessel has been discussed here at length this evening. Notwithstanding some suggestions, President Zelenskyy's flight was not compromised and the security operation led by An Garda Síochána was successfully deployed through multiple means, ultimately leading to a safe and successful visit.  When we are speaking about these issues, we all need to ensure that we are speaking about the facts. I appreciate Deputy Conway-Walsh is asking for facts but in some instances only limited information can be provided given the security nature of what we are discussing. I have been fully briefed, in my capacity as Minister for Defence as part of the national security committee, on the initial findings and I am reassured by both the Defence Forces and An Garda Síochána that they have examined and are examining this matter extensively. While I can confirm a C70 was issued by An Garda Síochána to the Defence Forces seeking assistance in respect of the visit of President Zelenskyy, the Deputy will appreciate I cannot comment further because these are operational matters. However, a C70 form was issued by An Garda Síochána to the Defence Forces.  One of my key priorities as Minister for Defence is to ensure our Defence Forces capabilities are maintained, developed and enhanced so that the organisation can meet all Government-assigned roles, including those that may arise as a result of drone incursions. This is something we are seeing more and more of across Europe and the world. The work of the Defence Forces in this space aligns with broader national security planning that is ongoing. Work is well under way on the military radar programme I mentioned earlier, which is a significant capability enhancement. A dedicated project team of senior civil and military personnel has been advancing this programme, particularly in relation to the counter-drone element and it is being actively pursued by my officials. This morning, I brought to Cabinet the next stages of the new radar system. We have put forward the new preliminary business case. We are partnering with France and I hope early in the new year to be able to bring the final business, so that we can start what will be an extensive roll-out of our new radar capabilities. \n Deputy Rose Conway-Walsh  I certainly welcome the increase in the radar capability. It is very important. I appreciate that the Minister cannot give every detail and has to be cautious in what she says but people want to know. They want reassurance that we are resilient enough and that our reliance is holding up and being improved all the time. One of the questions that has been asked of me a lot is on what protocol is in place when there is drone activity in our airspace. Are airlines notified? What happens when such incidents occur? I very much appreciate and welcome the fact that President Zelenskyy had a safe landing and take-off, and was safe while he was here. That tells us certain things but we need to know whether other incidents could have happened and whether all the protocols were followed in that incident. Will the Minister tell us what the protocol is in relation to drone activity? \n Deputy Helen McEntee  I have confidence in our ability to defend ourselves and those who travel to this country. However, we all appreciate that there is more we need to do. We are no different from any other country in that regard.  There are, of course, standard operating procedures, SOPs, different rules of engagement and different laws depending on whether an incident occurs on sea, air or land. It is for those who are trained and who are operating on the ground to respond and make sure they comply with the different standard operating procedures.  At all times, whether it was the Naval Service or those responding, those involved in this incident operated within the SOPs. However, as there should be with any incident like this, a review is taking place and the Garda is working closely with the Defence Forces on that. If there are operating procedures that need to be enhanced, improved or changed and if better structures need to be put in place, that certainly should be done. I reiterate that there was not a closing of airspace and no significant issue arose.  Of course we need to be very serious about any type of threat and any types of drones in our airspace or within the vicinity of our vessels. This is something we are taking extremely seriously. It is why we are prioritising within the €1.7 billion budget the development of new radar capabilities and the expansion of our sonar, air fleet and ground fleet. \n Deputy Rose Conway-Walsh  I reiterate that we need to have some transparency. That is why I asked that the remit of the defence and national security committee be revisited. Transparency and accountability are very important. I welcome the investment the Minister announced last week, which is badly needed to address the neglect there has been of our Defence Forces, but there must be oversight of how it is spent and accountability for it. People need to know we are resilient as a State. That is necessary not just for the public but also in terms of our competitiveness and the assurances we can give to foreign direct investors in this country. They need to be assured right across the board in terms of our cybersecurity and security generally. Those issues have gone way up the scale in terms of things that are important to multinational businesses and also to our indigenous businesses. \n Deputy Helen McEntee  I commend the men and women of the Defence Forces on the fantastic work they do. In my time as Minister for Defence, my priority will be investing in them and their capabilities, including their ability to respond to emerging threats. It is also important to acknowledge the historic role our troops have played in peacekeeping. That will continue to be a focus and priority.  Regarding the changing environment and changing threats, so much has moved to cyber threats. It is an issue that is raised regularly with all of us by companies small and large and by our agencies as well. It is vitally important that we continually invest in all our abilities to respond to these types of threats. I mentioned in response to an earlier question the investment that is going into technologies within the Defence Forces to enable them to identify and reject these types of threats. There has been huge investment in recent years in An Garda Síochána. Through the Department of enterprise, working with IDA Ireland and Enterprise Ireland, there has also been huge investment to ensure businesses are alert to these types of threats, are able to respond to them and know exactly who to go when these types of incidents occur. We all need to work collectively on this issue. A huge amount of funding will be spent on the Defence Forces and, with that, we will make sure the right structures and resources are in place to protect that investment. ",

It is important to note that National Security rests primarily with the Department of Justice and An Garda Síochána. The Defence Forces’ role, as always, is to provide support to An Garda Síochána where specific capabilities are required under the Aid to the Civil Power (ATCP) framework.  An Garda Síochána is central to the security planning and preparation. It has established a dedicated European Union Presidency co-ordination office to oversee all aspects of operational planning, logistics and inter-agency engagement.  Support during the Presidency may include security-related and logistical assistance from across the Defence Forces — the Army, Naval Service and Air Corps — in response to requirements identified by An Garda Síochána. The Defence Forces and An Garda Síochána maintain a strong working relationship, and engagement has already taken place in respect of preliminary security planning. Further engagement with colleagues in the Department of Justice and AGS will ensure early visibility of any formal requests for Defence Forces assistance. ",

        "answerText": " Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade  Since the establishment of diplomatic relations in 1993, Ireland has developed close economic, political and people-to-people ties with South Africa. This was reflected in South Africa’s decision to invite Ireland to participate this year as a guest country in the G20 during the South African G20 Presidency. This year, in October, we also welcomed the successful official visit to Ireland by President Cyril Ramaphosa.  Ireland and South Africa enjoy strong trade and investment flows in both directions. Our Embassy and the state agencies work very closely together on the ground to promote Irish business interests. This includes local market team collaboration and mutual support to ensure successful trade and investment missions to South Africa.  In countries where state agencies have an office, and are situated in the same city as an Embassy or Consulate, our preference is to consolidate the Ireland House model, whereby missions and state agencies are co-located. Accommodating the representatives of the state under one roof improves services to citizens and business and offers opportunities for enhanced value for money.  Given business needs in South Africa, the Enterprise Ireland office is located in Cape Town and the IDA and Bord Bia share a representative who is based in Johannesburg. Embassies are always located in the capital of the country to which they are accredited, so physical co-location with state agencies is not always possible, as in the case of South Africa, where the Embassy is in Pretoria. However, I am pleased that the strong Team Ireland coordination and supports in place ensure that our economic interests are protected and advanced. ",

      "question": {
        "answerText": " The Taoiseach  I propose to take Questions Nos. 1 to 11, inclusive, together.  The Government is committed to the delivery of a national security strategy and work is ongoing in finalising the strategy, co-ordinated by the national security secretariat in my Department and integrating inputs from a range of relevant stakeholders, including the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, the Department of Defence, the Department of Justice, Home Affairs and Migration, An Garda Síochána, the Defence Forces and the National Cybersecurity Centre.  The programme for Government, securing Ireland's future sets out a number of national security commitments, acknowledging that this is a time of upheaval, in particular geopolitical upheaval, with threats and challenges arising from a rapidly changing global geopolitical landscape. The preparation of a draft strategy covers a broad range of national security issues. There is necessarily a focus on the State’s internal security, including the evolving challenges we face from terrorism and extremism and from cyber threats, and a focus on the need to increase our investment in security and to modernise our legislation in the security field, notably in the investigatory powers available to our services. It will include also the implications of recent security, defence and international developments and their related impacts, notably the deteriorating security situation in Europe given Russia's ongoing war in Ukraine and the growth in cyber and hybrid threats in Europe. It will combine an enhanced maritime domain awareness with a prioritised focus on ensuring protection of critical maritime infrastructure, especially critical undersea infrastructure. The ongoing implementation of the report of the Commission on the Defence Forces and the modernisation of aspects of our defence legislation is also included in the preparations.  The National Cyber Security Centre has been placed under the remit of the Minister for Justice, Home Affairs and Migration. This is an important element of the realignment of our national security infrastructure, and a project has been initiated to establish this new statutory national security authority, led by the Department of Justice, Home Affairs and Migration. Earlier this year, I established the Ministerial Council on National Security, which comprises me as chair, the Tánaiste, the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade and for Defence, and the Minister for Justice, Home Affairs and Migration. The council will ensure that at the highest level there is a structured, ongoing review of our strategic national security interests and systematised monitoring of progress on delivering the Government’s commitments over the coming months, including the finalisation of the draft national security strategy. \n Deputy Tom Brabazon  As the Taoiseach is aware, drone sightings in Dublin Bay during the recent Zelenskyy visit underline and underscore the scale of our vulnerabilities and the urgency and need for preparing a strategic national security package. There are reports that international anti-drone units were deployed to Dublin during the visit to assist the emergency response unit. While we welcome the assistance of other states, we should not have to rely on others for our own defence. We should be self-reliant in the first instance. It should be expected that such activity will continue when Ireland takes over the EU Presidency next year, and a national security strategy would allow us to assess risks facing the State, including emergency aerial and technological threats, and set clear goals to guide Government and law makers. Can the Taoiseach provide an update to the House on the development of Ireland's national security strategy and an update on the drone sightings during the Zelenskyy visit? \n Deputy Albert Dolan  When we are talking about national security, it is vital we also give people confidence at a local level in our local security, particularly with regard to An Garda Síochána. In Galway East we have towns that are booming, thriving and growing such as Gort, Loughrea, Tuam and Athenry. Those towns are all feeding into Galway city. They have seen massive population increases and for those people to feel secure in those towns, we need an increase in our gardaí allocation and our gardaí numbers. More importantly, as the populations continue to grow in these towns, we need gardaí that become community gardaí, that the people know and connect with and can build relationships with into the future. These gardaí will serve the area. Our gardaí on the ground right now are working really hard but they need to be supported to handle the large caseloads right across the country but particularly in Galway East, we need additional gardaí. \n Deputy Paul Murphy  Does the Taoiseach think there is any national security implications for the significant decline in basic civil liberties that is happening in Britain, such as the proscription of organisations of Palestine protestors like Palestine Action, the denial of the right to a jury in the vast majority of trials and what is happening with the Palestine protesters who are charged with nothing more than property damage and who have been held for over a year without trial and without access to bail? The consequence is there are now eight protesters on hunger strike for over 30 days. This is the longest, most significant hunger strike since the H-block hunger strikers. Their demands are minimal, namely, the right to a fair trial, the right to access bail, the right to access medical care in prison and for the ending of the proscription of Palestine Action. There is an almost total media blackout on this in Britain, leading people to suspect there is a so-called D-notice in relation to this. Is the Taoiseach concerned about the decline of civil liberties and the fact that people are forced to go on hunger strike in Britain? \n Deputy Ryan O'Meara  Next year we will hold the Presidency of Europe. During that time, as the Taoiseach is more than aware, our national security will be of paramount importance. Given what has happened with drone activity and interference in Denmark, there is a fear the same will happen in Ireland. With President Zelenskyy's visit last week, we saw drones off the coast of Dublin. It is one thing for us to be a militarily neutral country, and that is right, but it is another thing for us to be able to say whether we can patrol our own skies and protect our own airspace. In light of the Presidency coming up in the middle part of next year, what will our national security strategy do? When will we see it? What will be in it regarding the protection of our skies and airports from rogue actors operating drones? \n Deputy Rose Conway-Walsh  The very serious incident of five drones endeavouring to intercept the plane carrying President Zelenskyy last week brought our unpreparedness on defence and national security into sharp focus. Was the C70 form completed to ensure that a Garda defence co-ordinated response was put in place? Were all protocols followed? Why did the navy ship not have drone-disabling equipment? Why were airlines not informed that there was drone activity in the vicinity into which they were flying?  Lieutenant General Rossa Mulcahy told John Mooney of The Sunday Times that the military needs more personnel, intelligence and high-tech capabilities to navigate these uncertain times. Why is the Taoiseach so reluctant to allow the defence and national security committee to do what its title suggests and have oversight of national security? \n Deputy Peadar Tóibín  Can the Taoiseach categorically say that the Government is able to protect all of the EU leaders who will come to this country during the EU Presidency? Who launched the drones that were seen off Dublin Bay during the Zelenskyy visit? Why were those drones not dealt with? Where did these drones come from? Where did they retreat to? How come none of that information is known at this stage? Who was behind the drones? We have heard statements that it is likely that they may have come from Russia, but what evidence is there of this? One of the more memorable answers the Taoiseach gave to a question on national security in the previous Dáil, when the issue of the so-called Russian spy was discussed, was that he did not receive those briefings. He quite pointedly said he did not receive the information he should be receiving on that. How can people in Ireland have confidence, given the fact that our Defence Forces have been run down for so long and we can only staff one ship on the seas at any given time? \n Deputy Paul Lawless  The national security strategy consultation launched in 2019 was intended to guide our strategy on security for the past five years, from 2020-25. Despite this, no strategy was published during this timeframe. During that timeframe we had a huge ransomware attack on the HSE which put a significant number of people's lives and health in jeopardy and cost the State several million euro. What is happening on this? When will the strategy be published? It is costing the State a significant amount of money. \n Deputy Ruairí Ó Murchú  We need some sort of detail and we need to know there is a plan to address cybersecurity and hybrid warfare. The HSE attack brought to light what was probably happening to a lot of businesses which did not provide information. There has been increased funding for the National Cyber Security Centre, NCSC, but we need to get down to brass tacks. There have been drone attacks over the past while and we need to make sure that we have the capacity and technological know-how to be able to deal with these issues. There has been a failure to date in respect of funding to ensure we have the full capacity required. \n Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett  One of the biggest atrocities and national security breaches was the Dublin-Monaghan bombing carried out by the Glenanne gang. There were headlines yesterday stating that there was no collusion in the Dublin-Monaghan bombing. First, the Kenova report yesterday dealt with Stakeknife, not the Dublin-Monaghan bombing. The Denton report will not be published until January. \n The Taoiseach  It was a summary of Denton. \n Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett  The report states that the British Army had the names of the killers on the night of the bombing but nobody was ever arrested. The representatives of the families think that smacks of collusive behaviour. The authors were also extremely critical of the Irish authorities, including the Garda, and the British authorities for destroying much of the files and evidence so that the people compiling the report could not gather conclusive evidence. The whole thing stinks to high heaven. The representatives of the families have asked for a public inquiry. Will the Taoiseach listen to them? \n The Taoiseach  I thank all Deputies who raised issues in terms of national security and the national security strategy. It reflects a growing awareness and engagement with this House, not before time, in respect of security and defence issues. There has been a wilful ignoring of these issues for far too long in the House. Particular perspectives have been taken on this. Even this morning, there were references to the United Kingdom, Europe or America as being threats. The clear threats right now in this era include a Russian threat to our security and security infrastructure. We have had engagement between Iran and Russia and North Korea and Russia. North Korean soldiers have been on European soil during a period of war, seeking to violate the territorial integrity of Ukraine and its sovereignty. These are the realities we face. We wish we were not facing these realities and we would prefer a Continent at peace and so on.  The strategy will be completed. Deputy Brabazon was the first to speak and referred to self-reliance. We will develop radar capacity, and that is very close to action in terms of procurement – a lot of work has gone into that. We need to co-operate and co-ordinate with other member states in the European Union and the United Kingdom in respect of all of these issues because a pattern has developed in terms of the emergence of these drones and the violation of the airspace of EU member states. The most notable incident occurred in Copenhagen at the time of the European Political Community meeting. Denmark sought help and advice from other EU member states at that time. There were incidents in Belgium, France, Poland, in terms of train tracks and so on, and in the Baltic Sea. We are agreed that, on the drone issue, disabling technology is important.  The visit of President Zelenskyy was very effective from a security perspective. I want to make it clear to everybody that an incident did occur on that night. A small number of unidentified drones were observed in the vicinity of a Naval Service vessel on patrol off the coast of Dublin. The drones were not a threat to President Zelenskyy's aircraft - that needs to be clear - because it had safely landed quite some time prior to the incident, nor were they a threat to his departure. An operational response was put in place that was appropriate to the circumstances by the commander of the naval vessel at the time and, subsequently, by the police and military authorities working in close co-operation. They worked closely together in advance of the visit and so on.  The Garda liaised with its Ukrainian partners throughout the visit of the President on the security arrangements, including with regard to this incident. The Garda special detective unit is carrying out an investigation of the circumstances of the incident with input from the Defence Forces. It is a very concerning incident, as I said, like other similar incidents in other European states. The circumstances are suggestive of this being part of an ongoing Russian-inspired hybrid campaign against European Union and Ukrainian interests. \n Deputy Paul Murphy  I would like the Taoiseach to present some evidence. He said the circumstances are suggestive----- \n The Taoiseach  Of course the Deputy would. Could I say to Deputy Brabazon----- \n Deputy Paul Murphy  The circumstances are contested. It might well have been the Russians but I would like to see some evidence if this will be used as an agenda to undermine our neutrality. \n An Ceann Comhairle  We just cannot have this, Deputy Murphy. \n The Taoiseach  The gardaí----- \n An Ceann Comhairle  We cannot have this interaction. \n The Taoiseach  I will come back to the Deputy. \n Deputy Paul Murphy  I thank the Taoiseach. \n The Taoiseach  An Garda Síochána is substantively enhancing and has enhanced its anti-drone capabilities. It has significant capabilities on land, and the navy likewise. The military generally has the capabilities throughout all three strands: air, sea and land. We will continue to enhance that and harness all technology available in the country, both private sector but also on our university campuses that can assist in that regard.  All politics is local and Deputy Dolan asked about gardaí in east Galway and the expanding towns. We have seen good progress in the recruitment of gardaí through Templemore. It has seen its highest intake this year. The Commissioner has been allocating significant numbers to given areas. Dublin benefited initially. Cork is benefiting now, to be quite frank, in terms of the city centre. The idea is to get around to the rest of the country but to do it in significant numbers so it really has impact. I understand we are pleading for patience on the Deputy's behalf and others but we are making progress. Funding is there to keep the throughput at the level it currently is in Templemore.  On the remarks made by Deputy Murphy, the United Kingdom does not present a national security threat to Ireland. \n Deputy Paul Murphy  The Taoiseach should have read the Denton report. \n The Taoiseach  On the issue he raised in terms of the civil liberties issue within the UK, it is an issue the UK has to challenge and deal with. I noted his comment, \"nothing more than property damage\". That was interesting. I do not believe people should be----- \n Deputy Paul Murphy  Interned for property damage. \n The Taoiseach  No one should be interned and there should be trials. I love the Deputy's casual approach to property damage. It is fine. It is grand. Do not worry about it. Let us continue doing it. \n Deputy Paul Murphy  That is not what I said. \n The Taoiseach  It is what he implied. \n Deputy Paul Murphy  No, it is not. \n The Taoiseach  Ah, come on. \n Deputy Paul Murphy  The point I was making is it is not normal to hold people----- \n The Taoiseach  We discussed this----- \n An Ceann Comhairle  Deputy Murphy made his point already. \n Deputy Paul Murphy  -----without trial for over a year for property damage. \n An Ceann Comhairle  We are not doing this, Deputy Murphy. We are not doing this. \n Deputy Paul Murphy  That is the point I was making and the Taoiseach knows it. \n An Ceann Comhairle  There are other Members to be regarded. \n The Taoiseach  Can I just say to Deputy Murphy that Deputies in this House have had their property damaged. I do not believe that should lead to internment or anything like that. \n Deputy Paul Murphy  Exactly. \n The Taoiseach  No, no. \n An Ceann Comhairle  Allow the Taoiseach to answer. \n The Taoiseach  Let us be very clear. In dealing with protest, there are different levels of protest. The right to protest and to free speech is absolutely inviolable. It has to be allowed and facilitated in any true democracy. When protests get too extreme, you then impact on other people's rights to personal safety, life and property. I respectfully suggest that is something the Deputy does not pay much attention to. \n Deputy Paul Murphy  Israeli weaponry property? No. \n The Taoiseach  In terms of the other issue Deputy O'Meara raised, I have dealt with some of the aspects of what happened on the night and so forth. In terms of the EU Presidency, which people have raised, there is a lot of work under way to prepare for that. An Garda Síochána is central to the security planning and preparation. It has established a dedicated European Union Presidency co-ordination office, led by the deputy commissioner of policing operations to oversee all aspects of operational planning, logistics and inter-agency engagement. There is ongoing interdepartmental engagement through a whole range of forums. Close co-operation with European policing and security partners concerning the Presidency is ongoing, as per the norm.  In the modern security arena, you have to co-ordinate, co-operate and share intelligence with other agencies. That is absolutely key. Otherwise, you are at nothing in terms of protecting the State or protecting our people. I do not want to go into all of the details here. Some of this is security sensitive. I have a report about the drone situation. When we are discussing security, there has to be an understanding there are limits to what can be put into the public domain. That impacts further gathering and garnering of intelligence. It also impacts on our capacity to withstand further threats and so on like that. There will be a lot of planning for VIP protection, venue security, transport management, cyber resilience and public order contingencies. All of that is being worked on. It is a mammoth task. It is a huge operation. Other member states have had to do something similar. It is symptomatic of where we are in terms of the threats to European security and so forth.  I think I have dealt with most of the issues Deputy Rose Conway-Walsh raised and I was responding to her in respect of that. \n Deputy Rose Conway-Walsh  Sorry, the Taoiseach has not----- \n An Ceann Comhairle  Absolutely not, Deputy. The Deputy has to take the answer. \n Deputy Rose Conway-Walsh  I just want to put it on the record the Taoiseach has not answered. \n The Taoiseach  I am not finished yet. No member state yet, bar France in the past 48 hours or so, has attempted to disabled drones or bring them down, for different reasons. That is a matter we have to leave to the operational people in charge. We cannot dictate that sort of a response here. \n Deputy Rose Conway-Walsh  Do we have the capacity? \n An Ceann Comhairle  Deputy, no. \n The Taoiseach  We have the capacity. \n An Ceann Comhairle  If the Deputy needs to raise a Topical Issue, she can put one down. This is not a back and forth. \n The Taoiseach  Once again, it is a matter for those on the ground and in the theatre to decide the best and most appropriate response at the time.  I have dealt with some of Deputy Tóibín's questions. The national security council has been established. There is a clear structure emanating from that in terms of awareness, being briefed and so forth. I was briefed on this incident. I sought a briefing immediately on it and I received it. Obviously, it is something that will be discussed at the national security council later.  In terms of Deputy Lawless----- \n Deputy Peadar Tóibín  The Taoiseach has not categorically----- \n An Ceann Comhairle  No. If the Deputy is not happy with the answer, put down----- \n Deputy Peadar Tóibín  -----stated that EU leaders will be safe during the Presidency. \n An Ceann Comhairle  Deputy Tóibín, you know you are wrong. \n Deputy Peadar Tóibín  He also has not stated where those drones came from and where they went. \n An Ceann Comhairle  I am asking the Deputy to stop addressing the Taoiseach until he finishes his answers, \n Deputy Peadar Tóibín  He has not answered those questions. \n An Ceann Comhairle  The Deputy might not like the answer but it is the Taoiseach's answer. Do not interject again, please. \n The Taoiseach  I was just about to make the point in terms of the cybersecurity attacks. Sorry, we will protect those who are coming into this country. There is no question. Do not always be so fast to denigrate ourselves. Do not listen to all the noise out there. What happened during President Zelenskyy's visit was a good security operation by our Defence Forces and by an Garda----- \n Deputy Peadar Tóibín  Why will the Taoiseach not answer the question about the drones? \n An Ceann Comhairle  Deputy, please have respect for the other Members. \n The Taoiseach  Through the Chair, we need to acknowledge that and the very effective work of An Garda Síochána and our Defence Forces. There is a lot of noise which suits other interests to portray Ireland in a certain light. The Deputy should be wary of that, too.  Deputy Lawless raised the issue of cybersecurity. Cyber threats and attacks have increased significantly since the Russian invasion of Ukraine. Some have been by criminal elements, some have been by professionals. There are also third party state actors in respect of cybersecurity threats. It is a very serious issue for both public utilities and private sector companies. It is costing a lot of funding to deal with that. We have brought the National Cyber Security Centre under the Department of justice. It is a very strong centre and has grown in capacity very significantly in the past five years. I remember when we started it. It has developed a really strong capacity under Richard Browne. Credit needs to be given in respect of that.  I make the point to Deputy Ó Murchú that there is not a failure in funding, frankly, and finance will not be an issue here. What is an issue is the procurement timelines, both within the European defence industry and more generally. We are working to see if we can accelerate procurement. We are doing that with the radar. That is why we took a joint country approach to procurement - to fast track it. In other words, we use the experience and expertise of countries that have experience of procuring the radar we are now seeking. Everyone will be about how fast we can procure. It will also be about taking an intelligent approach in terms of what we procure. The nature of modern warfare or security threats has changed radically. We are all witnessing the drone technology change, as well as the cybersecurity. What can we do undersea? How do we protect cables? How do we protect gas connectors? It is a whole-of-society security approach that is required here. It is not the traditional, conventional approach to defence and security. We need to consider and explore that point more, perhaps.  On the Dublin-Monaghan bombing, Deputy Boyd-Barrett is correct insofar as the summary of the Denton report was produced yesterday. It is regrettable that we do not have the full Denton report. I think there was some legal action taken to try to prevent it being published in full. The Kenova report has been published. We should have a debate on the Kenova report in this House in the new year. It reveals very sordid activity by state actors but also by paramilitaries, including the Provisional IRA. The Kenova report does not pull its punches in saying it was a threat to its own community or attacked its own community. What went on is quite unbelievable.  The Denton report stated that 120 people were murdered by a network of loyalist paramilitaries and RUC and UDR personnel, including those killed in the Dublin-Monaghan bombings. It is a very sordid story and both the Kenova and Denton reports cover it. I pay tribute to Jon Boutcher, who is now the head of the PSNI, for his leadership on Kenova, and also to Iain Livingstone. They withstood a lot of pressure. We will have two comprehensive reports, if we can get the latter one published. \n An Ceann Comhairle  That is it, Taoiseach. We move to questions Nos. 12 to 28, inclusive. With 16 Members and a remaining 18 and a half minutes, it is highly unlikely we will get to the third group of questions. I ask Members to be brief. ",

        "answerText": " The Taoiseach  I propose to take Questions Nos. 12 to 28, inclusive, together.  The Cabinet committee on infrastructure last met on 3 November and will meet again early in the new year. The Cabinet committee works to drive infrastructure delivery and the implementation of the revised national development plan. As Members know, last week, we brought to Government the essence of that plan. The reform of the delivery of critical, growth-enhancing infrastructure is a key commitment in the programme for Government. Last week marked a major milestone on this agenda with the publication of the accelerating infrastructure report and action plan.  This plan sets out 30 high-impact and time-bound reforms to speed and scale up delivery of homes, roads, public transport, wastewater plants and energy infrastructure. Actions include legislative reforms to balance individual rights and public good, simplify regulation and consenting systems, cut administrative burden and red tape and build public acceptance and a delivery culture. The reforms align with broader housing, climate and competitiveness goals. These will be achieved by streamlining approvals to allow concurrent processing, introducing statutory timelines for major project decisions, rationalising delivery guidance to reduce duplication and complexity, enhancing procurement practices through clearer project pipelines, and fostering a delivery-focused culture that balances safeguards with urgency.  We are at a critical juncture. We have a strong economy and growing population, but our infrastructure delivery is too slow. We have a once-in-a-generation opportunity to transform this. The Government, private sector and communities must align behind delivery. The plan is underscored by the largest capital investment in the history of the State, with over €275 billion planned over the coming ten years.  Over recent weeks, Departments have published their ambitious sectoral investment plans for the next five years. Areas such as energy, transport and water will see a significant scale-up in funding and delivery, all of which will support us to address our infrastructure deficit and scale up housing. There will also be robust oversight of the Government’s performance in achieving these actions with regular reports on progress to the Cabinet committee on infrastructure. In the period ahead, the Cabinet committee will, therefore, oversee both the investments and reforms required to ensure that infrastructure is delivered as efficiently and quickly as possible. \n An Ceann Comhairle  There are 12 Deputies present. They will have 30 seconds each, which means there will be six minutes for questions and six minutes for a response. That is as fair as I can be. \n Deputy Aindrias Moynihan  The recently published national development plan update sets out an ambitious plan for key infrastructure for the years ahead. Many of the capital works are due to get under way by 2030 and others thereafter. Having a pipeline of projects ready is vital because there is so much background work involved with them. I am particularly focused on the ones after 2030. We have seen how the N22 Macroom bypass took many years to advance through the earlier stages, such as the background works, planning and design and so on. The next phase of that road is the piece between Macroom and Ballincollig. It needs to continue in the background and get through the various background stages so that we have a pipeline of projects ready to roll as soon as possible. \n Deputy Ruairí Ó Murchú  We have all seen a huge amount of flood damage and the danger of nature. While a huge amount of work has been done by local authorities and emergency services, this brings to light the need to deal expeditiously with CFRAM protections that are necessary throughout Louth. With regard to the south part of the Dundalk and Blackrock project, the promise is quarter 2 of 2027 for planning application submission. There have been promises and we have been waiting years. \n The Taoiseach  Is that CFRAM? \n Deputy Ruairí Ó Murchú  It is CFRAM. There are five particular projects throughout Louth, in Drogheda, Carlingford, Greenore, Baltray and Ardee. The lack of wastewater capacity is also causing issues. \n Deputy Albert Dolan  We need to double-track the rail line from Galway city to Athenry. The passing loop at Oranmore is under construction now. Ceannt Station is moving to be a station with five platforms. Huge investment has gone in but we must continue it because we are going to wait years for the Galway city outer bypass and the reality is that rail is the lever we can pull. We can build a double track from Athenry to Galway city which would greatly improve the quality of life for all commuters in east Galway. \n Deputy Darren O'Rourke  We need updated wind and solar farm guidelines. The wind farm guidelines are in draft form since 2019 and the last full version was in 2006. There is a commitment in the programme for Government for solar farm guidelines but recent responses say they are at a very early stage of a scoping process. When will they be ready? \n Deputy Paul Murphy  The new roll-out of BusConnects routes has been a disaster in my constituency. Constituents report that buses on the F spine route, which were supposed to provide a more direct route to the city centre and greater connectivity, are taking 20 to 30 minutes longer to get into town and providing fewer options for people trying to get to work or school. It is made worse by the frequent delays and cancellations seen across nearly all routes in Dublin South-West, including the S and W spines operated by Go-Ahead Ireland. Elsewhere, the NTA has been forced to change routes in Finglas and Chapelizod due to protests and people making their voices heard. Will the NTA do the same here or will people be forced to protest? \n Deputy Séamus McGrath  Central to a good infrastructure system is a good public transport system. I welcome the approval of BusConnects Cork by Cabinet to proceed to the planning phase. That is very welcome but we cannot wait years for improvements to the local bus service. I am sure the Taoiseach, like other public representatives in Cork, is inundated with unreliability issues relating to local bus services, such as buses not turning up, disappearing buses and inaccurate information on the travel app. It is simply not good enough and it has been going on for years. People are tired of excuses from the National Transport Authority and Bus Éireann. I ask the Taoiseach to please take this issue up and look for immediate improvements. \n Deputy Tony McCormack  While we prioritise electricity, water and transport, digital connectivity must now be treated equally. It is essential for Ireland's competitiveness. Europe has fallen behind the US and China. 5G stand-alone is under 2% in the EU and 0% in Ireland, compared with 20% in the US and 80% in China. AI, ehealth and advanced manufacturing cannot run on yesterday’s networks. If we want future investment in next-generation technology, connectivity must be prioritised. Will the Cabinet committee on infrastructure evaluate 5G stand-alone as a national priority? During Ireland's EU Presidency, will the Government push for strong, pro-investment digital policy under the digital networks Act? \n Deputy Peadar Tóibín  The Navan to Dublin rail line is not included in the national development plan review as a project that will start to be built before 2030. It has no start date for construction at all at the moment. It is up to a future government to fund the construction of a Navan to Dublin rail line. No money has been assigned or ring-fenced for that particular project, despite the fact there are 90,000 people commuting from Meath at the moment, 60,000 of whom travel by car and add to the M50 crisis. The M50 is currently grinding to a halt. If the Government wants to help fix the M50 crisis, allow people in Meath to use public transport to get to work without pushing them into cars every single day. \n Deputy Paul Lawless  Ireland faces an emergency crisis in terms of infrastructure, housing, energy and water. According to the ESRI, an additional 40,000 construction workers will be needed for the housing plan and an additional 40,000 will be needed for infrastructure. That is 80,000 construction workers who are required to meet the Government’s plan. Indeed, the Dublin metro will require 8,000 construction workers. What is the Taoiseach’s plan in order to achieve this? I speak to construction workers in Australia all the time. They want to come home but they are simply totally disenfranchised and disengaged. The Government has no interest in bringing them home. \n Deputy Rose Conway-Walsh  I know the Taoiseach will agree that the people in Mayo deserve to have proper road infrastructure. I want to specifically talk to him about the R312, which is the main road connecting Erris to the county town of Castlebar. I want it to be designated a regional strategic road because that is the only way it will get the funding it needs. It is a dangerous road. People have put up with it for years but it is time for it to be fixed. \n The Taoiseach  Which one is that? \n Deputy Rose Conway-Walsh  It is the R312. I thank the Taoiseach. \n Deputy Barry Heneghan  Ba mhaith liom ceist a chur ar an Taoiseach faoin flooding we saw in Clontarf yesterday. I thank the Minister of State, Deputy Boxer Moran, for coming down and sorting out the dreaded sandbags, but households and businesses were very worried yesterday. I had tens of people----- \n The Taoiseach  Where was that? \n Deputy Barry Heneghan  Clontarf. Does the Taoiseach not know I am a Clontarf man? The flood defence is critically needed. Will flood defences be included in critical infrastructure with the recent announcement last week? This needs to be fast-tracked and people and businesses need assurance. \n An Ceann Comhairle  Finally, Deputy Conor D. McGuinness. \n Deputy Conor D. McGuinness  Once again, I am raising with the Taoiseach the N25, which is the transport spine of Waterford's infrastructure and long regarded as the most dangerous national road in the State. There has been no funding for safety improvements. Routine maintenance, resurfacing and line painting are not good enough at this stage. Bus stops are being withdrawn. There was another HGV incident this morning just outside Dungarvan. We need to see serious investment in safety improvements on the N25 right from Rosslare to Cork city, but particularly in Waterford where there has been no funding for safety improvements. \n An Ceann Comhairle  Taoiseach, the floor is yours for five minutes. \n The Taoiseach  I love the demarcation lines. The \"Rosslare to Cork city, but particularly in Waterford\" part of it. I am sorry. I get it. Do not worry. \n Deputy Conor D. McGuinness  There have been no safety upgrades. There was a serious incident there this morning. \n The Taoiseach  It is just an observation. I will start with Deputy Aindrias Moynihan, who made a very good point. Hopefully, with this national development plan and the allocation of ten years, we will avoid this stop-start where we get a project from A to B but C is not provided for at all. We had that over the last two decades, I suppose. I recall how the Cork-Limerick road had planning in an earlier era and then that was all shelved after the financial crash and so on. If they had kept the planning going, they would have been in a much better position now to actually start. I do accept that, and particularly on the N22. The Macroom bypass has been extremely effective but there is the problem that you go along a great road into Ballincollig if you are coming from the Kerry side but then you are suddenly into what, as the Deputy was saying to me the other day, is like a parking lot for the next 20 to 40 minutes. It is a very good point that we should encourage Transport Infrastructure Ireland, TII, and others to keep thinking of the next stage and to have the planning ready and preparatory work done. I will work on that particular stretch the Deputy has referenced.  Deputy Ó Murchú raised the flood damage, CFRAM and the five projects in Louth. Deputy Barry Heneghan had a similar point. In general, flood protection schemes take a long time. Some of that is due to stakeholder engagement and public engagement, and there can be objections and so on. If any projects are of such imperative, these are. We do know that when these projects happen, they are effective in protecting against flooding. Towns that had historical flooding events have stopped them because of good infrastructure being put in. These projects invite a lot of objections. We had it in Cork city and it went the whole way to the top courts. It is only now that work is under way and all of that. There was flooding in Cork city this week. It was there because of the tidal levels, but one could argue that if you had the protections in, then businesses and people would have been protected and people could have gone in and out of town. I am very conscious of that.  With regard to Deputy Dolan's question, I will come back to the Minister. It was a good point. I do no know where we are on it in terms of the national development plan but there is no question that Galway city is facing enormous congestion, including all the areas feeding into Galway city. It is a real problem. Public transport, including rail, does give us an option, but not the whole option. We have to get the ring road done. Equally, though, the rail infrastructure is critical. I will talk to the Minister for Transport, Darragh O'Brien, about that.  Deputy O'Rourke raised the issue of the updated wind farm guidelines. The Deputy is correct that they have been a long time coming and technology has changed in the intervening period. I have asked the Minister, James Browne, to accelerate the work on the guidelines. The unit in his Department is also working on planning exemptions. There is a lot of work there. The Department is also working on rural guidelines for housing and one-off housing. There is a lot of work in that Department but I accept that we do need to bring this to a conclusion. At some stage, we need some collective debate on energy. We are all dealing with individual cases of objections to solar, objections to gas generation, objections to wind onshore, and objections to wind offshore potentially. We desperately need the offshore wind. This is something we have got to progress through planning. I am hoping we can get wind farms built, certainly through 2030 to 2031. If we do not, then we are in trouble from an energy perspective. As a collective - when I say \"collective\", I mean the entire Oireachtas - we have to try to stand back and say that there are huge challenges. We discussed security earlier. We are very dependent on the importation of fossil fuels through the interconnectors. There are real issues here that we need to be clear-eyed about. We can then take decisions once everybody realises that there are pluses and minuses in all of this.  Deputy Paul Murphy raised BusConnects, which he said was a \"disaster\"----- \n Deputy Paul Murphy  Some of it. \n The Taoiseach  That is okay. It is a word that is not uncommon. Anyway, I have had my issues with BusConnects down through the years. There have been issues for habitual users of bus services who feel the changing of services or the reorientation of scheduling and so on has eroded what they would have had prior to it. Then we had all the issues around what were, in my view, over-the-top initial plans, which then got rolled back. This seems to have been a pattern throughout the BusConnects journey and I think lessons could be learned from that. A lot of heat built up that perhaps was not necessary in the first place because a lot of stuff that was proposed was then taken away. We will engage with the National Transport Authority, NTA, in terms of what is happening. It has made a lot of progress now on BusConnects. We need a good bus transport system.  That brings me to Deputy Séamus McGrath's point. Yes, I have heard similar reports in terms of reliability. Originally, a year and a half ago, the shortage of drivers was blamed, but we definitely need to improve reliability. There had been very good stuff happening in public transport growth and so on.  I will talk to Deputy McCormack again. The Deputy is absolutely correct that America, China and others are way ahead of us in some of this in the digital space. We need to catch up fairly quickly. I will look at the 5G stand-alone issue.  Deputy Tóibín mentioned the NDP. The Navan rail line is in the NDP review----- \n Deputy Peadar Tóibín  It is not a Bill. \n The Taoiseach  The Deputy has a great capacity. He is brilliant at it, actually. From a political agitation perspective, the Deputy has a great capacity to turn what others would see as success into defeat. For the Deputy in opposition to say that we are not releasing----- \n Deputy Peadar Tóibín  That----- \n An Ceann Comhairle  Do not interrupt. \n Deputy Peadar Tóibín  I have to, a Cheann Comhairle. \n An Ceann Comhairle  No, Deputy Tóibín, do not even dare. \n The Taoiseach  The Deputy is trying to ask how I can----- \n An Ceann Comhairle  Deputy Tóibín will have to look for it afterwards. \n The Taoiseach  I spoke to the Minister, Deputy O'Brien, about this and he is very clear that the Navan line is going ahead. \n Deputy Peadar Tóibín  There is no date for construction. \n An Ceann Comhairle  Do not even think about it. \n The Taoiseach  The Government is absolutely committed to it.  On Deputy Lawless's question, there is a huge increase in apprenticeships. We are recruiting people back. We are anxious for people to come back into the country, and people are coming back into the country. The construction industry is confident enough in terms of the numbers for getting the housing done, for example, and the huge retrofit programme that is going on as well.  I will talk and engage with the Minister in respect of Deputy Conway-Walsh's query on the R312.  Regarding Deputy Heneghan's question, I have discussed that in terms of Clontarf and flood relief generally. It will be part of critical infrastructure, absolutely. I see it as critical infrastructure because it is a big threat to us. The storms are worse and they are more severe. We need to accelerate the protection of people, households and businesses in that respect.  On the N25, we need to get the bypasses along that road. That is a section of the road that definitely needs improvement.  I thank the Ceann Comhairle. \n An Ceann Comhairle  I thank the Taoiseach and Members. For future reference, if there needs to be back and forth, this is not the forum in which to pose a question. \n Deputy Ruairí Ó Murchú  In the review----- \n An Ceann Comhairle  We have a Dáil reform committee today at which it will be discussed. \n The Taoiseach  We need a bit of entertainment and lively engagement, too. \n An Ceann Comhairle  This is not the forum, Taoiseach.

        "answerText": " Deputy Rose Conway-Walsh  I ask this question in the context of how sole traders and self-employed people are struggling right now. I ask in particular what consideration the Tánaiste has given to raising the VAT threshold, especially in the area of services from €42,500 to try to alleviate the administrative burden on these sole traders and self-employed people. \n Deputy Barry Heneghan  I wanted to raise this as well to ask the reason a graduated----- \n An Cathaoirleach Gníomhach (Deputy John Paul O'Shea)  I am sorry Deputy, the Minister responds first and then you. \n Deputy Barry Heneghan  Sorry, I am still new to the House. \n Deputy Simon Harris  I am not and I did not know what happens.  I thank the Deputies for these questions. I propose to take Questions Nos. 8 and 15, together.  The VAT registration thresholds are, as the Deputies note, subject to the requirements of EU VAT law, with which Irish VAT law is obliged to comply. Under the directive there is an upper limit of €85,000 on registration thresholds that member states may apply. Ireland’s VAT registration thresholds are set at €85,000 for supplies of goods and €42,500, as Deputy Conway-Walsh noted, for supplies of services. These VAT goods and services thresholds were increased from €80,000 and €40,000, respectively, in the Finance Act 2024.  Even if the turnover is less than a threshold limit, a business may elect to register for VAT. Ireland’s current registration thresholds are some of the most generous thresholds in the EU, with some member states not operating any threshold, meaning all businesses are required to register for VAT. We have one of those higher thresholds. The thresholds are kept at an appropriate level to support small businesses by reducing administrative burden, but also not to cause competitive distortions or undermine tax compliance.  The VAT directive provides that member states may fix varying thresholds for different business sectors based on objective criteria. A separate threshold cannot be set for self-employed people, SMEs or family-run businesses, as an example. Thresholds must be sector-based and not based on the type of business structure. As a result, a review of the registration threshold for the self-employed is not proposed.  Budget 2026 tried to take a number of measures to assist small and medium businesses in light of the action plan on competitiveness and productivity, and the programme for Government commitments. The programme for Government commits to implementing a pro-enterprise tax policy over the course of the term. This includes commitments to deliver change to hospitality, to examine further tax credit supports for R and D and innovation, and to continue to review and simplify existing enterprise reliefs. I believe budget 2026 makes some progress in this regard.  The question is why there is a different threshold for goods and services. Ireland's VAT legislation applies different registration thresholds to the supply of goods and services. The rationale for this relates to the difference in the nature of the two supplies. In general, the value added on the supply of goods is much smaller relative to turnover compared to the supply of services, where the value added reflects the direct input of the business proprietor or staff, along with the cost of indirect inputs, such as parts. We keep both of these threshold levels under review and will continue to do so in the forthcoming budget. \n Deputy Rose Conway-Walsh  I am asking the Minister to undertake greater exploration of this. One of the reasons for this concerns the impact of inflation. We live in an environment that is constantly changing and it is important to examine these things. I am familiar with the different rates in the EU; some are higher and some are lower. In Britain, for instance, it is the same for goods and services at a straight £90,000 sterling. We need to listen to the self-employed. I try to speak to as many of the self-employed as possible. What they are saying to me is that they find it too low, given where they have to register, and that is also the case when passing it on to consumers. They say it is okay if they are trading with another business, but they might be trading with a vulnerable person or a television repair person trying to fix somebody's television, or something like that. They say that they have to pass this on, although the person in the house might not have a lot of disposable income in the first instance. \n Deputy Barry Heneghan  I would support a graduated tax system based on business size and turnover - a tiered system, like in other EU countries. I would particularly support small family-run SMEs. Is the Department examining such an approach to providing meaningful relief for community businesses? Are alternative measures being developed to ease the VAT burden on smaller enterprises? The Minister referred to this in his statement.  I also raise the issue of the burden of the cost of renewing the general employment permit after two years. It is €1,500. For a small SME, that is a lot of cups of coffee and scones to be sold to reimburse the cost. I do not think it should be as high to renew the general employment permit after two years. I can understand the initial cost, but it should be reviewed for SMEs. \n Deputy Simon Harris  I thank the Deputies for their questions. To recap my position, I have tried to outline why, to date, there has always been a policy differential in the threshold for goods and services. There is some validity to that. The Deputy is right that there are some European countries that might have a higher threshold than Ireland, but Ireland certainly has one of the higher thresholds, so we are certainly at the upper end in Europe. I am quite comfortable with that, by the way, as I think it ensures we are exempting small businesses from that administrative burden.  The Deputy did not ask directly, but I want to put this on the record of the House because it is useful for the Deputy’s work. If we were to increase the €42,500 to €85,000 for services and, in other words, equalise it, this would cost in the region of €100 million. At this stage, it is useful to put that out there.  We cannot differentiate between the self-employed and the family-run. I am not saying that is what Deputy Heneghan is looking for me to do, but I know what he is looking for me to do, which is to better support them. We want to do that. We can differentiate between the sectors but we cannot differentiate between ownership types.  I will keep under review for forthcoming budgets the broader point that Deputy Heneghan makes. We have taken some actions in this budget to try to assist small and medium businesses. Deputy Conway-Walsh referenced the selling of scones. I am very proud of the reduction that we are making to VAT in the hospitality sector, although some are not. I think it is going to make a big difference to people because it is effectively reducing the cost of running a café, a restaurant or a pub that serves lunch. At a time when there is so much external pressure on the Irish and European economy, it is prudent to try to support jobs and those who create the jobs in that sector.  We have also made changes to the R and D tax credit. That is often talked about as an FDI initiative and foreign direct investment benefits from it. Interestingly, the larger number of applications for it are from Irish companies, many of which are SMEs and microenterprises. We need to get more information out about that to further encourage the uptake. I will reflect on what both Deputies have said. \n Deputy Rose Conway-Walsh  I am very supportive of the R and D tax credit. A previous question was asked about our competitiveness. Innovation at all levels of business is very important. I am glad the Minister said it would take €100 million to bring it to €80,000 for services. The Minister may already have this information. If he does, I might ask him another question to try to get information on the position if we were to bring it to, say, €50,000, €60,000 or €70,000. It is worth examining this with regard to how we might change it. We have to remember that one of the other big things is that these people are not allowed to pay the PRSI rate that would enable them to get sickness cover or anything like that. They are often in a very vulnerable situation. I know we cannot just have it for the self-employed and sole traders. However, we need to look at this because supporting small and medium businesses, the self-employed and sole traders is important to our economy. \n Deputy Barry Heneghan  I am not asking for more supports. I know there have been a lot of them, and I am proud of some of the supports in the budget. I am asking whether the Department is examining a tiered tax system based on turnover per business, say, €300,000 to €400,000, based on the differentiation in their turnover.  The Minister spoke about supporting entrepreneurs. The current wage subsidy scheme needs to be reviewed for self-employed people with disabilities and self-employed entrepreneurs who are employing people with disabilities. Such a measure would be very welcome and long overdue. As I have stated in the House, my PA, Michael Reynolds, has a disability, but I cannot avail of the wage subsidy scheme to support him. It has not held him back. However, we need to review that for those in this House. The more people with disabilities we have near policymakers, the better we will be at dealing with and fighting for people with disabilities. If the wage subsidy scheme could be extended to Members of this House, it would really help us with that. \n Deputy Simon Harris  I was checking the figure on the R and D tax credit while the two Deputies were speaking. Some 87.5% of claimants of the R and D tax credit are SMEs, so while the greater quantum is claimed by FDI because of the size of FDI, the overwhelming number of applications is coming from SMEs. That shows it is working and has the potential to work even better.  I would make the point that we raised the thresholds in the Finance Act 2024. Both Deputies made the point but, in the past, we have done that. Of course, there are issues that can be considered in future budgets.  Both Deputies will understand that I have been Minister for Finance for a couple of weeks and that we have yet to pass the Finance Bill for this year's budget. I am not going to speculate on what will potentially be in the next one, other than to say that we can have useful debates and discussions and tease through these issues over the course of the year in the House, at committees and through parliamentary question sessions and the like, in advance of future budgets. We all want to pursue pro-enterprise policies. We have to back indigenous business. We have to continue to make our economy competitive and make it a good place to invest. We are reliant on FDI for many reasons, and those companies also benefit from being located here. However, the backbone of the Irish company has always been our indigenous industry. We all need to work together to see how we can best support that.  On the wage subsidy scheme more broadly, I am conscious that the Chair of the Oireachtas social protection committee, Deputy John Paul O’Shea, is the Acting Chair. We have published the new national disability strategy and the human rights strategy. There is a real focus in that strategy, rightly, on employment for people with disabilities.  The first meeting of the oversight group was yesterday. Deputy Heneghan's PA, Michael Reynolds, does an excellent job. I am sure good work could be done through the Oireachtas committees and through that new strategy on how we help more people with a disability to get into the workforce and how we help more businesses to hire and employ people with a disability who can make a very good contribution to their businesses. I will ask the Minister, Deputy Calleary, to link with the Deputy. ",

We have committed in the Programme for Government to expanding opportunities for pupils and students to attend Gaelscoileanna and Gaelcholáistí, to establishing Gaelscoileanna and Gaelcholáistí where there is demand, and to supporting parents choosing Irish-medium education for their children.  A new Policy for Irish-medium Education outside of the Gaeltacht was recently published by my department. A taskforce on models of provision for Irish-medium education has been established as a key action under the policy. This taskforce is facilitating collaboration between my department and stakeholders to examine the various models of Irish-medium education and to identify ways to increase the provision of Irish-medium education. Consideration of teacher supply for Irish-medium schools will be a crucial factor in the work of the taskforce and in the provision of high-quality education in the sector.  The work of this taskforce will inform the approach in considering the Irish-medium post-primary provision in areas such as Castlebar. In every area, the proximity and capacity at existing Irish-medium provision will form part of the consideration. The current good capacity at Coláiste Muire, Tuar Mhic Éadaigh, which provides post-primary education through the medium of Irish, will be relevant when examining the requirement for additional provision in the Castlebar area.

        "answerText": " The Taoiseach  I propose to take Questions Nos. 1 to 12 together.  The UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer and I both attended the recent G20 Summit in South Africa. We had a number of conversations in the margins of meetings there, including on the situation in Ukraine, on which an informal meeting of the coalition of the willing took place. Previously, I met with Prime Minister Starmer at Chequers on 12 September. We discussed a broad range of matters, including the positive state of bilateral relations between Ireland and the UK. We also discussed the legacy framework - this was one of the reasons I went to Chequers - which was published subsequently on 19 September. The Prime Minister and I took note of progress on the UK-Ireland 2030 programme of strategic co-operation since the summit on 6 March on implementation across each of the programme’s four pillars of security, justice and global issues; climate, energy and innovation; growth, trade and investment; and culture, education and people-to-people links. We looked ahead to the second UK-Ireland summit, which Ireland will host in the spring of 2026. This work complements that undertaken under the British-Irish Council, which will meet in Wales later this week, and the British-Irish Intergovernmental Conference, which took place in Dublin on 17 November.  The Prime Minister and I also discussed a range of international issues, including the catastrophic situation in Gaza. We agreed in particular on the then urgent need for a ceasefire, the release of hostages and the delivery of humanitarian aid at scale, as well as finding a pathway to a two-state solution for a lasting peace. We committed to continue to work together with the coalition of the willing to strengthen support for Ukraine and increase pressure on Russia to stop its war of aggression on the people of Ukraine.  Deputies may wish to be aware that the First Minister of Scotland, John Swinney, was in Ireland last week to mark the agreement of a new bilateral co-operation framework between Ireland and Scotland. The new framework includes six broad areas for future co-operation, including in the context of a strengthened Ireland-UK relationship. I also met with First Minister Swinney in Government Buildings during his visit. \n Deputy Brendan Smith  I have had numerous opportunities in this House to welcome in general terms the legacy framework that was agreed between the British and Irish Governments and published in early September. There is an urgent need to enact legislation to give effect to the provisions outlined in the framework. Did the Taoiseach detect an urgency or a very strong commitment from the UK Prime Minister on the need to get this issue dealt with? Many families have waited for justice for decades and decades. We have to move on and get progress on the rights, the concerns and the grief that engulfs so many families of victims for many decades now. At the end of this month, we will mark the 53rd anniversary of the Belturbet bombing, which cost the lives of two young teenagers. We also have had significant dates in relation to commemorations, for example marking the terrible atrocities in Monaghan and Dublin in May 1974. There are so many atrocities for which nobody has been brought to justice. We cannot ever attach enough urgency to trying to deal, once and for all, with legacy issues. \n Deputy Ruth Coppinger  The right to protest against the genocide in Palestine is being severely undermined the UK and this is being carried through to the North as well. I want to raise a case with the Taoiseach that he could raise with the Prime Minister. This is the case of Saoirse Wagner, a student at Queen's University in Belfast, who is being threatened with expulsion for taking part in a peaceful, calm and non-threatening protest on the issue of Palestine. The Palestine assembly in the college protested at the careers fair to highlight companies that are participating in the genocide. I think the Taoiseach will agree with me that taking part in student protest is a fundamental right and so important in our democracy. To threaten a student with their whole third level education being completely taken away for participating in a peaceful protest is something we should take a stand against. I ask the Taoiseach to make representations to the college. Saoirse is known to me. I know that she would not participate in anything violent. I ask the Taoiseach to take this case on board. \n Deputy Ruairí Ó Murchú  We are coming up to the 50th anniversary of the Dundalk bombing, which happened on 19 December 1975. Dundalk lost Hugh Watters, who was a local tailor and a well-respected man, and Jack Rooney, a fireman and a man who worked for the council. Obviously, this was devastating for their families. A memorial event has been organised by the families. It is going to happen near the courthouse, where there is a plaque, at 6.15 p.m. on Friday, 19 December. I think it is very important that we commemorate this 50th anniversary. It was the same night as the attack on Donnelly's Bar in Silverbridge where three people were killed. This was carried out by the Glenanne gang. We know this was a UVF gang which had members of the UDR and the RUC within it and obviously, the British state was up to its neck in relation to it. I would ask about the engagement around producing a framework that will actually deliver for families like these that have been failed and that Britain does not walk away from its role and its dirty war that it fought in Ireland. \n Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett  The Taoiseach said he discussed Gaza and Palestine with Keir Starmer. A standard tactic of the Israeli state has been to say that anybody who criticises Israel for genocide, apartheid, ethnic cleansing or the persecution of Palestinians, is somehow antisemitic. Keir Starmer, of course, has a record of going along with that nonsense and attacking people like Jeremy Corbyn, who is one of the most long-standing anti-racists and an absolute opponent of antisemitism. It is an outrageous accusation. We have now seen an instance of our own ambassador being dressed down by an Israeli minister, who accused the Irish people and the Irish Government of antisemitism. I would like to know what the Taoiseach thinks about that. Is he capitulating to that bullying by the Israeli state by intervening on the proposal to rename Herzog Park? This is an entirely justified proposal, given Chaim Herzog's history of involvement in ethnic cleansing of Palestinians. \n Deputy Peadar Tóibín  A series health crisis is arising in the North of Ireland at the moment. Sinn Féin, the DUP, the UUP and the Alliance Party are closing down key hospital services in Daisy Hill Hospital, Enniskillen and Causeway Hospital in Derry. These closures are having a significant effect on services. Patients in Craigavon hospital are waiting for 19 hours to see their emergency doctor. The waiting time at the emergency department in the Royal Victoria Hospital is nine hours.  One day, there were 40 ambulances stuck at hospitals trying to deliver their patients. The longest waiting time was 13 hours. I pay tribute to the SOS Causeway Hospital campaign and Gemma Brolly, who is involved in that.  The boss of the British Medical Association in the North stated that an all-Ireland GP service would be a way to help resolve these crises. Daisy Hill, Enniskillen and Causeway all have hinterlands that feed into the South of Ireland in areas where there is great need for hospital services too. Is the Taoiseach speaking to the British Prime Minister about developing an all-Ireland health service? \n Deputy Liam Quaide  When I asked the Taoiseach about flood relief for east Cork villages last week, he accused me of being sly in how I had raised the question. That adjective could be more fairly levelled at his British counterpart, Keir Starmer, who built his political career on the basis of being a human rights lawyer and unifier of the left. In power, he has enthusiastically supported the imprisonment of people for years who protest against climate inaction, along with the designation of protesters of genocide as terrorists. I fully appreciate that the UK makes its own political decisions and that we have to maintain good relations with political leaders with whom we often might have major disagreements, but it is also true that Irish citizens are affected by Starmer’s authoritarian crackdown on peaceful protests. Acclaimed novelist Sally Rooney has been prevented from collecting a prestigious Sky Arts award in person due to fears of arrest for her support of Palestine Action. Great-grandmother Máire Ní Mhurchú, originally from Douglas in Cork, was arrested in London in September, along with her sisters Gráinne and Olga, for a peaceful protest against genocide. When the Taoiseach met Keir Starmer, did he raise with him his government's aggressive and authoritarian approach to peaceful protest and its impact on Irish as well as British citizens? \n Deputy Shane Moynihan  With reference to the Taoiseach’s meeting with British Prime Minister, Keir Starmer, I note the progress made by the UK Government with regard to dealing with legacy, and I compliment Deputy Smith on his work in this area in particular.  I note the publication this week by the House of Commons Northern Ireland Affairs Committee around legacy. One of the more interesting recommendations was that Ireland needs to do more with regard to legacy. I would love to hear the Taoiseach's thoughts on that given that all of the legacy investigations of this country have been ECHR compliant, which is not necessarily something that can be said in the case of the UK.  I call for increased and accelerated action on, in particular, the Dublin and Monaghan bombings. That has been raised many times in this House and it needs to fall under the ambit of the legacy issues as well.  What engagement has the Taoiseach had with the Prime Minister on the ongoing humanitarian disaster of a crisis in Sudan, somewhere the international community needs to step up and pay attention? I wish to hear his thoughts on their engagement on that matter. \n Deputy Rose Conway-Walsh  There can be no watering-down of the commitments made in the British and Irish Governments' joined legacy framework. There are parts of that framework I question but it is very important. I welcome the Northern Ireland Affairs Committee report on this legacy legislation. The primary legislation underpinning the political framework is moving through Westminster. The bottom line is that the legislation must command the confidence of the families and be human rights compliant in order for it to properly deal with the legacy of the past. Reports that the legislation, which is already weak in parts, could be watered down are extremely concerning and will not be accepted. It is deeply concerning that any legislation would provide the British Secretary of State with the power to veto disclosure on national security grounds for family reports from the information retrieval body, the ICIR and the new legacy commission. All families and survivors have the right to have an Article 2-compliant investigation into the deaths of their loved ones. \n Deputy Paul Murphy  A new defence co-operation agreement with Britain is to be signed soon. Members of the House of Lords are saying it will mean a stronger defence relationship between Ireland and the UK. The Taoiseach himself has said there must be very close co-operation with the British when it comes to security. Does he really think that is what Irish people want? Has he forgotten that our neutrality originates from an anti-imperialist struggle against Britain, a struggle Fianna Fáll once fought for? Can he tell us what will be in this new military agreement? Britain is increasing its military expenditure by £67.7 billion. It is an active participant in the genocide in Gaza. Are we going to be expected to massively increase our military expenditure, too, as part of this new agreement? \n The Taoiseach  I thank all of the Deputies for raising a range of issues. Deputy Smith was the first to raise the issue of legacy. I believe there is a sincere commitment on behalf of the British Government as to the implementation of the legacy framework. That is shared by Prime Minister Starmer and, indeed, Secretary of State Hilary Benn, who has acted honourably in all of the negotiations and discussions in respect of the legacy framework. I visited Chequers last September specifically on legacy, along with other issues. It was important to meet with Keir Starmer on that. He has experience of the North from a former role there.  I know the Deputy has been a strong advocate on Belturbet and Monaghan and Dublin. From our perspective, it is important that the Denton report may shed some light on the Monaghan bombing and related issues Deputy Ó Murchú raised. This is relevant also to the activities of the Glennane gang and we eagerly await its publication. Operation Kenova was quite good, in my view, particularly in terms of the victims, who were very impressed with Jon Boutcher when he was in charge of Kenova. They articulated to me that he was one of the first people they met who understood where the families of the victims are coming from.  Deputy Moynihan also raised legacy. We have responsibilities in our jurisdiction. If assertions are made about us, we need to robustly deal with them, but the most effective way to do it is to make sure we respond properly to legacy. As part of the framework agreement, the British Government has, with speed, produced its legislation. That demonstrates the seriousness with which it is approaching this essential work. We are also producing legislation once the UK legislation is enacted. The Minister, Deputy O'Callaghan, has said he is hopeful the general scheme of the Bill will be published in April or May of next year. Enabling reciprocal co-operation between the two jurisdictions is at the heart of the agreed joint framework on legacy.  Additionally, as part of the joint framework agreement, the Garda Commissioner has agreed to the establishment by the end of this year of a dedicated unit as a central point of contact in relation to Troubles-related investigations undertaken by An Garda Síochána. That is an important step forward. Unionist communities in the North have always had a view. We did the Smithwick tribunal and we dealt with it quickly as part of the commitment of earlier agreements, but we do also have to be upfront in terms of the legacy framework and respond properly and comprehensively in relation to that.  I say to Deputy Ó Murchú and all those concerned about legacy that it is not about British state violence alone. It is about that, but it is also about the role of the paramilitaries, such as the Provisional IRA. I have met families of victims who have had no closure at all in terms of atrocities committed by the Provisional IRA or the Ulster loyalist groups. The focus has to be broad-based. There is an opportunity in this legacy framework to give closure to families once and for all, after decades of a lack of closure.  Deputy Coppinger raised the issue of Saoirse Wagner and asked me to talk to the Queen's University authorities. The right to protest is sacrosanct. A number of Deputies have raised this issue. Sometimes protests impede other people from doing their normal work, which is a problem. People are entitled to protest. When the war in Gaza started, I was addressing a group of 100 law students, but the objective of a protest was to stop me and to interfere with the exercise and engagement with about 100 law students. People were shouting internally, security asked them to leave and eventually they did. I was in no doubt that the whole purpose was that I would not have that engagement. Where is the balance of rights there in terms of my freedom to speak as a public representative or the freedom of people in the community to hear me? A lot of protests have crossed the line, in my opinion, with a view to stopping things happening. During a consultative forum on security challenges that I hosted as Minister for foreign affairs two years ago, the protests at that were not about protests. They were deliberately calculated to disrupt the event. \n Deputy Paul Murphy  The forum was not about consultation either, was it? \n The Taoiseach  It was a legitimate consultation. If the Deputy believes in freedom of assembly and freedom of speech, what he and like-minded people were about was stopping that from even happening.  They never complain about that. It is fair play for them to do that. There is balance here. \n Deputy Ruth Coppinger  I do not know about the protest. \n The Taoiseach  Of course the Deputy knows about the protests. She knows all about them. \n Deputy Ruth Coppinger  I have no idea what the Taoiseach is on about. \n The Taoiseach  They were on the public television, for God's sake. \n Deputy Ruth Coppinger  I do not organise every protest in Ireland. \n The Taoiseach  They were on the public television, in the media and everywhere. In this House----- \n Deputy Paul Murphy  That does not make it terrorism. \n The Taoiseach  -----assertions were made. I am not calling it that. \n An Ceann Comhairle  The Deputies are only delaying the next question. \n The Taoiseach  The point I am illustrating is that there are different forms of protest on the continuum and some of those forms are unacceptable----- \n Deputy Ruth Coppinger  We did not organise----- \n An Ceann Comhairle  Deputy, stop engaging, please. \n The Taoiseach  -----as an infringement of the rights of people generally. That is the point I am making. \n An Ceann Comhairle  The time has elapsed. \n Deputy Ruth Coppinger  I am just correcting a mistruth there. \n The Taoiseach  It is not a one-way street----- \n An Ceann Comhairle  It does not matter. \n The Taoiseach  -----all of the time. That is the point I am making. Ramming gates at Shannon Airport is not a legitimate form of protest. Stopping trade through Dublin Port is not a legitimate form of protest----- \n Deputy Ruth Coppinger  We are not. \n The Taoiseach  -----because people's livelihood depends on it. Eighty per cent of trade in this country goes through Dublin Port. Having a problem with a company is not a justification, in my view, for disrupting the entire port. I have no problem having a debate. I participated in protests as a student. I think student protests are important. \n Deputy Ruth Coppinger  Did you? \n An Ceann Comhairle  This is not a debate. \n The Taoiseach  I did, actually \n Deputy Ruth Coppinger  Okay, I will look that one up. \n The Taoiseach  The Deputy can do that. Joe Duffy was put in prison as a result of that protest. It was to do with medical cards. There you are now. Students in this country automatically had medical cards at one time. That was taken away in the eighties. The point is that legitimate protests----- \n Deputy Ruth Coppinger  Which party was that? \n An Ceann Comhairle  Ah please, Deputy, we have to get through this. \n The Taoiseach  I think it was the Deputy's former colleagues in the Labour Party. \n An Ceann Comhairle  Taoiseach, are we moving on? \n The Taoiseach  That is history. Protests happen, and I have no issue with that, but there is a continuum. I will take the Ceann Comhairle's advice.  To Deputy Ó Murchú, I have dealt with some of the legacy issues, which Deputy Conway-Walsh also raised. I will talk to Queen's University on that point. In terms of the Dundalk bombing and the Glennane gang, I hope Operation Denton will shed light on that. \n Deputy Peadar Tóibín  What about the health services? \n The Taoiseach  I will come to that. On Deputy Boyd Barrett's question, there is no relationship between the strategy and policy of the Israeli Government and my views on the renaming of Herzog Park. I have a very basic view. Throughout the history of the State, there have been namings and renamings. I am, and have been, a student of history and I taught students. I always showed them that the names of parks could be the remnants of empire or anything, but they are windows to explain the history of a given subject or personality. If we keep shutting down everything that is named after somebody, there will be no history left. \n Deputy Paul Murphy  When was it named Herzog Park? \n The Taoiseach  There will not be a history left. \n Deputy Paul Murphy  When was it named Herzog Park? It was ten or 20 years ago. \n An Ceann Comhairle  Please move on, Taoiseach. \n The Taoiseach  That is not the point. \n Deputy Paul Murphy  That is not history. \n The Taoiseach  It is, actually, if you go back through his father and before that and examine how Jewish communities came to Ireland in the first instance. There is huge history there, for God's sake. \n Deputy Paul Murphy  But not the park. \n An Ceann Comhairle  Deputy----- \n Deputy Paul Murphy  It is still history if you change the name of the park. \n The Taoiseach  As a historian and someone who is interested in history, I would be very careful. \n An Ceann Comhairle  -----you are verging on disruptive. \n The Taoiseach  Breandán Ó hEithir wrote in Lig Sinn i gCathú about the thirties when places were being shut down left, right and centre. \n An Ceann Comhairle  Seven more Deputies, Taoiseach. \n The Taoiseach  There is a lot more to it than that, but it has nothing to do with this. I can put Deputy Boyd Barrett at ease in that regard. \n An Ceann Comhairle  There are seven more Deputies to answer, Taoiseach. \n The Taoiseach  By the way, I object, like the Deputy does, to Israel's consistent messaging that if you are not onside, you are offside or antisemitic. That is wrong. You are entitled to be against Israeli Government policy and criticise it and not be labelled antisemitic. That is absolutely correct and I support it.  Deputy Tóibín should talk to his former colleagues in Sinn Féin in earnest and engage with them on the health services in Northern Ireland. That is one issue. There are broader problems with the National Health Service generally, but there are real issues in Northern Ireland. There is no question about the pressures on the health service there. \n Deputy Peadar Tóibín  There are benefits to an all-Ireland health service. \n An Ceann Comhairle  Deputy, this is not a continuous back-and-forth. I am not allowing that. This is Taoiseach's Questions. The Deputy has asked a question and is getting an answer. \n The Taoiseach  Under the shared island initiative, we are trying to do specific projects and programmes, for example in paediatric and cardiovascular health, cardiac surgery and the cancer centre at Altnagelvin hospital. Those are good programmes that have worked very well.  Deputy Quaide referred to Prime Minister Starmer. I do not see him as an authoritarian person when I meet him. I spoke about the continuum of protest. I am not au fait with British security services or why they came to do what they did in respect of Palestine Action. We have proceeded differently in this country. When I meet Prime Minister Starmer, I will have an opportunity to deal fundamentally with a range of issues although we cannot deal with every single issue. The UK has had challenges on both sides of the political spectrum in respect of protests and the nature of those protests.  I dealt with the points raised by Deputy Shane Moynihan about Operation Denton. The Sudan issue is one I have raised consistently with leaders, including publicly, at the G20 summit and at the Africa-European Union summit. It is catastrophic. It rarely gets mentioned in this House, but 12 million people have been displaced. Genocide against the civilian population is happening there. Some of the rebel forces are being supported by neighbouring countries with arms and so forth.  To respond to Deputy Conway-Walsh, the framework is Article 2 compliant. It is far stronger than its predecessor as a legacy Bill.  Deputy Murphy raised the new co-operation agreement. It absolutely makes sense that we co-operate very closely with the United Kingdom on the gas connectors, for example. Those are a huge security vulnerability for both the UK and Ireland, but particularly for Ireland. Within a week, our economy would come to a standstill if anything untoward were to happen to those interconnectors. I hope the Deputy would agree that we should have close defence co-operation for our economic security, in particular, and for our subsea cables. That will mean a lot of technological co-operation. When a Russian shadow fleet crosses over those pipes or subsea cables, very often divers have to go down and check that the pipes are okay. That is co-operation. Letting people know that somebody who might be up to not good is in your terrain is co-operation. Intelligence services sharing information about terrorists or potential attacks is co-operation. There should be no big deal about co-operation.  By the way, on the origin of our neutrality, it was not an anti-imperialist origin. In fact, at the consultative forum, there was a very good seminar on our neutrality and its origins. Obviously, the Second World War was at the core. We were neutral in not having issues with Britain and the occupation of Northern Ireland and so on, but the more fundamental issue was that it was a neutrality of survival. No one was in a position to defend Ireland in 1939, 1940 or 1941. There were good presentations made at that consultative forum but Deputy Murphy boycotted it because he felt it was not worthwhile. It would have been informative had he gone. It would have provided a more nuanced view----- \n Deputy Paul Murphy  It is a shame the Taoiseach scrapped the idea of a citizens' assembly. \n The Taoiseach  -----of the origins of our neutrality. \n An Ceann Comhairle  I thank the Taoiseach and ask him to move to the next question. \n The Taoiseach  I apologise. I thank the Ceann Comhairle for her tolerance. \n An Ceann Comhairle  It is not my tolerance. I get complaints at the Business Committee that this forum is not working. We are going to take it to the Dáil reform committee for change. ",

        "answerText": " The Taoiseach  I propose to take Questions Nos. 13 to 23, inclusive, together.  Regulation, and the extent of any regulatory or administrative burden, has recently become a greater focus at European Union level and nationally as a means to further enhance competitiveness. At a European level, both simplification and implementation are important Commission priorities. The Commission is striving to simplify and lighten the administrative burden of European Union regulations to ensure they are proportionate, stable, coherent and technologically neutral.  Likewise, our national regulatory framework is a central focus for the Government as we strive to support competitiveness at a time of international economic uncertainty. In line with the programme for Government, we published an action plan on competitiveness and productivity on 10 September this year. The action plan includes actions across government to ensure the development of a more effective regulatory system which will support economic growth.  These actions reflect priority areas where targeted public policy intervention can have the greatest impact. These include a red-tape challenge to reduce regulation for SMEs; the application of the SME test by Government Departments to all measures, in particular policy initiatives where it is proposed to increase costs on small businesses; expediting the Environmental (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill; commencing reforms, as we have done, under the Planning and Development Act 2024 to enhance delivery of infrastructure; and implementing the outstanding recommendations from the review of the administration of civil justice review group report.  Increased regulatory burden has also been identified as a barrier to infrastructure development and delivery. The Minister, Deputy Chambers, supported by the work of the accelerating infrastructure task force, this morning, with Government colleagues including me, the Tánaiste and the Minister of State, Deputy Harkin, published a plan which will include extensive regulatory reforms aimed at accelerating the delivery of critical infrastructure.  Today's plan provides the blueprint to reduce complexity and blockages in the system and deliver infrastructure with urgency. The changes we are initiating today are vital if we are to maintain our competitive position in an ever uncertain world. They are also necessary to support our citizens with top class public services, job security, access to housing and all other facilities necessary to enjoy the stability and good quality of life we are all entitled to expect.  The actions are ambitious but achievable, and delivering them will require commitment and co-operation across a broad and diverse range of stakeholders, from political, legal and public sectors, industry and society as a whole. We have established a cost-of-business advisory forum where business owners and representative bodies can speak directly to decision-makers about the real-world impact of regulations, fees and operational challenges. The work of that forum is under way. The Minister, Deputy McEntee, is working on the simplification omnibus packages put forward by the European Commission in a range of policy areas, most recently the Commission's digital simplification omnibus package, which was published last month.  My Department will play a co-ordinating role across these different regulatory reform initiatives, as outlined in the action plan on competitiveness and productivity, including the establishment of a central economic regulators' forum, and we will work with the Minister for Enterprise, Tourism and Employment and other Government colleagues on that agenda. \n Deputy Tony McCormack  I thank the Taoiseach for his response. I acknowledge the significant work he, the Minister, Deputy Chambers, and their two Departments are doing on infrastructure reform, particularly the steps being taken to modernise planning, reduce delays and ensure major projects move forward. Infrastructure reform is vital, but businesses and especially SMEs are also calling for a more streamlined regulatory environment. These firms consistently cite overlapping rules, slow approvals and heavy administrative demands as major obstacles to growth. Building on the work already happening on infrastructure, will the Taoiseach update the House on what specific measures his Department is pursuing to simplify compliance for SMEs, reduce unnecessary paperwork and make it easier for businesses to operate and expand? How will these reforms help to lower costs for employers and the taxpayer by making the system more efficient overall? \n Deputy Albert Dolan  It is vital that when we speak about regulatory reform, we talk about the administrative operations of existing systems in the function of the State. I will specifically reflect on the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland, SEAI, and the roll-out of grants. We are about to have a debate in this Chamber on energy costs. One thing that is vital is that the best way the Government can help to reduce energy costs in homes is to retrofit them for the future so that they simply do not need as much energy. That is the number one way to reduce the cost and it facilitates homes to be more efficient and takes pressure off the grid. The Government needs to do something to accelerate the rate at which homes can be retrofitted by the SEAI. For many constituents in my constituency, it is taking too long to get through the process of approval of the grant to construction. \n Deputy Ruairí Ó Murchú  We all accept there are huge issues with bureaucracy and red tape in planning. We should have seen simplification and streamlining. Conversations about this are occurring across Europe, but we know about the home-grown issues. It is an issue I have brought up previously, even within the planning systems involving State authorities. For example, Louth County Council is involved in the Ardee Education Together National School build and a particular issue has arisen. We do not have enough agility in the system. Multiple requests have gone in stating that there are not enough parking spaces. There are 21 spaces, including three disability spaces. There are only two set-down spaces for minibuses and there is a need for five as there are five autism spectrum disorder, ASD, classes and there is not even room for a full-size 52-seater bus to turn. There are 21 spaces for staff and there is a need for something closer to 40. \n An Ceann Comhairle  Thank you, Deputy. \n Deputy Ruairí Ó Murchú  It is possible to get this work done at this time, but if the works continue as planned, the problem will still need to be fixed but it could take more than €100,000, so we need something to be done. \n Deputy Darren O'Rourke  I raise the regulation of social media companies in the online space, particularly as it relates to children. The criticism that has been levelled at Coimisiún na Meán's online safety code is that an earlier draft had a recommendation that social media companies turn off recommender systems and it has been removed. Recommender systems profile people who are using apps and then drive them down often hateful and dangerous rabbit holes. It is not healthy for them or society. Will this be looked at? \n Deputy Ruth Coppinger  I raise regulatory reform of immigration and particularly family reunification. It is now being made much harder for many essential workers to be unified with their families, in particular migrant healthcare assistants who were brought over here on a visa programme and are working in private nursing homes. Last week on RTÉ radio, the Minister for justice was asked by the presenter whether these people are not entitled to a normal family life. They are caring for our older people and we have to show we care for them. The Minister's reply was that no one is forcing them to come here. That is absolutely heartless, shows zero empathy and is also completely counterproductive because many of them are nurses. They could go to other countries, but they have come to Ireland and are working below their grades or qualifications, giving huge added value to the nursing homes. I urge the Taoiseach to have a heart. We had a briefing here a few years ago, which Deputy Michael Healy-Rae attended because he knew the value of those healthcare assistants in nursing homes. These are essential workers and they will go elsewhere. \n An Ceann Comhairle  Thank you, Deputy. \n Deputy Ruth Coppinger  Please entitle them to have a normal family life. These mothers should not be separated from their kids. \n Deputy Paul Murphy  The programme for Government says the Government will move responsibility for the Multi-Unit Developments, MUD, Acts to the Department of housing from the Department of justice and establish a unit in the Housing Agency to regulate owners' management companies, OMCs, to ensure effective governance. That is important work that needs to happen. The problem is that it is not happening currently, but it has been agreed. Effectively what is holding it up is that, as a result of the Mulcreevy judgment, the primary legislation needs to be changed. At the moment, the MUD Act refers to the Minister for justice and not the Minister for housing. A simple amendment is needed to change the reference to the Minister for housing. Until that happens, all this work of regulatory oversight of OMCs and so on is simply not taking place. There was a meeting of the housing committee to discuss these issues. It invited various officials from the Department of housing and was told they could not come yet because their line Minister is not yet responsible for this. \n An Ceann Comhairle  Thank you, Deputy. \n Deputy Paul Murphy  The Housing Agency has not been allocated funding for doing any regulatory work as a result. This needs urgent action. \n Deputy Liam Quaide  There was a health committee session last week on the regulation of counselling and psychotherapy. In standards it has published, CORU has adopted a position that is entirely at odds with the main representative groups of those disciplines, which will reduce supervision requirements and remove mandatory personal therapy for trainees. These changes, if implemented, will degrade professional standards and undermine patient safety. CORU is showing a remarkable level of intransigence on these fundamentals of safe practice. Practitioners and representative bodies have warned that the proposals could also jeopardise recognition and mobility across the EU for counsellors and psychotherapists. We must protect high-quality training, preserve public confidence and ensure regulation strengthens, not weakens, these services.  I am not expressing some fringe opinion. The health committee was unanimous in supporting the counselling and psychotherapy representative groups and the session included some strong and insightful contributions from the Taoiseach's party colleagues, including Senator Costello. Will the Government immediately pause the CORU process, bring representative bodies and practitioners into full consultation and commit to reforms that prioritise client safety and high professional standards? \n Deputy Rose Conway-Walsh  I will talk about the regulation of quarries. The Taoiseach knows the price we have paid in this country and the price that families affected by the defective concrete blocks scandal have paid due to a lack of regulation.  Many of the homeowners I have spoken to in Mayo are not satisfied with the current regulations of quarries and in particular, that geologists are not examining the aggregate within the quarries that are being used to build homes now. I ask the Taoiseach to have a look at this area to see what can be done in that regard. It can be easily fixed by engaging and employing geologists to do the job and to make sure that people have confidence in the materials that are coming out of quarries. \n Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett  The Taxi Regulation Act 2013 clearly gives the Minister the power to impose regulations around the activities of dispatch companies. Today, for the third time in two weeks, taxi drivers in Dublin are protesting. There is a widespread protest against this across the country by taxi drivers over the behaviour of Uber, a multimillion euro company, that is trying to undermine the livelihood of nearly 20,000 taxi drivers by introducing a fixed fare system. This will undermine the regulated fare structure and therefore the livelihoods of taxi drivers and ultimately the industry itself. In the long run, as is clear from Uber's behaviour elsewhere in the world, it will not benefit the customer. Once the company gets hold of a market, fares and charges go up and the livelihoods of taxi drivers get smashed. Will the Taoiseach ask the Minister for Transport to impose such regulations to prevent Uber destroying the industry and livelihoods of taxi drivers around this fixed fare system and enforce the taxi regulation and meter stuff? \n The Taoiseach  Deputy McCormack raised infrastructure reform, particularly for small to medium-sized businesses. Some of the measures we have taken in respect of deferring the alignment of the minimum wage with the national living wage will help to avoid the escalation of costs because the SME sector has borne the brunt of a lot of additional costs over the past five years. There is no doubt the reduction in VAT on hospitality will help a lot of SMEs in the hospitality sector and hairdressing as well. The number of sick days leave is going to be quickly expanded. We have expanded it to three days. The cumulative cost of everything has been fairly excessive. The Small Business Forum is there to try to balance imposition on small business as well as the cost.  The other issue is the sequential approach to planning and regulations as opposed to a concurrent approach whereby instead of waiting for the planning to be done, agencies do the procurement. Instead of waiting for environmental assessments, doing them all in parallel would speed up a lot of activity. In many instances, we are constantly looking at the avoidance of increased cost for SMEs and trying to slow down the increased costs that have come their way. It is interesting the rate of youth employment has crept up in the past six to nine months. I believe that is related to costs on SMEs.  Deputy Dolan is correct that retrofitting is the most effective way to reduce costs. Between 2019 and September 2025, the Government provided over €1.5 billion in support to homeowners for over 228,000 upgrades, including 30,000 fully funded retrofits under the warmer homes scheme. It is estimated that if a deep retrofit is done, it can save a household up to €1,100 per year in energy costs. I get the Deputy's point that the administration of it needs to be faster. There is also resource demand in respect of it as well with some people not being able to afford to do retrofits because of the cost.  On Deputy Ó Murchú's issue, I do not have the specifics on Ardee Educate Together National School. I do not know what the interaction with the county council is, but in any event----- \n Deputy Ruairí Ó Murchú  The refusal to change----- \n The Taoiseach  They should sort it out. A school is an important facility. The county council should be facilitative in the building of a school. \n Deputy Ruairí Ó Murchú  It is not just the council. \n The Taoiseach  Deputy O'Rourke raised regulation online. We have now established the regulatory framework governing online. There is ongoing review in respect of it. Children must be protected. That has to be the optimal.  Deputy Coppinger raised healthcare assistants and family reunification. We have significant reunification in Ireland under our migration system, in particular when people leave direct provision who have residency. The Minister will bring forward legislation in respect of this and these are issues we can discuss in greater detail at that stage.  On Deputy Murphy's point, I will talk to the Ministers responsible. There has to be proper regulation of management companies. There are fundamental rights involved in terms of those complexes. I will pursue that with the Minister and see where we are in terms of amendment to primary legislation.  Deputy Quaide raised the issue of counselling and psychotherapy. On qualification frameworks and regulators generally, we want more therapists, but they have to be highly qualified. Public health is number one and the protection of the consumer. In some instances, they can be quite protectionist as well. The judgment called for regulators and I would like CORU to get the judgment right in terms of not having the bar so high that there are only highly qualified, and others are not. That is not just in terms of therapy and counselling; that is in terms of teaching and a range of other issues.  Deputy Conway-Walsh raised the regulation of quarries. I will talk to the Minister involved in that. We can overregulate too but I take the Deputy's point about the quality of aggregate and quality of the product. There are existing systems to deal with that. The SEAI is there. There are various regulatory bodies to deal with the quality of materials, but I will talk to the Minister in respect of that. New bodies were set up after the defective blocks scheme.  Deputy Boyd Barrett raised taxi regulation. I will talk to the Minister about the issues that the Deputy raised. There is a balance between consumers, those availing of taxis and the regulation of same. We had regulation a long time ago; it did not work. There was always an imbalance between supply and demand. I will look at this and will talk to the Minister for Transport in respect of it. He is fully aware of it. \n An Ceann Comhairle  We have a delegation of students visiting from Ukraine as our part of our EPAS programme hosted by Maynooth Post Primary School. They are most welcome. We had their president here yesterday, which we enjoyed immensely. ",

Along with EU and like-minded international partners, the Irish Government has expressed concerns about the shadow fleet, which engages in illegal operations for the purpose of circumventing sanctions on Russian oil, evades compliance with insurance, safety or environmental regulations and which poses environmental, maritime safety and security risks, including to critical subsea infrastructure, by engaging in illegal activities. The Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade engages regularly with partners on efforts to counter the shadow fleet.  Ireland fully supported the 19th package of sanctions against Russia, published last month, which included provision for a ban on imports of Russian liquefied natural gas, and a port access ban on more shadow fleet vessels.  I attended the meeting of the Foreign Affairs Council in Brussels on 20 November, where EU Foreign Ministers discussed a range of issues, including Russian aggression against Ukraine. This included a discussion on ways to increase pressure on Russia, including through measures to disrupt the shadow fleet.  At the FAC meeting, I expressed Ireland’s support for efforts to further counter the shadow fleet, including through consideration of further sanctions. I welcomed the work of the EU Sanctions Envoy, Mr. David O’Sullivan, in this regard. I informed partners of the development, by the Department of Defence, of Ireland’s first Maritime Security Strategy, which will have a focus on protecting critical subsea infrastructure as well as enhanced maritime domain awareness, including through strengthening international cooperation frameworks.  The Defence Forces lead on and continue to carry out monitoring and surveillance of Ireland’s EEZ using Naval Service assets and Air Corps maritime patrol aircraft. In addition to at-sea monitoring, the Naval Operations Command Centre in Haulbowline carries out remote monitoring 24 hours a day, seven days a week. ",

        "answerText": " Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine  ACRES includes results-based payments to participants in the Scheme's 'Co-operation' approach and in respect of certain actions in its 'General' approach.  Approximately 1.1 million hectares of land has been assessed and scored, representing 25% of all agricultural land, and including over 400,000 hectares of commonage.  The relevant parcels and commonage lands to be assessed and scored for the purposes of results-based payments were specified by ACRES participants at the time of application.  Ten scorecards were developed by my Department, in conjunction with the ACRES Co-operation Project (CP) Teams, to facilitate the assessment and scoring of lands.  The scorecards include positive indicators such as plant species, vegetation structure and wetness. They also include threats and pressures such as exposed soil, and damaging activities, such as turbary activity. These scorecards also capture management advice to improve the habitat, allowing farmers to improve the score and, ultimately, their payments.  As regards the assignment of the commonage scorecards, the boundaries of the scorecards were set based on a walkover in year one of the Scheme.  The Department was very conscious that active turf-cutting could potentially have a disproportionate impact on commonage scores, particularly if the commonage is scored as one field and there is a high level of active peat cutting and associated works.  That is why my Department, together with the CP Teams, developed a protocol for the CP teams to ensure that turbary and non-turbary areas were assessed separately. This protocol maintains the environmental integrity of ACRES - and the environmental integrity of the wider CAP Strategic Plan, which is paramount - while also ensuring that ACRES participants are not unduly penalised for active turbary carried out by third parties.  As the boundaries of the scorecards were set based on a walkover in Year one of the Scheme, it is not possible to redraw scorecard boundaries in commonage in subsequent years where new turbary activity takes place or where turbary activity has expanded without undermining the environmental integrity of the scheme, as the scoring system is set to disincentivise expansion of active turbary areas.  It should be noted that there is a review process in place in relation to the scoring of commonage, with the procedure in relation to that review process, and associated forms, available on my Department’s website.

        "answerText": " The Taoiseach  I propose to take Questions Nos. 1 to 13, inclusive, together.  The Cabinet subcommittee on Northern Ireland was created on 18 February 2025 to oversee implementation of relevant programme for Government commitments and ongoing developments in relation to Northern Ireland, Irish-British relations, and the shared island initiative. As well as considering issues relevant to the Government's position as a co-guarantor of the Good Friday Agreement, including our role in Good Friday Agreement institutions such as the North-South Ministerial Council, the British-Irish Council and the British-Irish Intergovernmental Conference, topics for discussion also include the annual UK-Ireland summits and their agreed programme of work and the continued roll-out and development of the investment, research and dialogue strands of the shared island initiative.  On 17 October, I chaired the 30th plenary meeting of the North-South Ministerial Council in Farmleigh House, Dublin. The Northern Ireland Executive was led by the First Minister, Michelle O'Neill, MLA, and the deputy First Minister, Emma Little-Pengelly, MLA. We had constructive discussions on areas of mutual issues, including business and trade matters, infrastructure and investment co-operation, and tackling gender-based violence. Our discussion also included a new agenda item on emergency planning and preparedness. We also had updates by all Ministers on North-South co-operation under their portfolios, ranging from day-to-day cross-Border engagement to major infrastructural projects. The event was preceded by a dinner at Farmleigh with Government and Northern Ireland Ministers on 16 October.  On 18 November, the Government announced allocations of over €50 million from the shared island fund for ten new projects to be delivered as part of the initiative over 2026 to 2030. Among the projects are €14 million for a major new shared island media initiative to be taken forward by Coimisiún na Meán, €5.9 million to develop cross-Border emergency management capacity on flood response and rescue operations, particularly with resources for technology and so forth, and €2 million to enable a new Dublin-Derry PSO air service to start in 2026.  Next week, along with the Tánaiste, I will attend a summit meeting of the British-Irish Council in Wales where the focus of our discussions will be on the creative industries across these islands. The Cabinet committee on Northern Ireland will continue to meet biannually on these and related matters. We will be meeting again next on 8 December. \n An Ceann Comhairle  I ask Members to please be brief and concise, as the Taoiseach needs to respond. \n Deputy Brendan Smith  I thank the Taoiseach for his reply. As he is aware, there was a general welcome for the legacy framework that was published jointly by the Irish and British Governments in early September. Could he let us know what progress is being made in bringing forward the necessary legislation to enact that framework and to ensure that all of these issues are dealt with through putting the victims first and at the centre of the framework and the modus operandi of dealing with these legacy issues?  Another thing I have consistently raised is the Belturbet bombing of December 1972 and the Dublin-Monaghan bombings of 1974. Again, the British Government has not co-operated to the extent necessary to ensure a comprehensive investigation into the Dublin-Monaghan bombings. Will the Taoiseach let us know if that will continue to be on the agenda in all discussions at Government level with his British counterparts? \n Deputy Erin McGreehan  I would like the Taoiseach to outline whether the Cabinet committee discussed the cross-Border economy, particularly in counties such as Louth where these issues are felt most acutely. Will there be specific actions in relation to tax and administrative complications facing cross-Border workers, including the differentiations between the pricing of alcohol and fuel between both jurisdictions and the impact of that in the distortion of local trade and the undermining of businesses and broader communities?  I support my colleague Deputy Smith in relation to the bombings. I also highlight that it will have been 50 years this December since the Dundalk bombing where people tragically lost their lives. \n Deputy Barry Heneghan  Regarding the cross-Border organisation Foras na Gaeilge, if it had the same growth as the Arts Council, Foras na Gaeilge's budget would now be €50 million. Instead of that, níl sé ach €17 milliún. I welcome the raise in the recent budget to Foras na Gaeilge's funding, but how will the Taoiseach ensure that this additional funding is made available, given that 25% of it is from the North? \n Deputy Ruairí Ó Murchú  I have often brought up the positives regarding the shared island unit. I believe the project in relation to DkIT and its partnership with Queen's University Belfast could fit into that. However, a number of other issues arise, whether we are talking about the remote working issues that have an impact on taxation or exam certification. In fairness to Deputy McGreehan, she has brought up the issue of the disparity regarding fuel. I have spoken before about the need for some sort of means of putting these issues on the agenda properly and dealing with them.  We have made the call for a long time to get down to the issue of constitutional change and the need for a means - call it a citizens' assembly or a forum - by which this conversation can happen. The State must properly prepare for Irish unity. There has been an abject failure to do so and we cannot just wait until everybody gets on together. We need to prepare now and the onus is on the State to do it. \n Deputy Cormac Devlin  I thank the Taoiseach for the update on the work of the Cabinet subcommittee. As Cathaoirleach of the Committee on the Implementation of the Good Friday Agreement, we have had good engagements North and South. That is continuing next week with visiting MPs from Westminster. Dialogue is important in terms of the Government's good relationship with London as well as Belfast.  May I also raise the case of the 265 students and teachers who were kidnapped in Niger state in Nigeria? It is a very serious case and I would like to know what is happening there. \n Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett  Last week, I raised with the Taoiseach - I want to do so again because it is important - the fact that, as part of a wider attack by the British Government on those standing in solidarity with the people of Palestine and against Israel's genocide in Gaza, people in the North are being arrested and charged, including one of our councillors, Councillor Shaun Harkin in Derry, for indicating supporting support for Palestine Action. The designation by the Starmer Government of Palestine Action as a terrorist group is outrageous when what the group has been trying to do is stop Israeli terrorism and genocide by trying to disrupt the ability of the British state and Israeli companies to collaborate with Israel in the genocidal assault on the people of Palestine. It is happening in the North. Arrests are taking place. There was a protest this weekend where people declared their support for Palestine Action. It should not be a chargeable offence and the Taoiseach should speak out against it. \n Deputy Paul Murphy  For 15 months, an Irish citizen from County Antrim has been held without trial in an English prison and has had his rights denied. Jordan Devlin is being locked inside for 23 and a half hours per day. He is being strip searched twice daily. His mail has been withheld, his visits are blocked and his calls are denied. His sister said, \"They put him on public protection so he can't speak to anyone\". She also said:  They often don’t have vegetarian food so he can't eat. They're x-raying him and strip-searching him twice a day. He's freezing too.  He is a Palestine solidarity activist. He is charged with regard to a protest action at Elbit Systems. Elbit is the largest supplier of weapons to the Israeli genocide. He denies all the charges. His trial begins today but his judge was swapped out yesterday with no stated justification. The question is whether the Irish Government has made any representations on his behalf and whether the Taoiseach has sought to ensure that his basic rights as a prisoner and a defendant are defended as opposed to being ridden roughshod over like many other Palestine protesters. \n Deputy Ivana Bacik  I thank the Taoiseach for the update. I welcome the developments with the shared island fund. It is now clearer than it has ever been that conversations about the constitutional future of the island are picking up steam. I would dispute the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland's recent claim that there was no appetite for constitutional change in Northern Ireland. I see that the leader of the SDLP Claire Hanna and others contested that claim. In the absence of leadership from the British Government and in keeping with the principles in the Good Friday Agreement-Belfast Agreement, it is essential for our Government to take on a role of preparing in earnest for the work necessary to lay the groundwork and foundations for running a referendum on unity. We need a clear timeline to allow for that necessary groundwork to take place, to develop Green and White Papers, to allow for the work of citizens' assemblies to take place and to see progress made building on the work of the shared island unit in advance of the 30th anniversary of the Good Friday Agreement-Belfast Agreement. The Taoiseach said that the next meeting of the Cabinet subcommittee would be on 8 December. As we approach 2028, what substantive steps will that Cabinet subcommittee be announcing in terms of bringing the debate further? \n Deputy Rose Conway-Walsh  At last week's session of the Committee on the Implementation of the Good Friday Agreement, we had a profound contribution from the All-Island Cancer Research Institute and the All-Island Congenital Heart Disease Network. It highlighted once again what we have known for some time, namely, that lives can be saved and healthcare can only be delivered to an optimum level across the island when we have an all-island approach to healthcare for the 7 million people living on the island. It makes zero sense on a small island such as ours financially or otherwise to have two healthcare systems operating simultaneously. Until such time as we have a referendum on Irish unity and an opportunity to design a new and modern all-island, world-class service, I ask the Taoiseach and the Minister for Health to set aside a permanent allocation in the health budget for the delivery of healthcare on an all-island basis, utilising North-South collaboration to improve outcomes for patients in both jurisdictions and maximise the wonderful clinical expertise on the island. \n Deputy Eoin Hayes  The renewed calls for a border poll on reunification in recent months point to a definite direction of travel on the issue of a united Ireland and on that question moving from the realm of the idealistic to the practical. My party and I would welcome the opportunity to advocate for reunification and believe that a united Ireland achieved by truly informed communities North and South in a process defined by consent and deliberative consensus has the real potential to benefit the people of the entire island. However, I am concerned that as the chances of a border poll in the next ten or 15 years continue to rise to that of political inevitability, we are running out of time to ensure it takes place in such an environment. Will the Government commit to the establishment of citizens' assemblies, work towards cross-Border fora on health, economics and education and set out a positive vision? \n Deputy Peadar Tóibín  The purpose of the British legacy Bill was to grant to amnesty to those who had killed innocent civilians. There appears to be a significant contradiction in the position of the Irish and British Governments in the new joint framework that seeks to replace that. The British Government is briefing that there will be safeguards for British army veterans. I asked Simon Harris this question and he said that was separate from the joint framework and that the British were looking for their own safeguards in their own legislation. Would that separate treatment for British army veterans not undermine a joint framework? Would it not create a lop-sided justice system in the Six Counties? Will that protection for veterans apply to both sides of the conflict? Will the British secretary of state retain a veto over the disclosure of the role of paid British agents in the Troubles and will former RUC officers who played a significant role in the Troubles be part of the investigative system that is put in place? \n Deputy Conor D. McGuinness  Tá Coimisinéir Teanga nua ceaptha sna Sé Chontae, Pól Deeds. Is coiscéim chun tosaigh é seo i ndiaidh tréimhse an-fhada ag feitheamh dá leithéid. Tá Gaeilge agus pobal na Gaeilge faoi ionsaí sna Sé Chontae faoi láthair. Conas a dhéanfaidh an Taoiseach cosaint ar an bpobal seo, ar lucht labhartha na Gaeilge ó Thuaidh?  While I am on my feet, I want to raise the situation of Jordan Devlin, an Irish citizen from County Antrim who is on remand in Britain awaiting charges relating to pro-Palestinian activism there. I see this in the wider context of a crackdown on political dissent and political protest in Britain. Has the Taoiseach raised, or will he raise, this situation with the British authorities to ensure he is treated fairly in prison and will be afforded a fair trial? \n The Taoiseach  I thank all of the Deputies for raising a variety of issues. Deputy Brendan Smith was first up. In respect of the legacy framework, the measures announced in the joint framework were published in September and provide a pathway to truth and accountability. That is why I went to London to meet Keir Starmer. It was one of those trips. I take it that people accept that we have to go to London every now and again to meet the Prime Minister. It was to make sure we got the legacy Bill over the line because it is an important piece of legislation that is certainly far superior to the previous legacy Act of the last British Government.  The British Government published the Bill amending the 2023 legacy Act on 14 October, so that is the progress the Deputy was asking for. The second reading of that Bill took place in the House of Commons on 18 November. To be fair, we believe that represents speed and demonstrates the seriousness with which they are approaching this essential work. The key test for us will be whether it faithfully reflects what is in the joint framework. The Minister, Deputy McEntee, and the UK secretary of state, Hilary Benn, discussed the legacy framework in their introductory call last week.  The Tánaiste and the Minister, Deputy O'Callaghan, also discussed this with the secretary of state, Mr. Benn, at the British-Irish Intergovernmental Conference, which took place on 17 November because we, too, have responsibilities in this jurisdiction. While we can only legislate once the UK legislation is enacted, the Minister for justice, Jim O'Callaghan, has said he is hopeful that the general scheme of the Bill will be published in April or May of next year. Enabling reciprocal co-operation between the two jurisdictions is absolutely at the heart of the agreed joint framework on legacy. The Garda Commissioner is also committed to the establishment by the end of this year of a dedicated unit as a central point of contact in relation to Troubles-related investigations undertaken by An Garda Síochána. That is also in the joint framework. An Garda Síochána has also committed, where possible, to answer questions that a family may have in relation to the investigation of a Troubles-related incident and provide a report to the family.  In respect of the Belturbet and Dublin-Monaghan bombings, the publication of the Denton report may very well shed light on the Dublin-Monaghan bombings. We have to await the outcome of that. I know it is into the Glenanne Gang and the atrocities they perpetrated, but that will be important. I know that Deputy Smith has been a strong advocate on the Belturbet and Dublin-Monaghan bombings.  Deputy McGreehan raised a very important point about the treatment for tax purposes of workers who cross the Border. We do not have that resolved yet. There have been ongoing issues, or attempts to do that, between the respective Departments of finance and I am pushing through the cross-Border bodies and through the Department of Finance to get some progress on that. We are also working with employers and unions through the LEEF process to see can we make progress on it. It is an issue for the seamless transfer of workers North to South and South to North.  It is more difficult in terms of harmonisation of prices North and South. Different Governments have different policies. I have not seen today's budget in respect of the UK yet but that could even bring in more taxation. We do not know how that will manifest.  I am conscious also that it is 50 years since the Dundalk bombing.  Maidir le ceist an Teachta Heneghan, tá deacracht ann toisc an gaol atá ann. Tá dualgas ar an Executive airgead a chur ar fáil d’Fhoras na Gaeilge agus caithfimid an rud céanna a dhéanamh. Is féidir linn níos mó a chur ar fáil. Trí shared island, tá níos mó á dhéanamh againn, maraon leis an méid atá ag teacht go hoifigiúil ón Rialtas, chun gnóthaí trí Ghaeilge a chothú agus tacaíocht a thabhairt. Mar sin beimid ag déanamh sin. I will come back to the shared island initiative later.  Deputy Ó Murchú and others raised constitutional issues and so on. I think reconciliation cannot be postponed, Deputy. \n Deputy Ruairí Ó Murchú  I did not say it could be. \n The Taoiseach  The Deputy kind of said we could not wait. \n Deputy Ruairí Ó Murchú  The Taoiseach said waiting on a perfect----- \n The Taoiseach  I know. I am not trying to----- \n Deputy Ruairí Ó Murchú  He said we wait on a perfect----- \n An Ceann Comhairle  Deputy, please. The Taoiseach is answering the questions. \n The Taoiseach  I just think we need to really focus on reconciliation on a constant, constant basis. \n Deputy Ruairí Ó Murchú  That is okay. \n The Taoiseach  It is hard work but it does bear great fruit in terms of the North and South and different traditions and political backgrounds within the North as well. \n Deputy Peadar Tóibín  It is more likely to happen in a united Ireland. \n An Ceann Comhairle  Deputy, this is not a back and forth. \n The Taoiseach  It is very important that we consistently do that. I do not think citizens' assemblies are in any shape or form an appropriate route for discussing the future of Ireland or the constitutional framework into the future. \n Deputy Ruairí Ó Murchú  In a forum. \n Deputy Peadar Tóibín  The New Ireland Forum. \n The Taoiseach  I just do not believe it at all, because anyone who knows anything about the North - and I have been involved all my life politically; I have been involved in discussions about the devolution of justice, for example, and I was in the Government when the Good Friday Agreement was first signed - knows it means people-to-people engagement. It means political parties engaging. It means political traditions as well as independent politicians or people who have a view. Citizens' assemblies can be closed enough in some respects and they can be a percentage of a random percentage of the population. There were some good citizens' assemblies but for something as overarching as a future constitutional framework - I just want to give my view on this - from my experience, it simply would not cut it. You would end up with a report----- \n Deputy Peadar Tóibín  The New Ireland Forum. \n Deputy Ruairí Ó Murchú  Then come up with an alternative. \n An Ceann Comhairle  Sorry, there is a structure on this debate. \n The Taoiseach  What I am always amused by----- \n Deputy Peadar Tóibín  We are just giving suggestions. \n An Ceann Comhairle  It is not allowed. \n The Taoiseach  Fianna Fáil as a party has committed to the North with great substance over the years - Charles Haughey, Albert Reynolds and Bertie Ahern in terms of the Good Friday Agreement. In this Government and the last, we did something that has never been done in the shared island initiative. Some €1 billion from 2020 to 2025 and beyond and another €1 billion in this programme for Government, which is bringing real substance. Instead of all the rhetoric and everything else, we are doing things. Part of that has also been a very important investment in real research into the different systems North and South - into our health systems, into education completion, into energy, into enterprise, and into ecology and climate. Good stuff has been done by the Economic and Social Research Institute. I defy the Deputies to go back over the last 100 years and come up with anything that parallels the level of research we have undertaken to try to understand better the different systems and different approaches.  Now, I will put a challenge to Sinn Féin. It has been talking about this for decades but it has not produced a scrap of paper in terms of----- \n Deputy Ruairí Ó Murchú  That is not true. \n Deputy Rose Conway-Walsh  That is not true. \n The Taoiseach  One second, please. I am just trying to make a point. \n Deputy Rose Conway-Walsh  Yes, but it is not the truth. \n An Ceann Comhairle  It is not a back and forth. \n Deputy Rose Conway-Walsh  Do not tell untruths. \n The Taoiseach  In terms of a blueprint, why is Sinn Féin afraid to bring forward a blueprint? \n Deputy Rose Conway-Walsh  You are the Taoiseach. \n An Ceann Comhairle  There are seven other Deputies, Taoiseach. \n Deputy Rose Conway-Walsh  You are the leader. \n The Taoiseach  I know. \n An Ceann Comhairle  It is not a back and forth. \n The Taoiseach  We are taking our responses in terms of the Good Friday Agreement. \n Deputy Conor D. McGuinness  You lead the Government. \n The Taoiseach  I believe in the unity of the Irish people, okay,----- \n An Ceann Comhairle  Seven other Deputies, Taoiseach. \n The Taoiseach  -----but I would say to the Deputies that with everything Sinn Féin does, the onus is on the Government. The Government will take its responsibilities in relation to this but----- \n Deputy David Cullinane  I have brought forward a plan for healthcare. I will send it on to you. \n The Taoiseach  -----fo a party I would have thought was so committed as Sinn Féin is rhetorically - it keeps going on about it - it has produced very little in terms of what it believes the blueprint should be. \n Deputy Rose Conway-Walsh  We have done several studies. \n An Ceann Comhairle  Just to remind----- \n The Taoiseach  That is the point I would make----- \n Deputy Ruairí Ó Murchú  And we have engaged. \n The Taoiseach  -----because the party always wants us to produce the blueprint. \n Deputy Ruairí Ó Murchú  That is because we are not in power. \n The Taoiseach  By the way, Fianna Fáil will not be found wanting, nor will other parties, in terms of delivering substance in respect of this issue. \n Deputy Ruairí Ó Murchú  You are the Government. \n An Ceann Comhairle  Taoiseach, just to remind you there are seven other Deputies. \n The Taoiseach  That is covering all the seven really. There are a good few----- \n Deputy Peadar Tóibín  But it is not getting us anywhere. \n An Ceann Comhairle  No, the next seven, including Deputy Boyd Barrett. \n The Taoiseach  Deputy Devlin made a very important point and he has done very good work as Chair of the Good Friday committee. I certainly think he is correct in respect of what has happened in Nigeria. At the European Union-African Union Summit, that was raised in terms of what Boko Haram and various jihadist groups were doing in terms of the persecution and killing of many people, but Christians as well, and the kidnapping of young girls and so on. I appreciate the point the Deputy raised there.  To Deputy Boyd Barrett on the issues around Palestine Action, all of our embassies and so on provide whatever consular supports to any Irish citizen who is on remand or in prison. We always provide whatever supports we can or whatever assistance but we do not and obviously cannot interfere in the criminal justice system. I will review the case of Jordan Devlin and I will ask again our ambassador in London for an update in respect of that. \n Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett  You should speak out against Starmer's policy. \n An Ceann Comhairle  Please, Deputy. \n Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett  It is a disgraceful policy. \n The Taoiseach  I have no issue with people - obviously, I do not - supporting Palestinians. I do have an issue - I am not saying this happened in these cases at all because I do not know the full detail of them - but I read recently of a case where there was a ramming of building in London, so it is not as black and white as the Deputy has articulated, or even here where people drive through gates and barriers and do criminal damage. TDs' offices have had criminal damage by, I would say, more extreme elements of people who were involved in supporting the Palestinian movement, unfortunately. It is true. My own office was damaged three times. I know other TDs whose offices were damaged. \n Deputy Erin McGreehan  Hear, hear. \n The Taoiseach  So, is that acceptable? Is that legitimate protest? No, it is not. When there are people working in those offices, they do not think it is legitimate. All I am saying is we all have to be clear on the demarcation line. I am not familiar with the individual cases here in terms of the alleged crimes and so on like that, but let us not try to pretend that everything is just all one way because----- \n Deputy Paul Murphy  But in Britain, if you just hold a sign saying \"Free Palestine Action\", you can be arrested. \n An Ceann Comhairle  Please, Deputy Murphy. \n The Taoiseach  -----one thing I do know----- \n Deputy Paul Murphy  That is crazy. \n An Ceann Comhairle  This is orchestrated. I ask you to stop interrupting. \n The Taoiseach  One thing I do know is either on the far right or the far left, people do transgress the lines and let us not pretend they do not. They have in this country in the past. There clearly are other issues in the UK----- \n Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett  I think you will find the Israelis are the transgressors. \n The Taoiseach  -----and so on like that. Look, some people were trying to stop Dublin Port the other day. \n Deputy Paul Murphy  And they got bashed, did they not? \n An Ceann Comhairle  Taoiseach, I do not know if you intend to take any other questions. \n Deputy Paul Murphy  They got battered by gardaí, did they not? \n The Taoiseach  Well, they should not be trying to stop----- \n Deputy Paul Murphy  Did the Taoiseach support the gardaí battering them? \n The Taoiseach  Some 80% of trade in this country goes through Dublin Port and you guys want to wreck it. That is bread on the table. Workers all over the country depend on trade going through Dublin Port. As far as the Deputies are concerned, that should be stopped in its tracks. There are demarcation lines that we have to be very clear about. The right to protest----- \n Deputy Paul Murphy  They were protesting trade with Israel. \n The Taoiseach  -----is a sacred right in this country. We should cherish that and we should never do anything to damage it, nor should others.  I think I have dealt with the issue Deputy Bacik raised in my general response. I do not believe a citizens' assembly is the right way to go.  Deputy Conway-Walsh spoke about the cancer consortium. I helped to set that up originally. We are supporting it. On congenital heart disease, there was a very good agreement and there are cross-Border health initiatives including, for example, an initiative to treat children's hearts in Crumlin. There is more we can do. There is a cancer centre at Altnagelvin. I do not know if the Deputy has seen that. The Republic provided a lot of funding for that. There are also other services. I am all for that. We are researching whether we can provide better primary care services North and South and whether hospital resources can be combined. Deputy McGreehan made a point to me about two hospitals, one of which was Daisy Hill Hospital, where more stuff could be done. We have been working on that through various initiatives. I am all for that. We will continue to do that in conjunction with the ESRI and NESC.  I have given my views on the issue raised by Deputy Eoin Hayes. We have established all-island forums through the shared island initiative. Through that initiative, we have created a climate and biodiversity network, an all-island women's forum and an all-island youth forum where young people get together and talk about the future and about their lives. We have also developed the first all-island music archive, combining music from different traditions in the one archive. That is being funded through the shared island unit. There is a lot happening on the ground. People are just getting together. I was at an event two weeks ago. It was fantastic. People from east Belfast were doing tapestries with people from Inishbofin. Some of them had never been in the Republic before. Some of those from the South had never been in the North. We have a long way to go but we need to do this right and properly.  To respond to Deputy Conor McGuinness, is maith an rud é go bhfuil an coimisinéir teanga nua ann sa Tuaisceart. Tá Acht ann anois. Tá reachtaíocht curtha i láthair. Is dócha go bhfuil an-chuid oibre le déanamh ag an gcoimisinéir chun é sin a chur i bhfeidhm. Níl an reachtaíocht sin lán-cosúil leis an reachtaíocht atá againn anseo. Más féidir linn aon tacaíocht a thabhairt dó agus do ghluaiseacht na Gaeilge sa Tuaisceart, beimid sásta é sin a dhéanamh. Tá a lán déanta againn ach táimid sásta i bhfad níos mó a dhéanamh. \n Deputy Peadar Tóibín  Will the Taoiseach address the lopsided protections for veterans? \n The Taoiseach  Again, they were not negotiated by this Government, nor are they part of the joint framework. It is our understanding that the accommodation made for witnesses should apply in the cases of all victims equally, regardless of the perspective being brought to the matter. \n Deputy Peadar Tóibín  It is a problem then. \n An Ceann Comhairle  The Taoiseach has another 15 minutes. Did he answer Deputy McGuinness's question? \n The Taoiseach  I did. \n An Ceann Comhairle  You did. I am sorry; I was distracted. I would like to welcome a member of the Down's syndrome community, Declan Moran, who is here with Deputy Albert Dolan. You are very welcome, Declan. \n The Taoiseach  You are very welcome, Declan. ",

        "showAs": " 25. Deputy Rose Conway-Walsh asked the Taoiseach if he will report on the programme plan for his Department’s new disability unit for 2025-2027. [65415/25] ",
        "answerText": " An Ceann Comhairle  We have 15 to 16 minutes left. There are 20 Deputies to speak on the next question. I propose to divide the time remaining after the Taoiseach's opening statement between a number of Deputies. \n The Taoiseach  It is a brilliant statement. \n An Ceann Comhairle  The Taoiseach will have to try to be brief. \n The Taoiseach  I jest. \n Deputy Peadar Tóibín  It is all in the delivery. \n The Taoiseach  I will try to cut it short to allow others to come in. I propose to take Questions Nos. 14 to 35, inclusive, together.  I established the disability unit in the Department to bring about a renewed focus and urgency and out of a desire to drive progress on disability issues. The unit's first programme plan, published in September, outlines how the unit will drive the delivery of the Government's new national disability strategy, working across government to make the ambitions a reality. In particular, the unit will look to drive innovation, to get things done, to bring momentum to policy implementation, to troubleshoot, where appropriate, to improve the delivery of services, and to get strategic thinking on future challenges. The unit will also support the Cabinet committee on disability.  The first programme plan for the unit outlines ten priority areas for the period from 2025 to 2027 across five workstreams. The first workstream relates to transforming children's disability services, early years education and health. The second is about increasing system capacity and the third is about opening doors and addressing barriers to employment pathways and supports. The fourth relates to implementing the national disability strategy and the fifth is on planning and designing for the future. The programme plan allows for further workstreams to be assigned to the unit as may be needed.  We do not want to duplicate the work of Ministers or Departments but to support them in improving services and getting things done. It is already up and running. The Cabinet committee on disability has met five times to date. With the support of the unit, we have looked at the new national disability strategy. As the House will know, that has gone through and has now been published. The provision of therapists in special schools is up and running. Some €16 million has been allocated for that this year. There have also been improvements to the delivery of services and the assessment of need process is being reformed, which includes legislative reform.  The budget was impacted by the unit and the Cabinet subcommittee and there was a significant focus on disability, particularly the income disregards for carer's allowance, among other initiatives and payments. The budget also provided a record €3.8 billion allocation towards specialist disability services. This represents a 20% increase year on year. That is to provide permanent dedicated funding for essential disability services. The investment in children's disability services will provide therapy services and strengthen the children's disability network teams through the provision of additional staff and so forth. Some €20 million was targeted at the assessment of need waitlist initiative, providing up to 6,500 clinical assessments. We are developing our budget spotlight on disability. That will be published in due course. It relates to the last budget but will also provide further thinking with regard to future budgets. We are also looking at developments in the area of transport and mobility. We are awaiting proposals from the Departments of Transport and Finance in that regard. \n An Ceann Comhairle  I propose to take the first six Deputies and to allow the Taoiseach six minutes to respond. \n Deputy Pádraig O'Sullivan  This is a topic the Taoiseach is very familiar with. He has visited the Rainbow Club on dozens of occasions at this stage and knows the great work that Jon, Karen and the board do. When Senator Rabbitte was the Minister of State, she was the first to allocate funding to the Rainbow Club under a service level agreement to provide respite care for children. As the Taoiseach will know, every week, over 1,200 children avail of this service, which is provided on a shoestring budget. The Taoiseach will be very familiar with the difficulties the club had in acquiring a nearby site, the former HSE ambulance building. It now has that building and has been lucky enough to engage an architect who is a professional in this field pro bono to design a bespoke building that is fit for the club's purposes. We need to move this project on. We need the HSE and the Government to support it financially to deliver it. It is going to be a massive undertaking for the charity. What is the Taoiseach's office going to do to advance the project? \n Deputy Ruairí Ó Murchú  The National Human Rights Strategy for Disabled People 2025-2030 was launched with great fanfare but we await the action plan. There is much talk of accountability. Will the Taoiseach give me a timeline for the introduction of that action plan? Who will be taking the lead, particularly with regard to oversight and accountability? Will it be the unit, the Cabinet committee or the Department of Children, Disability and Equality? How exactly will it work? How will we see improvements, whether in relation to assessments and therapies or the low level of disabled people who are involved in employment and the need for schemes that actually work? A lot of work is needed to make schemes such as the wage subsidy scheme and the work and access programme fit for purpose. \n Deputy Cian O'Callaghan  The level of unemployment among disabled people in Ireland is among the worst in Europe. I recently met with a number of disabled people in my constituency who have excellent qualifications and skills and who are willing and eager to work but who are stuck in unemployment. There are a number of barriers to employment that need to be removed. We are far behind other European countries in this regard. In 2021, the OECD released a report that made a number of recommendations as to how to tackle this. Those recommendations have still not been implemented. When will they be implemented in full?  What is the Government doing to tackle the scandalously high unemployment levels for disabled people in Ireland? \n Deputy Barry Heneghan  Bhí mé ag caint faoi seo dhá sheachtain ó shin agus an tseachtain seo caite. An rud atá i gceist ná Stapolin Educate Together National School in Baldoyle, which has a petition. Children from the school were in the Dáil last week. It needs two autism classrooms to be sanctioned by the Minister. There are eight children in mainstream classes with eligibility letters and a further 30 in the catchment area who are on waiting lists. This is a huge priority for me and I would love it to be addressed. \n Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett  David and Nicole have a five-year-old son with autism, and an older son. They live in a maisonette, which is 29 sq. m. It is absolutely tiny and rank with damp. Because of his autism, their son has serious sensory processing issues. He is a flight risk. I know these flats well. They have very dangerous concrete steps, which are a serious risk to him. Occupational therapists, medical professionals and people in school have said that he has to be got out of there as he cannot develop or do his occupational therapy if he is living in these conditions. Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council says autism is too prevalent in the community to give it medical priority. That is outrageous. The prevalence of a condition is not a reason to say it is not a priority if the child is in danger. If a child is in danger, it is a priority to get the child out of danger. \n An Ceann Comhairle  I appreciate that. The Taoiseach has the message. \n Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett  I would like there to be an intervention on that. \n Deputy Paul Murphy  The budget was a savage attack on disabled people. It took over €1,000 out of the pockets of disabled people and betrayed the promise in the programme for Government to introduce a permanent annual cost-of-disability support payment. The last time I asked about this, the Taoiseach claimed the cost of disability would be looked at in the next budget. The cost-of-living crisis is now. The cost-of-disability crisis is now. Some 70,000 people who are disabled or have a long-term illness are living in poverty. That is one in three. I have been inundated with emails from disabled people asking for winter cost-of-living and cost-of-disability payment. Many will be forced to choose between heating and eating this Christmas. They also want a permanent cost-of-disability payment without further delay. The Taoiseach has billions of euro in surplus. Do not be a Scrooge this Christmas. Please act on it. \n Deputy Peadar Tóibín  The children's disability network team, CDNT, in Meath is not fully staffed. According to statistics I received today, there are 20 vacant posts across disability teams in Kells, Dunshaughlin, Navan, Slane and Trim. Separate data received by Aontú today show that the Government is actually reducing the number of college places for speech and language therapists, from 370 in the year before Covid to 355 last year. The Government is reducing the number of students filling the necessary college places on an annual basis. What is the Taoiseach saying to parents whose children have been waiting for 14 months to see the CDNT in County Meath and to the children who are being bounced around endlessly from CAMHS, the CDNTs and other services? \n An Ceann Comhairle  Before the Taoiseach replies, could he maybe answer the other Deputies in writing?  Sixteen Deputies did not get to ask questions. They might get some form of response from the Taoiseach. \n The Taoiseach  You can bring some more of them in if you want, a Cheann Comhairle. \n An Ceann Comhairle  Only if the Taoiseach needs less time. We cannot go over the 45 minutes provided. \n The Taoiseach  I am not going to write replies to oral questions. I have given an overall response to everybody. \n An Ceann Comhairle  I am bound by the timelines set down. \n The Taoiseach  Do I have six minutes remaining? \n An Ceann Comhairle  Yes. \n The Taoiseach  I will get around to everybody who has asked a question. \n An Ceann Comhairle  I am talking about the Deputies who have not have not got in. \n Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett  The Taoiseach cannot really answer questions that have not been asked. \n An Ceann Comhairle  I know, but that is it. \n The Taoiseach  It is a new departure if I am going to do a written reply to every oral question. That is not on either. \n An Ceann Comhairle  The Taoiseach should go ahead. I suppose it is just a casualty of how interruptions affect the course of questions. To be fair, the Taoiseach cannot answer a question that has not been asked. We are delaying the answering process. \n Deputy Jennifer Whitmore  Could we even have 30 seconds to ask a question and then maybe the Taoiseach could respond? \n An Ceann Comhairle  No. We cannot go over time. I do not set the time. I do not have that discretion. \n Deputy Jennifer Whitmore  No, but we could stay within the time. \n An Ceann Comhairle  There are 15 Deputies left. \n The Taoiseach  Deputy Pádraig O'Sullivan raised the Rainbow Club, which is doing exceptional work. Jon and Karen O'Mahony have been exceptional leaders in that regard. The former Minister of State, now Senator Rabbitte, did good work on a service level agreement. I was involved in advocating for that building, which was a HSE building, to be allocated to the Rainbow Club. I will certainly continue to work with them and to support them with capital. What is important is that we get a timeline and some idea of how we can progress that as quickly as we possibly can. It is a very good, practical example of how a parent-led, community-based approach can develop services for autism in a nimble and flexible way that has helped so many families.  Deputy Ó Murchú asked about the action plan. That will come.  I do not have an exact date but it is on target. It is fairly imminent. \n Deputy Ruairí Ó Murchú  Who will lead on it? \n An Ceann Comhairle  Please, Deputy Ó Murchú. \n The Taoiseach  The Minister, Deputy Foley, will lead, with the support of the unit in my office, but she will also report to the Cabinet subcommittee, which will then make recommendations to the Cabinet. That is how this will work. The Cabinet subcommittee is very important because all the key Ministers have to be there.  I agree with Deputy Cian O'Callaghan that the unemployment levels among the disability community is too high, and the barriers are too much. Part of the strategy in terms of what I am trying to do with the Minister, Deputy Calleary, is to remove some of those barriers and to create additional supports to make sure that employers are even more incentivised to recruit people. The intention is also to give supports to those who employ people with disabilities on a more sustainable basis. I do not disagree with the Deputy. The historic underemployment of people with disabilities in society is something that is exercising me.  I will pursue the issue raised by Deputy Heneghan about the two autism classes in the Educate Together school in Baldoyle.  I agree with Deputy Boyd Barrett. That is a very strange response from the council referring to the prevalence of autism. Autism is a spectrum, a continuum. There is high-functioning autism, people in the middle and those with autism which is very severe and profound. The council should be able to use the general guidelines in respect of health needs more generally. I am at a loss as to why the council cannot say in this case that the child needs prioritisation and a proper house to facilitate the treatment and life of the child. That is something on which I will go back to the Minister for housing in respect of guidelines to be sent to councils in that respect. I would not have thought it necessary. I thought councils would have enough flexibility to do this.  I disagree with Deputy Paul Murphy's description of the budget as a savage attack, but €3 billion has been invested in special education as an outcome of the budget, as well as €130 million for grants to adapt the houses of older people and disabled people. There was a €10 increase per week in the disability allowance, an expansion of the wage subsidy scheme, an increase of €375 in the income limit for carer's benefit, and a €20 increase in the monthly domiciliary care allowance. That is not a savage attack on disability. We have to pursue the cost of disability and the Minister will bring plans in the next budget in respect of that.  In response to Deputy Tóibín, the vacancy rate nationally has come down for CDNTs. We have increased the allocation of therapy places in third level colleges. \n An Ceann Comhairle  I thank the Taoiseach. Even though there is time left, the point is that this format is not working. The place to discuss that is at the Business Committee on Thursday. I ask Members to bring it up and we can sort out something else. Certainly, where there is a grouping of 19 Members, it is not possible to give the Taoiseach time to answer in the remaining time. I am sorry for those who did not get in but there is just nothing we can do, other than discuss it at the Business Committee and change the format. ",

        "answerText": " Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage  Delivering Homes, Building Communities, published 13 November 2025, recognises that homelessness is the single most pressing social issue and introduces a number of key measures to address homelessness.  Prevention of homelessness in the first instance is an absolute priority. There are many preventions initiatives already underway in my own Department and across Government. This includes the provision of social and affordable housing, the Housing Assistance Payment (HAP) and homeless HAP, and strong tenancy protection legislation. My Department is committed to developing a national Homelessness Prevention Framework within which homelessness can be prevented in a structured and planned way with tailored prevention measures for each potential at risk cohort. This Framework will be in place in 2026.  In Delivering Homes, Building Communities, the Government, has reaffirmed its commitment to maintaining the Second Hand Social Housing Acquisitions Programme. The priority aim of the programme will continue to be supporting individuals and families in the most challenging and precarious of housing situations, with a particular focus on exiting individuals and families from long-term homeless accommodation. This priority category of the Second Hand Social Housing Acquisitions Programme also primarily supports the CAS-funded acquisitions for disability-related situations undertaken by AHBs with local authority support. With regard to tenancy sustainment (tenant-in-situ), the Second Hand Social Housing Acquisitions Programme will continue to support this priority category, as a necessary last resort policy tool, available to local authorities to help prevent individuals or families falling into homelessness.  My Department jointly published the National Housing Strategy for Disabled People (NHSDP) 2022-2027 and Implementation Plan with the Department of Health and the Department of Children, Disability, and Equality. The Strategy and Implementation Plan may be accessed on my Department’s website at the following link: www.gov.ie/en/publication/60d76-national-housing-strategy-for-disabled-people-2022-2027/ The Strategy and Implementation Plan sets out the actions to achieve the vision of the joint Strategy for delivering housing and related supports for disabled people to 2027, operating under the new housing plan Delivering Homes, Building Communities.

        "answerText": " Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage  I propose to take Questions Nos. 24, 62, 118, 133 and 547 together.  Tackling vacancy and dereliction is at the heart of the Government's housing plan Delivering Homes, Building Communities 2025-2030.  The Vacant Property Refurbishment Grant introduced in July 2022, provides a grant of up to €50,000 for the refurbishment of vacant properties for occupation as a principal private residence and for properties which will be made available for rent. A top-up grant of up to €20,000 is available where the property is confirmed to be derelict, bringing the total grant available for a derelict property up to a maximum of €70,000.  The grant process involves the local authority receiving and reviewing applications to ensure that the grant conditions are met and arranging for a qualified person to visit the property to check the refurbishment work being applied for and to assess the proposed cost. Following confirmation of a successful application and the works being completed, the local authority will conduct a final property visit to review that the work has been completed in-line with the grant application. Once the local authority is satisfied, they will then pay the grant.  Payment of the grant at the end of the process is to ensure that the applicant has carried out the works applied for and for which the grant is being paid. This is also the case for grants such as the SEAI grants and Housing Adaptation Grants, which are paid when works are completed.  A review of the Vacant Property Refurbishment Grant, including the matter of staged payments, was undertaken in 2024. That review has been completed and is under consideration.  Under the Local Authority Purchase and Renovation Loan, launched in July 2024, a first-time buyer who wishes to purchase and/or renovate a Vacant Property Refurbishment Grant eligible home but who cannot get sufficient funding from commercial lenders is now able to apply to their local authority for a loan under the scheme. The Local Authority Purchase and Renovation Loan has the potential to help first time buyers and fresh start applicants to complete the purchase and renovation of a vacant or derelict property and provides an avenue to secure the necessary finance to make the project viable.  The new housing plan reinforces and expands the range of existing measures being implemented by Government to tackle the issue of vacancy and dereliction. The plan includes an action to provide additional support under the Vacant Property Refurbishment Grant for the refurbishment and conversion of above the shop vacant floors for use as homes. In recognition of the works involved, it is proposed that a package of up to €140,000 will be made available. The Department is currently progressing work to introduce the expanded and extended “Above the Shop scheme”.  S.I. No. 75/2022 - Planning and Development Act (Exempted Development) Regulations 2022 provides an exemption from the requirement for planning permission for the conversion of certain types of vacant commercial property into residential use, up to a maximum of 9 residential units and subject to specified conditions. The Regulations, which were extended in 2022 under SI 75/2022 to include an exemption for the conversion of vacant pubs, have now been further extended to the end of 2028. Accordingly, any specific works proposed in a conversion project would need to be examined in the context of fulfilling the requirements of these Regulations, to determine if planning permission is required.  My Department publishes data on applications for the Vacant Property Refurbishment Grant on its website on a quarterly basis, which includes the number of applications, approvals and the total number and value of grants paid per local authority. This data also includes a breakdown of applications for the Vacant Property Refurbishment Grant and the Derelict Property Top-up Grant for every quarter. The Q3 2025 grant statistics were published on 17 October 2025. This data can be accessed at the following link: www.gov.ie/en/department-of-housing-local-government-and-heritage/collections/vacant-property-refurbishment-grant-statistics/#2025 ",

        "answerText": " The Taoiseach  I propose to take Questions Nos. 1 to 16, inclusive, together.  The Cabinet Committee on water quality oversees implementation of the programme for Government commitments in relation to the range of issues affecting Ireland’s water system. The committee last met on 30 October and the date of its next meeting has not yet been scheduled. The committee is informed by the work of the Environmental Protection Agency, EPA, which monitors and reports on water quality in Ireland. The EPA recently published its report Water Quality in Ireland 2019-2024, which shows water quality improvements in some areas but also an overall decline in waterbodies in a satisfactory ecological condition. While the overall ecological status of Ireland’s waters is significantly better than the European Union average, the downward trend is a matter of concern. The report shows that targeted actions in the agricultural sector and improvements in wastewater treatment appear to be paying dividends, with lower reported levels of nutrients in water bodies where targeted actions have been taken.  The Cabinet committee has also examined the investment programme of Uisce Éireann to improve wastewater treatment capacity and meet best practice in managing its existing infrastructure. Last week, the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage published a sectoral plan for water services and water quality. This includes record investment of €12.2 billion, largely allocated to Uisce Éireann to support the delivery of the additional water services capacity required to deliver the Government's housing plan and to improve water quality. This investment will help to deliver the Government water action plan, Ireland's roadmap to protect and restore our rivers, lakes, estuaries, coastal waters and ground waters.  Last year, the Government also published Water and Agriculture: A Collaborative Approach, and this report sets out measures to address the twin objectives of improving water quality and demonstrating that a robust case exists for the maintenance of a derogation for Ireland from certain aspects of the EU nitrates directive. In October, the Minister, Deputy Browne, published a draft nitrates action programme, which will form the basis of Ireland’s ongoing discussions with the European Commission on a new derogation. The Minister has invited submissions from the public on its contents. A public consultation process on the strategic environmental assessment and appropriate assessment of the plan is also live, with submissions invited by 1 December.  European Union environmental Commissioner Roswall visited Ireland last week and met with the Minister, Deputy Heydon, as well as farmers and other stakeholders to discuss Ireland's application for a derogation and the importance of its continuation to Ireland's outdoor, grass-based livestock systems. The visit provided an opportunity for the Commissioner to visit a farm in County Kildare to see at first hand the efforts towards improving water quality and to engage with public representatives and stakeholders. Discussions with the Commission are ongoing to find an approach that facilitates the continuation of high-quality dairy and beef production by derogation farmers while ensuring sufficient protection for the quality and ecological status of our rivers, lakes and estuaries. \n An Ceann Comhairle  We have 16 speakers. They have a minute each and I ask them to be as concise as possible. I call on Deputy Cleere. \n Deputy Peter 'Chap' Cleere  Last week, we saw serious disruption for towns and villages like Thomastown, Graiguenamanagh, Inistioge and Freshford, which are currently faced with significant backlogs for the implementation of effective flood relief schemes. I acknowledge there has been extensive consultations with local communities to achieve a solution that satisfies those communities and the needs of the local environment. However, the delivery has been delayed far too long. The conversation needs to move to action. It is all about implementation and delivering effective solutions for these communities at risk.  Let me give the Taoiseach a brief example. In Graiguenamanagh, my own town, there was a major flood issue in 2016. In 2018, funding was announced. In 2020, a design team was assigned. We are now in November 2025, and we have not even gone for planning permission yet. It is anticipated that the planning process will take two years. Construction will then start at the end of 2028, with a two-year timeframe for completion. That just gives an example of the length of time these projects are taking. \n An Ceann Comhairle  The Deputy has five seconds. \n Deputy Peter 'Chap' Cleere  I understand that fish life is important, but what about the lives of Johnny and Mary, living in a house that has been flooded? The people in Freshford, Graiguenamanagh, Thomastown and Inistioge are going to bed at night from November to March wondering if their houses will be flooded come the morning. \n An Ceann Comhairle  I thank the Deputy. \n Deputy Peter 'Chap' Cleere  The injustice to these communities has gone on far too long. \n Deputy Aindrias Moynihan  Farmers are very keen to improve water quality. The recent oversubscription of environmental schemes reflects that appetite. Our grass-based system differs very much from what would be found across Europe. Family farms right across Ireland need to be able to plan for the year ahead and the nitrates derogation is very much part of the planning for the day-to-day operation of the farms. Farmers are really keen to know where they stand and they are going to need to know that for the start of the year. Retaining this derogation is vital. I very much impressed this on Commissioner Roswall during her recent visit to Ireland. She did acknowledge that progress had been made but she was also keen to see that there would be ongoing progress and improvements. Will the Minister and the Government be able to win support across EU colleagues to ensure the derogation will be retained? Additionally, farmers are also being told they are not alone in respect of improving water quality. They are keen to pull their weight and they will, but they also need to know that municipal waste inputs and Irish Water will also pull their weight. \n Deputy Paul Murphy  Two years ago, I raised with the Taoiseach a repeated problem of sewage overflowing in Dodder Valley Park beside Balrothery weir. When there is heavy rainfall, the sewage shoots out beside a residential area in a beautiful park. It is still happening. It happened again last weekend with the heavy rainfall. In March 2024, I got a reply from Uisce Éireann accepting that it was impacting the environment and posing a risk to public health through flooding. At that time, it said it was at stage 3 of a four-stage process and it would have options and costings in quarter 4 of 2024. In August 2024, I followed up on this matter. I got a response in February of this year, over six months after the promised commencement of stage 4. The company apologised for the delay and said it was concluding stage 3 and moving into stage 4. I have followed up again with the company. It is simply unacceptable that the health of residents and park users is put at risk and that the deadlines for action keep getting delayed. Does the Taoiseach agree that Irish Water, Uisce Éireann, must act? \n Deputy Ruairí Ó Murchú  I would like to use this time to remember Chloe McGee, Chloe Hipson, Dylan Commins, Shay Duffy and Alan McCluskey. Ar dheis Dé go raibh a n-anamacha dílse. We think of their families and friends. It is going to be a very difficult time over the next couple of days for communities right across counties Louth, Monaghan and Meath. I have been in O'Fiaich College and DkIT and seen huge supports for students and staff. It was the same in the Sean McDermotts club last night also. This is the level of resilience we will see. My thoughts go out to those affected by what has been an absolutely desperate tragedy. I also think of those injured. We hope for a speedy recovery. Beyond that, we think of the emergency services, whose members saw things nobody should have to see. \n An Ceann Comhairle  Go raibh maith agat. I appreciate that yesterday's proceedings overtook us and we did not get to pay our due respects. What the Deputy said goes for us all. I thank him. I call on Deputy Conor D. McGuinness. \n Deputy Conor D. McGuinness  Go raibh maith agat. I want to raise with the Taoiseach the situation of two households living in Lyre, Mahon Bridge, County Waterford. They live in two adjoining council-built cottages constructed in 1949. At the time, the local authority installed a water supply from an open stream flowing off the Comeragh Mountains, and that is still their only source of water 75 years later. It is untreated and coming from a roadside stream. The water runs black and is full of silt, filth and worse. Each of the men has pulled dead rats and badgers from it on occasion. The supply is so unsafe that the health authorities have warned them not to even wash their hands with it.  I have raised this directly with the Minister for housing and with Uisce Éireann. A brand new public mains runs just 500 m from the townland of Fews across from these men's homes. Connecting these homes would require just a short bore under a regional road but Uisce Éireann has refused to fund it and instead told residents to apply for a private well grant. Unfortunately, the land in the area they live in is not suitable for a private well and they have that on good authority from several professional well drillers. Will the Taoiseach please act in the interests of these two households and instruct Uisce Éireann? I will show the Taoiseach, very briefly, a bottle with a sample of water they provided me with recently. It illustrates the depth of what their public water supply is. \n An Ceann Comhairle  Deputy, we do not allow displays of such nature but I understand it is your first time. I call Deputy Barry Heneghan. \n Deputy Barry Heneghan  I have raised the issue of water quality in Dublin Bay time and time again. I am not going to just single out the north side. This is a north and south Dublin problem. We saw the rain that fell at the weekend. We have all seen the drone footage of the bay being polluted. I have swimmers whose only way of socialising is getting into that water and having the chats but the E. coli levels are not acceptable at the moment. In Dublin Bay and with the way the plumes work with the tides, the north side is affected worse when there is a high level. Some of these constituents are here today with the visual artists from Palestine who raised money for Artists Without Borders in Clontarf Castle. They are going to be swimming in that water. These are the people who need this water protected. We see in Dún Laoghaire that oysters are being brought in to treat the water. Can we get that on the north side as well? I have a mandate for that. It was on my four-pager. Oysters are great natural filters of E. coli and other contaminants. \n Deputy Rose Conway-Walsh  The EU drinking water regulations came into effect in Irish law in March 2023. \n The Taoiseach  Sorry, the which? \n Deputy Rose Conway-Walsh  The EU drinking water regulations. I raise it in the context of the ongoing intolerable situation where 500 households in Ballycroy and Inishbiggle, in County Mayo are left without water for days on end. The way to solve this is to allow some flexibility in the multi-annual water programme to enable moneys that have been returned to the Department, or are to be returned to the Department, from one scheme can be reallocated to another scheme that desperately needs it. There is a gravity-fed group scheme in Ballycroy and it is run by volunteers. What has happened is some of the volunteers have passed away so they are trying to reconfigure the volunteers in the parish to be able to apply for the necessary funding. There is a way to solve this. Mayo County Council applied for emergency funding earlier this year but was unsuccessful so we need emergency funding and some flexibility around the framework. \n Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett  I also wish to raise the issue of water quality in Dublin Bay, for the umpteenth time. Every time there is a massive downpour like the ones we had very recently, rainfall water or stormwater mixes with sewage and pours into Dublin Bay. The pumping station at the west pier in Dún Laoghaire pumps stuff out to Ringsend but Ringsend does not have the capacity. It overflows, goes into Dublin Bay and then water quality is very seriously undermined.  I was looking at a question I asked back in 2019, and it was not the first time. Even then, the Government was promising it was going to upgrade Ringsend. That was 2019 and it still has not been done. It still happens every time it rains. It is unbelievable. When is the Government finally going to make sure that the upgrade at Ringsend and the rehabilitation of our decrepit water infrastructure, which is jeopardising water quality, swimmers and health and causing all sorts of bad, adverse problems, is going to be finally addressed by this Government? \n Deputy Liam Quaide  I know the Taoiseach will reject the claim that rural Ireland is being left behind by his Government but many residents of the village of Ballyhooly in my constituency beg to differ. They have good reason to. The very basic need for a consistent supply of water to drink, bathe in or use in appliances such as dishwashers and showers has been denied to them for many years. Residents in Ballyhooly have to deal with extremely low water pressure alternating with a non-existent supply of water for prolonged periods. This has hit people with chronic illness, disability and age-related care needs the hardest. It has also severely impacted the local school and farming community. In recent months, there has been a reprieve from a full-scale outage but water pressure remains very low and there is no clear timeframe on the extent of works required to resolve the issue. Short-term fixes will no longer cut it for Ballyhooly. When are we going to see movement on this essential project that will allow the village to thrive? \n Deputy Erin McGreehan  Along with my constituency colleague, I want to pay respects to those poor five souls, the young people who lost their lives in the car accident at the weekend: Chloe McGee, Shay Duffy, Alan McCluskey, Dylan Commins and Chloe Hipson. It is a desperate loss for their families, friends, work colleagues and everybody. I only hope their families can find the strength to walk along the pain and agony that comes upon a family when they lose someone so tragically. It seems almost futile and frivolous to mention it during a discussion on water quality.  I have raised on several occasions the state of the water and rivers around Dundalk Bay. Research was published recently in a local newsletter spelling out clearly issues around repeated sewage discharge and wastewater plants operating beyond capacity, with visible waste near Blackrock and protected habitats being steadily damaged. People are seeing it, smelling it and living beside it. As the Taoiseach knows, I raise these concerns regularly and I get very dismissive responses from Irish Water. I often feel almost gaslit by them. I hope that when the Cabinet committee is working on water quality with the infrastructure Department that it will consider fast-tracking projects to make sure our water quality is up to standard. \n Deputy Peadar Tóibín  Keeping the lights and on and water in the taps is surely one of the basic responsibilities of any administration but we live in a country where that is simply not happening. For a country where it seldom stops raining, it hardly goes a week before there is a water or hosepipe ban in this country. In my county of Meath, things are out of control currently. As we speak, a burst mains causing major disruption in Navan. There are multiple outages every week in the system in Enfield. People in Trim can hardly turn the water taps on because of discoloured water or bans on water being used at certain times of the day, etc. Councillor Dave Boyne and I have had to campaign to get water trucks to bring water to other towns in the county. The Taoiseach talks about massive investment, which is welcome, but it is not making a difference on the ground because there are major problems for Irish Water to deliver on infrastructure in terms of planning, permits and tendering etc. When will those be fixed so we can get the system fixed? \n Deputy Paul Lawless  I have raised this many times previously but the water quality in Clew Bay, County Mayo is being massively damaged at the moment. Raw sewage from Newport town is collected and stored in containers. When the high tide comes in to Clew Bay, it washes raw sewage on to the shoreline. Everyone is in agreement that a water treatment plant is needed for the town and it has been in the planning process for decades. There are significant issues in relation to the Maritime Area Regulatory Authority, MARA, which is not meeting its statutory timelines, and indeed Uisce Éireann. It appears that what is happening is a letter-writing club between the two organisations, with no progress being made. I have raised this previously and I ask the Taoiseach to intervene. We cannot have critical infrastructure delayed for decades as a result. I have raised this with Uisce Éireann and MARA but it is time the Government intervened and injected some urgency into this. \n The Taoiseach  I thank all of the Deputies. A comprehensive number spoke in respect of the responsibilities of Irish Water, particularly in terms of wastewater treatment plants and flood relief schemes.  Deputy 'Chap' Cleere raised the issue of a series of flood relief schemes in his constituency. I do not know why the planning process should take two years and that is something we need to analyse further but measures will come to Government in respect of critical infrastructure in the next number of weeks. Flood relief schemes are taking too long because the urgency is very real.  Given the worsening climate, we have more frequent storms and rainfall that is heavier and comes in short bursts and that is creating huge pressure on our systems. I have been to many flooding scenes where the devastation is appalling and negatively impacts on households and businesses. We then have consequential compensation schemes and everything we try to do to alleviate the pressure but there is nothing worse than being the victim of a flooding incident. I will take a look at those schemes and talk to the Minister of State with responsibility for the OPW, Deputy Moran, to see how we can accelerate this. We are also looking at a critical infrastructure Bill and will see whether we can include wastewater and flood relief schemes.  Deputy Aindrias Moynihan raised the derogation and I fully agree with him that retaining the derogation is vital for farm families and for the food production system and the dairy industry. We need a sustainable farming industry but farmers are working with us on various water improvement schemes under the European Union framework and have being doing a lot to measure and assess this work. I have had discussions with the President of the European Commission explaining the unique position in Ireland because we have a pasture-based system that is outdoors more than indoors. Most other European systems are indoors. The Minister for agriculture, Deputy Heydon, has been working with Commissioner Roswall, who came to Ireland last week. She met farmers in Kildare and saw first-hand the measures we are taking to make farming and agriculture more sustainable. We know farmers do need to know. I take the Deputy's point in respect of other contributors to waste and I met representatives of Irish Water recently in the context of the Cabinet subcommittee meeting. Representatives from the Environmental Protection Agency were there as well. In my view, Irish Water has to get it right in respect of its own actions. It cannot contribute negatively to water quality, being a water body itself, nor can local authorities. They also certainly need to step up to the plate in protecting our waterways.  Deputy Murphy raised the issue of Balrothery estate in terms of sewerage overflow. Again, I will talk to Irish Water in respect of where that is at. We have allocated unprecedented resources to Irish Water as a result of the national development plan and we have given it multi-annual funding. Irish Water knows what its funding will be for the next five years, which should enable staff to get on, to plan and do things. There is a lot of work to be done. Our population is growing exponentially, and has grown during the past two decades. That is creating pressure on water services. What will be important as well, for those who correctly referenced wastewater treatment plants, is that we have to try to create a narrative and a consensus in society not to object to wastewater treatment plants, to their upgrade or to supply projects. An awful lot of these projects are getting snarled up in planning and being delayed for far too long. What is happening in the preparation of the schemes, stage III to stage IV, is that everybody is dotting the i's and crossing the t's because they are anticipating an objection or a judicial review so they want to make sure they can be resilient in the face of a court case being heard or a judicial review of a decision taken during the planning process. What we are getting is a very slow process in getting projects through. We will have to deal with that and the Government is determined to deal with that because we have to push ahead. Even on a small issue like apartment guidelines, and we had it earlier this afternoon during Leaders' Questions, we get public representatives judicially reviewing regulation. Then people complain about things not moving. We cannot have it our own way, every way, but that is a general comment on where we are and it is important.  Deputies Ó Murchú and McGreehan correctly articulated all of our shock and horror at the devastating accident in Louth. Five young lives were lost. They were going out for a nice evening. We are all parents and we are all afraid of something like that happening when our young people go out and so on and we all want them to come home. On this occasion, they did not come home and the impacts on the parents are beyond comprehension. It is very difficult for them. We hope the beautiful memories they had with their young children will sustain them in the time ahead. I thank the Deputies for raising this in the House.  In regard to Deputy McGuinness's contribution, I will talk to Irish Water. I cannot get involved in every single case. This relates to two houses. Surely the county council and Irish Water should knock heads together and get that issue sorted if the water mains are 500 m away.  Deputy Heneghan has left the Chamber. He has gone with the swimmers; I would say they are gone too. Deputy Boyd Barrett raised the issue of Dublin Bay as well. It is a very serious issue. E.coli levels are too high and when there is heavy rain. people cannot swim. That is not satisfactory. I am back to the issue that we need wastewater treatment plants. The whole Dublin water project is being judicially reviewed. The Arklow wastewater treatment plant was conceived at the same time as the Dublin scheme. It has opened - I opened it - and the Dublin scheme has not even gotten off the ground. There are other projects of that kind we need to get off the ground and to get going. The points were well made by Deputies Boyd Barrett and Heneghan in that regard.  In terms of the drinking water regulation and the 500 households, again it is a specific issue and I will talk to Irish Water in respect of that. \n Deputy Rose Conway-Walsh  That is not Irish Water \n The Taoiseach  Is it a group scheme? \n Deputy Rose Conway-Walsh  It is a group scheme. \n The Taoiseach  The Deputy wants flexibility in the multi-annual funding. I will talk to the Minister to see whether there is anything that can be done there or not. \n Deputy Rose Conway-Walsh  Thank you. \n The Taoiseach  There is a combination of issues in terms of the reconstitution of the group of volunteers. Deputy Boyd Barrett raised the issue that Ringsend does not have capacity. We have been engaging and have appointed----- \n Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett  It has been going on for years. \n The Taoiseach  I know and we have allocated billions of euro now so hopefully we can get it done.  Deputy Quaide raised the issue of Balyhooly and the basic quality of water. I have spoken to Irish Water representatives about the Cork situation more generally in terms of water quality issues and they are working on that.  Deputy McGreehan again raised the issue of habitats and Dundalk Bay. Again, I asked Irish Water to engage with public representatives. All State agencies should engage with public representatives in a respectful and engaging way and should give proper responses. The State funds these agencies. In many ways they are created as agencies to get things done but that should not absolve the agencies then of their responsibilities to communicate to democratically elected Deputies and Senators or indeed councillors on the local authorities as well. I will have a look at what the story is in Dundalk Bay.  Deputy Tóibín raised the issue of Trim again in terms of keeping the taps on and water quality. Again, it relates to wider issues. They had the plan, we have now funded the plan, and the issue now is getting things done as quickly as we can.  Deputy Lawless raised Clew Bay and Newport. Again, it is about getting the infrastructure in place as quickly as we can. I will relay all of those to Irish Water for a response. \n An Ceann Comhairle  I thank the Taoiseach. We will move to the next questions, which is the grouping of Question Nos. 17 to 31, inclusive, to ask the Taoiseach for a report on the work of the shared island unit. We have 17 minutes and 14 seconds left. ",

The planning, design and construction of National and Regional Greenways is a matter for Transport Infrastructure Ireland (TII) in conjunction with the relevant local authority  To assist in delivery of greenways a Code of Best Practice was produced in 2021 to ensure a transparent and pragmatic approach was in taken in terms of community engagement and land acquisition.  The Code states that when developing greenways  state-owned lands should be considered to the greatest extent possible and in doing so minimise the potential impacts on privately owned land. Where it is not feasible to use state-owned lands or where there is limited state-owned lands, engagement with local landowners should be sustained and frequent.  The importance of regular public consultation is embedded within the Code. Engagement between affected landowners and the project team is a critical step to ensure that severance of farm holdings is avoided where feasible to do so particularly once a preferred route corridor is published. An independent agronomist is also available to assist landowners with their queries provide advice on the impact of the proposals.  The Code does refer to the use of the Compulsory Purchase Order (CPO) as a ‘measure of last resort’ if voluntary land acquisition agreements are not possible after sustained engagement with individual landowners. The CPO is a legal mechanism that is contained within the Planning and Development Act 2000 (Section 213) and the Roads Act 1993 (Section 52) which outlines the statutory options available to local authorities. I would like to reiterate that this mechanism is not the preferred or initial approach in delivering greenways.  I have been advised that the Code will undergo a full review in 2026, and key stakeholders will be engaged in the revision process. ",

It provides a targeted range of supports and is additional to the universal supports provided to all schools, such as free schoolbooks and free hot school meals. Schools also have access other universal supports such as well-being supports for students through the National Educational Psychological Service (NEPS), additional teaching hours under the English as an Additional Language (EAL) scheme and advisory support from the Department’s Inspectorate.   Currently, the DEIS programme supports almost 1,200 primary and post-primary schools, reaching approximately 260,000 students, with an annual investment of over €180 million. Budget 2026 allocates an additional €16 million in 2026, rising to €48 million in 2027, to support the implementation of the new DEIS Strategy and introduce the DEIS Plus scheme, which will commence in 2026.  The new DEIS Strategy will include a focus on developing more innovative approaches to addressing educational disadvantage in all schools, DEIS and non-DEIS, and working towards a more flexible system of support to ensure that schools can receive the right support at the right time. This will involve a more dynamic resource allocation model where levels of resources more accurately follow the levels of need identified by objective data.  The details of the DEIS Strategy are being finalised and will be published before the end of the year. Any future allocation of overall resources will be considered within the context of the new DEIS Strategy and the availability of resources. ",

        "answerText": " Minister for Children, Disability and Equality  The Government recognises the importance of early intervention for children with disabilities. The Programme for Government commits to ensuring that children and their families who need early intervention and therapy input can access that support in a timely way.  Government has made funding available in 2025 to build on existing recruitment initiatives for children’s disability services, focusing on various positions across Children’s Disability Network Teams.  A further €8 million has been secured in Budget 2026 to allow for the recruitment of 150 staff to Children’s Disability Network Teams. Funding will build on progress made in recent years to reduce Children’s Disability Network Team waiting lists.  It is important to highlight that the deployment of these increased resourced across all Children’s Disability Network Teams is an operational matter for the HSE and its lead agencies on a needs driven basis. The Department understands that the geographic allocation of these posts is under consideration by the HSE.  More broadly , the Programme for Government commits to doubling the number of college places for speech and language therapists, physiotherapists, occupational therapists, dietitians, psychologists and social workers.  In June 2025, the Government approved an expansion in training places which will provide up to 461 additional student places by 2028, with the majority commencing in 2025.  Building a skilled pipeline of professionals for Children’s Disability Network Teams involves active and sustained engagement with the employment market and with students, to improve the perception of and interest in working in these teams.  The HSE are continuing to drive intensive domestic and international recruitment efforts and to undertake a portfolio of workforce initiatives to support sustained growth of Children’s Disability Network Teams and the wider disability service.  Alongside recruitment drives, new roles and training pathways are being developed to expand the skills mix and strengthen applicant pools. This includes the development of the role of Health and Social Care Assistant (Therapy Assistant) in 2024.  A dedicated Disability Workforce Strategy will be developed by the HSE in 2026, to meet growing service demands and address recruitment and retention challenges across specialist disability services, including Children’s Disability Network Teams.  While challenges remain, progress has been made in recruitment over recent years, with the overall Children’s Disability Network Teams vacancy rate falling by 11% nationally.  In 2025, the Children’s Disability Network Teams provide supports and services to almost 45,000 children with complex needs. This is an increase of some 2,000 children in receipt of services at the end of December 2024.  Despite increasing pressures on waiting lists across the country, the number of children on Children’s Disability Network Team waiting lists has fallen from nearly 13,000 in January to 10,099 at the end of September, a reduction of 18%.  Notwithstanding the current challenges, both the Government, this Department, the HSE and its funded agencies remain committed to the delivery of appropriate services for children with disabilities and their families and to continue advancing services that meet their needs.  As this question is service query, I have referred it to to the HSE for direct reply. ",

        "answerText": " Deputy Rose Conway-Walsh  Last month, one of Ireland's largest delivery companies went into receivership, leaving 300 direct employees' jobs at risk and impacting a further 600-plus jobs, including subcontractors, franchisees and seasonal workers. These workers have been left in limbo and are still technically employed by Fastway but no longer getting paid. What protections will the Department install for workers to prevent the situation that occurred in Fastway being replicated in other companies, whereby workers and subcontractors are left without any form of income for prolonged periods? \n Minister for Enterprise, Tourism and Employment (Deputy Peter Burke)  I thank the Deputy for this very important question. My thoughts are with all those affected by the receivership and all of their families because I know it is a very difficult and uncertain time.  I also know the news can be very distressing for all of those involved.  Receivership is a long-standing legal mechanism for the enforcement of a security. Usually in Ireland, a receiver is an individual appointed by a lender, such as a bank, to take control of a company's or an individual's assets that were used as security for a loan. In general, a receiver's primary function is to secure the assets of the company, which has been mortgaged or charged in favour of the security holder who appointed him or her, and realise those assets so the secured creditor's debt is repaid as quickly and efficiently as possible. Receivers are independent in the exercise of their functions and I cannot intervene in such matters. Where employees are affected by receivership, the Government works in a co-ordinated way to assist with income supports and employment and training opportunities for those affected.  I received a collective redundancy notification from the receivers of the Nuvion Group on 31 October 2025. I understand the receivers are undertaking a 30-day consultation with employees' representatives as required by law. It is important to note there is no specific statutory restriction on employees from taking up additional employment during the consultation period in circumstances where they are not expected to attend the workplace. Provided they do not resign from the current employment, there should be no obstacle to them retaining their statutory redundancy entitlements.  Where their employer has become insolvent, employees' entitlements are protected under the redundancy payments scheme and redundancy Act. This scheme guarantees employees' statutory redundancy payments and certain wage-related entitlements such as arrears of wages and minimum notice. The receiver is responsible for applying, under the redundancy and insolvency payment schemes, on the employees' behalf. The processing of these claims cannot occur until the termination of the employment has taken place after the 30-day consultation period concludes. Following the completion of the 30-day consultation process, employees may apply for jobseeker's pay-related benefit or jobseeker's allowance, if their employment ends. Employees in need of immediate financial assistance should visit their local Intreo centre social welfare branch office, where an application for an urgent needs payment can be processed as a high priority. \n Deputy Rose Conway-Walsh  I thank the Minister and I know the discussions we are having obviously overlap with the Minister for Social Protection. In these situations, it is very important that there is tight communication between both Departments to put in emergency services. The Minister said people can go to their Intreo offices, but in these situations it is important that dedicated are personnel available to people to answer all of their queries. The huge shock that comes with a receivership announcement leaves hundreds of families devastated. There is a lot of confusion. In particular, what workers and subcontractors were trying to find out was whether any of the payments the Minister cited would impact on their redundancy. They would need written confirmation of that because they do not want to find out, months down the line, that they have taken something that has jeopardised that. It is hugely important that we can protect those workers during prolonged periods without income when their employer has gone into receivership. \n Deputy Peter Burke  I have also been in constant contact with the Department of Social Protection on this issue to ensure employees are supported. We have also been in touch with the Revenue Commissioners, particularly for those who are self-employed and linked to this. I am very clear that the approach the Revenue will take will be a very understanding one, considering the stress of cashflow when people get news like this or a company closes urgently. For those protections, provided the employee does not resign from his or her post, the redundancy is protected. That is the key issue. I am obliged to adhere to the EU collective redundancy directive, which is very clear that the consultation period has to be completed before other supports can be given. We have in place urgent needs support from the Department of Social Protection which will be available to assist employees. There is a lot of judicial precedent around that particular directive, particularly in Luxembourg where a number of cases were taken to ensure Ministers are unable to intervene in that 30-day period. While we are bound by that directive, we are working very closely with employees and their families and any support we can give will be forthcoming, particularly in future. We have to ensure there are huge opportunities in the economy to future-proof their families and get additional income for them at a very difficult time. This is very concerning for families but we are there to support them. \n Deputy Rose Conway-Walsh  It would be very useful if the Minister and the Minister for Social Protection drew up a definitive list of actions and supports. I will work with them in doing that, so that if this situation happens again, we will have something - almost a pack - to present to workers showing them the do's and don'ts of what they are allowed to do, so people will have clarity around that. Will the Minister consider a number of measures to strengthen worker protections in similar circumstances? The first would be to have enhanced oversight of franchising and subcontracting models. Many of these arrangements blur the line between employment and self-employment. We need clearer legal definitions and enforcement to ensure the people doing the work are afforded the rights and protections of workers, including redundancy notice and holiday entitlements, even where corporate structures try to say otherwise. That is critically important.  The Minister must also remember that workers all over the country are impacted by this, including in my constituency. \n Deputy Peter Burke  Absolutely, and I know there was a Fastway depot in my home town of Mullingar where a number of workers are affected. My thoughts are with them. The Government is here to support and work with them under the current framework. I note again the significant challenges presented by the 30-day consultation period, but it is there to protect workers. Any holiday pay or wages that accrue will be paid by the receiver. It is up to the receiver to take details from the self-employed as well, particularly proof of invoices, etc., which is very important for payment of workers later down the line. We have been in very close contact with families and the Department of Social Protection and we are happy to receive any further ideas on how to deal with these matters in the future. There is a lot of legislation in place to protect workers in this regard. If there are any allegations of any other activity, the Corporate Enforcement Authority and An Garda Síochána also stand ready to investigate, should any issues be raised with them. ",

        "answerText": " Deputy Rose Conway-Walsh  I want to talk to the Minister about the proposed omnibus directive and in particular the enterprise committee's concerns that the proposals extend far beyond simplification of burdensome regulations for small and medium enterprises and that these could weaken the due diligence obligations of larger companies. It is really important that we need to know where we stand on it. Is Ireland voting in favour of deregulation or to protect the corporate sustainability due diligence directive? \n Deputy Peter Burke  As the Deputy is aware, simplification and burden reduction is a key issue at EU level with a view to improving EU competitiveness and ensuring there are no disproportionate burdens on business, particularly SMEs. In this context, the omnibus on sustainability was published in February 2025. I wish to acknowledge the work undertaken by the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Enterprise, Tourism and Employment in relation to the omnibus on sustainability. This included public sessions held on 11 and 18 June, the latter of which included participation by officials from my Department in relation to the implications for the corporate sustainability due diligence directive, CSDDD, and the corporate sustainability reporting directive. I have noted the contents of the subsequent report from the joint committee, dated 18 July 2025.  In line with the call from EU leaders to make early progress on this omnibus, a negotiating mandate was agreed by member states on 23 June 2025 on the content aspect of the proposal. I understand that the European Parliament is scheduled to adopt a position on the proposal today, after which it is expected that trilogue negotiations will shortly commence.  I welcome progress on the proposal, which will significantly help EU enterprises and, most notably and critically, SMEs. While changes have been proposed in the published directive, in the context of the EU simplification and burden reduction agenda, the intention remains to promote responsible business conduct. It is envisaged that in-scope companies will continue to be required to conduct risk-based human rights and environmental due diligence and to integrate due diligence into all corporate policies and risk management systems. Ireland has sought to play a constructive role in the negotiations and I will be mindful of the observations of the joint committee when the trilogue negotiations get under way. \n Deputy Rose Conway-Walsh  Everybody agrees on what needs to be done for small and medium businesses in particular, and for any other businesses, in addressing the administrative burden, the duplication and a lot of the nonsense around requirements that are made on businesses. Deputy Charles Ward, my Donegal colleague, is here and when I hear about deregulation, I am mindful of what the defective concrete block scandal is costing us right now. We are going to have to pay billions of euro because of light regulation. I really do not want us to go down that road again.  The Irish Coalition for Business and Human Rights, whose members include ICTU, Christian Aid Ireland, Trócaire, Oxfam, Friends of the Earth Ireland and many other civil organisations and academic experts, says that CSDDD will not be effective unless it includes maintaining the CSDDD risk-based approach to due diligence and allowing companies to focus on prioritise those risks to human rights and the environment within their chain of activity. We really need to get this right. \n Deputy Peter Burke  Anyone who saw the Draghi scorecard published a fortnight ago will see it really points out the implementation process of the simplification revolution and how slow it is. We really need to have an impetus on this. I spoke to all the MEPs in our party in the European Parliament to really get a big push on this. There are six pieces of omnibus legislation currently with the Parliament. We need to see simplification really borne out for our SMEs. We see from the original proposal that 35% of a reduction can be achieved by 2030, with some €37 billion of a saving for SMEs. No one is talking about key regulation that protects our citizens in terms of what the Deputy spoke about in relation to on mica, defective concrete blocks and products like that. That is key for our economy. We have learned a lot over the past decade and previously about our regulatory processes. We have a huge number of regulators in the State now but we need to ensure their interoperability with SMEs can be enhanced, that we do things a little easier, that we are making progress and that we are not putting an unnecessary burden on businesses, which is key for me as an enterprise Minister. \n Deputy Rose Conway-Walsh  I do not think the two things are contradictory in the sense of what we need to do in this space. Obviously, we need to do everything. Small and medium businesses are really struggling right now but we do not need to sacrifice, for example, how we are going to meet our emissions targets or how we are going to ensure that employees' and workers' rights are protected within this space. Maintaining the CSDDD harmonised civil liability regime to prevent fragmentation and increased legal costs and ensuring justice for victims are really important. We also need to ensure that the CSDDD requirement to put into effect climate transition plans is maintained.  We need to protect the CSDDD provisions on stakeholder engagement. The changes brought about by the omnibus proposal not only render the CSDDD ineffective by making sure that companies will fail to identify the most severe risks that take place further down their value chains, but also fail in their stated aim of simplifying legislation. The changes will mean that all due diligence obligations are passed to suppliers. There is a way of getting this right but we need to get the balance right. \n Deputy Peter Burke  This is about simplification. One of the key issues is the need to support our SMEs to ensure the burden placed on them is not inappropriate. With regard to each of the issues mentioned, a risk-based approach will continue, which is important. Stakeholder involvement will be core to the directive, which is also very important.  With regard to harmonised civil liability, obviously national governments will be able to make a determination on this, which is also very important. With regard to our climate policies, it is key that we look at implementation and this is what the new trial will be focused on. It will be focused on the implementation of climate action and how we support businesses to try to embark upon transition. The key issue is that we have too much regulation. We know from our SMEs and businesses the pressure they are under and we need to ensure we have proportionate legislation and that, as an economy, we incentivise innovative approaches and ensure we are protecting citizens. In no way am I talking about watering down the regulatory requirements of key processes in our State, which are so important. This is about doing things quicker. We saw from the Draghi and Letta reports the work we have to do in a European context. Now is the time to get on with the job. ",

        "answerText": " Deputy Rose Conway-Walsh  I want to speak further about Fastway because there is so much to be spoken about. The Minister knows that Fastway is built on a network of local franchisees and subcontractors, many of whom have been the backbone of parcel delivery in rural and regional Ireland. These are small family-run operations which have invested heavily, some of them up to €70,000 in recent months, in vehicles, equipment and staff. That has been based on trust in the system. They worked hard during the pandemic to deliver items to homes in lockdown. Many of them are owed significant sums of money, with no clarity on whether they will ever see it. They are left in limbo too. \n Deputy Peter Burke  I thank the Deputy for this very important question. It relates to a matter which is very close to my heart due to the fact that there is a depot in Mullingar. I very much understand the business model and the pressures that employees and their families face as a result of what happened.  Receivership is a long-standing legal mechanism for the enforcement of a security. Usually in Ireland, a receiver is an individual appointed by a lender, such as a bank, to take control of company assets that were used as security for a loan. In general, a receiver’s primary function is to secure the assets of the company, which have been mortgaged or charged in favour of the security holder who appointed him or her, and realise those assets in order that the secured creditor’s debt is repaid as quickly and efficiently as possible.  Creditors, including other businesses and self-employed contractors impacted by the receivership, should contact the receivers to submit proof of debt and file a claim regarding unpaid moneys and invoices. Revenue has confirmed that it will work with individual couriers and businesses and will be pragmatic in its approach where businesses experience cash-flow difficulties as a result of the loss of business or payments. Businesses experiencing cash-flow issues as a result of these developments may wish to also contact the national enterprise hub in our Department, which provides a wide rang of supports and is a central, all-of-government service to assist businesses.  The Department of Social Protection provides a number of welfare supports and is also on hand to assist. If a person is self-employed as a franchise holder or contractor, they may qualify for the self-employed jobseeker’s benefit if they satisfy PRSI contribution conditions. They can also apply for basic supplementary welfare allowance as an interim payment while their application is being processed, subject to normal eligibility criteria. An employee of a franchise holder or a self-employed contractor who is impacted by the receivership, for example, by being put on temporary lay-off, may apply for jobseeker’s pay-related benefit or jobseeker’s allowance, depending on their PRSI record and means.  Neither I nor my Department have any responsibility in the treatment of packages held by the Nuvion group. Such transactions are a matter between the parties under contract law. I reiterate that any affected businesses should engage with the receivers. \n Deputy Rose Conway-Walsh  Some of that information is useful. I thank the Minister for it. I commend my colleagues Senator Maria McCormack and Councillor Claire Murray who are working in the Laois area and who pulled together all the agencies last week to try to get as much information as possible for people. This is not just a commercial issue; it is about jobs and livelihoods. Every unpaid franchisee and subcontractor struggling to keep afloat represents a potential job loss and another business at risk.  I want to ask the Minister about the packages. He stated that they are not his responsibility, but many small retailers and online sellers have valuable stock that is tied up and that cannot be delivered to their customers. For some, this could represent a critical portion of their Christmas trade. We need to do something to protect those people's jobs. Some of these businesses went to an Post but it stated that it cannot manage the deliveries they need. We are coming into a critical period during which small businesses make a lot of their money. \n Deputy Peter Burke  I am fully aware of the gravity of the situation, particularly for franchisees and small self-employed contractors. The delivery of parcels is a matter of contract law. Delivery timelines relating to orders and the position regarding refunds are very much set out in consumer legislation and, from the point of view of the businesses involved, contract law. I have mentioned this matter to my colleague the Minister, Deputy O'Brien, from a transport perspective. An Post has absorbed some of the capacity, but there are also other providers in the marketplace. This is a challenge, but, critically, the matter is governed by contract law.  There are a number of other opportunities with existing providers for self-employed people and those who are involved in the franchise part of the business. A number of companies have taken some workers on, which is very important. It is key for workers and self-employed people to know that once they do not resign, their entitlement to redundancy, accrued wages and accrued holiday pay - this is important in the context of the consultation period - will not be affected. \n Deputy Rose Conway-Walsh  This incident once again highlights the vulnerability of small operators when large logistic firms collapse. We need to examine the environment in which some companies are allowed to operate. Employees and those who are dependent on them, like subcontractors, need to be notified about what is happening at a very early stage. Earlier, the Minister referred to the fact that we need better corporate law and the ability to investigate, particularly where companies are owned by foreign investment funds. We need to have some way of ensuring that businesses that operate in this State do so in a responsible manner to their employees, the environment and the State. I urge the Minister to treat this not just as a single case of corporate insolvency but also as a wider economic risk and one that could hit hundreds of workers, drivers and small enterprises across the country. \n Deputy Peter Burke  There are huge challenges in our economy in respect of the turnover of jobs, which I, as Minister, can see. There is huge opportunity, but there is also a turnover of jobs every week. The Government is acutely aware of this and is supporting employees through it.  It is clear that the Corporate Enforcement Authority is responsible for policing company law. If there any issues, they should be reported. We have a very strong statutory context that underpins the operation of companies in this State. An Garda Síochána has responsibility in respect of other matters that have been raised and that should be reported. There have been reports in the media about this issue as well.  Critically, we are here to support the workers, the contractors and franchisees. We will do everything we can to ensure that they are paid. This is a particularly important period for families. It can be very challenging. We will be there to support them with urgent payments. I am aware of the challenges many families face because I meet them at my clinics every week. The Government will not be found wanting in the context of supporting them at this difficult time. I assure those involved that training will be provided as well and that they are living in an economy of opportunity. There are opportunities, so they should not lose hope. ",

        "answerText": " An Leas-Cheann Comhairle  Deputy Guirke is taking question No. 81 for Deputy Rose Conway-Walsh. \n Deputy Johnny Guirke  This question relates to the employees of Fastway. \n Deputy Dara Calleary  I thank the Deputy. I also thank Deputy Conway-Walsh for tabling the question and her engagement over recent days about the Fastway workers. All of our thoughts are with the workers affected by this receivership. It is very concerning for all of them and I assure Deputy Guirke that my Department's priority is to support all the workers who are affected and ensure they receive their statutory entitlements and appropriate income supports in a timely manner.  When a company enters receivership, employees are typically placed into a statutory consultation period lasting 30 days. An employee remains in employment during the 30-day consultation period. They continue to accrue an entitlement to wages and holiday pay. That can then be claimed via the insolvency payments scheme if they are unpaid due to the employer's insolvency.  There is no statutory restriction on employees taking up alternative or additional employment during the consultation or receivership period, provided they do not formally resign from their current employment. Accepting other work does not affect an employee's statutory redundancy entitlement as long as the employment contract with their original employer is still in place. Employees should not apply for jobseeker's payments during the consultation period, as they remain employees until employment terminates. Applying prematurely could affect entitlements under redundancy and insolvency payments schemes. Once the consultation period ends and the employment is formally terminated, affected employees may apply for jobseeker's payments.  I assure the Deputy that, in the interim and if immediate financial support is needed, it will be made available through the supplementary welfare allowance scheme. As of yesterday, 45 supplementary welfare allowance scheme urgent needs payments had been issued to people in this situation with Fastway. Other people affected, including the self-employed and franchise and direct employees of contractors, can apply for jobseeker's immediately. As of yesterday, 56 jobseekers claims had been awarded to people in this regard.  My Department has established a dedicated team to work closely with the Fastway liquidators, workers and their representatives to provide guidance, ensure efficient processing of claims and provide opportunities to resolve any queries collectively, where possible. Our local Intreo and employment services offices are available and are assisting affected Fastway staff as we speak. \n Deputy Johnny Guirke  In the run up to Christmas, many of the Fastway workers do not know how they will cope. Rose Conway-Walsh, Senator Maria McCormack, Councillor Claire Murray and I have been meeting every few days and more on these issues as well as on the issues arising that franchise owners are experiencing. Councillor Murray spoke to a franchise owner and issues are coming up regarding the franchise agreement. The way these franchise owners have been treated could be a national scandal.  This receivership announcement is devastating for all affected workers, subcontractors and their families. The timing of this decision could not have been worse. Families are already struggling with the cost-of-living crisis and many now face the real fear of losing their income in the run up to Christmas. I recently met the affected Fastway workers who were protesting outside Leinster House. I heard first hand from the employees. Can I ask the Minister to meet all those affected and listen to their concerns? \n Deputy Dara Calleary  I am listening to concerns directly through the Deputy, Deputy Conway-Walsh and many other Deputies. I have met workers myself in my own constituency. That is why we have put the processes in place that have ensured 45 urgent needs payments have been made and 56 jobseeker's claims have been awarded. The offices are available to the Deputy to process any specific claims he has. I absolutely agree with him about the pressure this is putting on employees and franchise holders. I want to ensure that the supports we can make available at this time can be made available, albeit there this a redundancy process underway. I do not want to see people without an income at any time of the year, but particularly at this time of year. That is why we set up a dedicated team to deal with Fastway workers. Every Intreo office and local employment office in the areas most affected have processes in place to deal with them efficiently and quickly. If there are specific cases the Deputy wants to raise, the team in the Department are more than happy to engage with the him or any Member of the Oireachtas directly in relation to that. \n Deputy Johnny Guirke  As the Minister knows, these workers and all those impacted deserve clear communication and support from both the company and the Government. Some franchisees have invested heavily to establish their franchises. This must be taken into consideration. Workers need an income and certainty. The Government must engage with the receiver and ensure that all avenues are explored to safeguard jobs, protect workers and ensure those owed money are not left behind.  Senator Maria McCormack and Councillor Claire Murray hosted a public meeting for the workers and subcontractors affected by the closure of Fastway's Portarlington depot. People travelled all the way from Cork, Donegal and all over Ireland to join a jam-packed room. Franchise owners who recently bought into the franchise with Fastway have bought vans on finance and spent €50,000-plus on the franchise.  Now they are left with repayments they cannot meet. Those affected feel like they are being left in the dark. They are fearful that red tape will stop them getting fair payments. Will the Minister ensure the Government does all to support the workers and franchise owners to make sure they are not forgotten about and to protect workers rights throughout this receivership process? \n Deputy Eoin Hayes  I thank the Minister and his officials for creating a task force for the Fastway workers. I am conscious that we are not just talking about people who are in typical employment situations. We are talking about people who are self-employed, who are contractors and who are franchisees. According to the information I have, about 1,000 people are in that category as opposed to the 300 who were employed by Fastway directly. When we think about the self-employed provision that is available from the Department for people who will never be paid again, who are out of pocket, in some cases by tens of thousands of euro, there is a huge shift in our employment more generally towards the self-employed population. Having appropriate social protection provision for those people is a key issue we need to solve in this phase of employment. I am also particularly conscious of the fallout for those franchisees. Are any legal routes for them in recouping the moneys that they spent as a result of the franchisee arrangement they had with Fastway? If the Minister can give clarity on that, it would be helpful. \n Deputy Dara Calleary  I thank both Deputies. As I said in relation to the franchisees, the self-employed and the employees of contractors of Fastway, they can apply for jobseekers' payment immediately. We have processed and awarded 56 claims already in relation to that group of people. The work my Department team is doing at the moment is working with receivers, getting records of who is an employee and who is not and who is a franchisee, and getting that level of detail. That has been under way since the company entered into receivership. I thank the staff in my Department who are working on that team. They engaged with this immediately when this issue arose. That team is in place. The offices in the relevant areas are being given resources to deal with this quickly and, most importantly, as they always do, empathetically, particularly given the circumstances of this and to ensure we get decisions turned around quickly. We have done 45 urgent-need payments and 56 jobseekers' claims. That gives a sense of the focus and attention this is getting within the Department. ",

On receiving the notification of proposed collective redundancy from the company concerned, my Department’s Employer Relations team made contact with the company to arrange to meet locally with affected employees to provide information on income, redundancy entitlements and employment supports. Meetings with the staff concerned are taking place this week.  Employees of the group have not been laid off but are in a 30-day consultation period from 31 October 2025. This means that they remain in employment during this period and continue to accrue an entitlement to wages. In order to protect their entitlements direct employees should not apply for a Jobseeker’s payment at this point as they are still considered employees of the company.  Employees in need of urgent financial assistance should visit their local Intreo Centre or Social Welfare Branch Office, where an application for Supplementary Welfare Allowance will be processed as a matter of urgency.  Following the completion of the consultation process, and if their employment ends, affected employees can apply for Jobseeker’s Pay-Related Benefit if they have sufficient PRSI contributions, or for the means-tested Jobseeker’s Allowance.  Self-employed franchise holders or contractors may qualify for Jobseeker’s Benefit (Self-Employed).  Direct employees of a franchise holder or self-employed contractor impacted by the receivership who are now on temporary layoff may apply for Jobseeker's Pay-Related Benefit or Jobseeker’s Allowance, depending on PRSI record and means. Supplementary Welfare Allowance is available pending decisions on their primary payment.  Employed workers may be entitled to redundancy benefits if they are laid off. If these cannot be covered by their employer, the Department of Social Protection’s Redundancy and Insolvency scheme is available. Where an employer or insolvency practitioner is unable to pay wages owed to employees due to insolvency, the receiver can apply for payment of arrears of wages from the Insolvency Payments Scheme following termination of employment.

The specific terms that apply to any individual depend primarily on the date a person joins the PDF and on whether that person is joining the Public Service for the first time. Their entitlements also depend on their specific circumstances and on many variables including rank, pensionable service and pensionable remuneration.  The main dates of joining that dictate a difference in the pension terms which apply are:  • before 1 April 2004 [the DF Pre-2004 Pension Scheme],  • after 1 April 2004 but before 1 January 2013 [the DF Post-2004 Pension Scheme],  • after 1 January 2013 [the Single Pension Scheme]  The Deputy’s query appears to refer to a specific scenario in relation to enlisted personnel who joined the Permanent Defence Forces (PDF) before April 2004.   Where enlisted personnel leave the DF with less than 21 years’ service and have no entitlement to a pension, and then rejoin the public service after a break of 26 weeks, they are then a member of the Single Pension Scheme, in accordance with the 2012 Act.  It is important to note that the DF Pre-2004 Scheme is a non-contributory scheme, as such members do not pay explicit main scheme contributions.  There is no facility to transfer benefits accrued in pre-existing public service pension schemes into the Single Scheme. This is the case for all public servants who are members of that Scheme.   However there is provision to purchase additional benefits under the Single Scheme.  Where an individual holds a pension entitlement under both a pre-existing public service pension scheme and the Single Scheme, this will give rise to separate benefits payable  in accordance with the terms of the scheme(s) concerned.  In the case outlined in question, the person would not have an entitlement to a pension but would have entitlement to a short service gratuity.  This is payable at flat rates that depend on retiring rank and qualifying service.

The Cabinet committee on disability has been established to oversee the implementation of the programme for Government commitments in the area of disability, with specific focus on children's disability services as well as disability more generally under the Government's new National Human Rights Strategy for Disabled People 2025-2030.  Under the programme for Government, we are committed to delivering a step change in disability services and to advancing the rights and improving the lives of people with disabilities. To deliver on this, I established the stand-alone Cabinet committee on disability. This committee has met five times to date, most recently on 16 October, and it is due to meet again on 27 November. To date, the committee has considered issues including the new national disability strategy, the provision of therapists in special schools, improving the delivery of services and reform of the assessment of need process.  Despite the committed efforts of so many working to provide services and significant increases in funding and resources in recent years, I acknowledge that we can and must do more and do better. I am determined that this will be a Government that moves forward with purpose in improving the level, scale and quality of support for disabled people and their families.  The Government's new National Human Rights Strategy for Disabled People 2025-2030, published in September, is the framework for our whole-of-government approach to addressing disability and advancing the implementation of the United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities. It represents our commitment and ambition that all disabled people in Ireland can live the life of their choosing and participate in their communities and our society to the fullest extent possible.  In budget 2026, we took initial steps to deliver on this commitment through record allocations for disabilities services and special education. Reflecting the importance of disability issues, I have established a dedicated disability unit in my Department.  An initial programme planned for the unit has been published, outlining how the unit will work to achieve this. The unit is already up and running, supporting the work of the Cabinet committee on disability and ensuring a truly all-of-government approach to disability. \n Deputy Aisling Dempsey  I want to raise the urgent issue of the transition from child disability services to adult disability services. A constituent has told me that her child was not seen by child disability services until he was almost 18 and that was eight years post her first contact. The family had no clarity on what supports they were entitled to when he was a child, let alone what they were facing into from adult disability services. Another constituent - another mother - has told me some therapies her child receives now are not going to be available in adult disability services. Somehow, her adult child will not have the same needs any more. In this case, respite will also be withdrawn when her child ages out of child disability services. This is leaving families feeling anxious, unsupported and fearful for their family's future. Will the Taoiseach and the committee urgently examine the transition process between child and adult disability services to ensure continuity of care and no loss of essential supports for young people and their families? \n Deputy Catherine Ardagh  One of the greatest fears facing parents of children with disabilities and parents of adult children with disabilities is what will happen when we are no longer here. Who will care for my son? Who will care for all of these children, including adult children? It is a question that causes sleepless nights for so many people. Ultimately, we need a clear, compassionate pathway for lifelong housing and care in the community for adults with disabilities, so families can have certainty and peace of mind.  Will the Government commit to developing a national plan to ensure that every person with a disability has a safe, permanent home and the supports they need, not just for today but for the future? All of us have been in many houses in our constituencies and we have met elderly parents caring for middle-aged children with disabilities. It is heartbreaking that they are in their senior years and they do not know what is going to happen to their son or daughter when they pass. We have all dealt with these types of queries. It is something that lies ahead for me and my family also. We need to start discussing housing and care in the community for people with disabilities. \n Deputy Martin Daly  I am following on from what my colleague Deputies have already said about the care of the offspring of people who are getting older and have no certainty around what is going to happen when they are not here any more. It is a major challenge within the community. It seems like a cliff edge. When you die, you get a residency. That is not good enough. There has got to be planning around that, and it should be seamless.  A lot of work has been done on the provision of special education classes, and special school place provision. We have done stuff around increasing the income disregard for the carer's allowance and we are getting to an abolishment of the means test but also I think we need to address flexible arrangements around getting more people who live with disability into work and out of poverty without losing their benefits. The cost of disability payment should be considered also. There is a lot of work to be done. The direction is right but we do need a huge focus on it. \n Deputy Peadar Tóibín  It is 420 days since I asked the Tánaiste, Deputy Simon Harris, about why Harvey Morrison Sherratt was taken off the waiting list. The Tánaiste has not been able to answer that question in those 420 days. That is an incredible indictment in relation to it. He said in the Dáil that he would immediately ask the HSE and that he would ask the Minister for Health, yet no question has been answered.  We saw in The Sunday Times this weekend that a protected disclosure was submitted to the Department of Health. The information in this protected disclosure is catastrophic. The implication is that someone, or a group, took a decision that was not medically based and may have led to the death of Harvey. That is a catastrophic question. The import of that on a government is absolutely enormous. What the Government is asking us to believe is that on one level, the Tánaiste has spent 420 days asking questions in relation to why Harvey was taken off the waiting list and he still did not get an answer and, at the same time, a protected disclosure was given to the Department of Health with the answer. That is an incredible thing.  Does the Government understand the import of what has just happened? Why has it taken 420 days for the Tánaiste to answer a question? Have the staff or the management involved actually been asked what has happened? \n An Leas-Cheann Comhairle  I thank the Deputy. \n Deputy Peadar Tóibín  Are they refusing to answer what has happened? Why is it that the family only found out through The Sunday Times what happened in relation to their child? \n An Leas-Cheann Comhairle  I am sorry that I overlooked Deputy Coppinger. \n Deputy Ruth Coppinger  That is no problem.  Governments have fallen over less than what has happened in relation to Harvey Morrison Sherratt. We found out over the weekend through a protected disclosure that a worker heard or became aware that Harvey had been taken off the waiting list because he was mistakenly, or for whatever reason, considered \"palliative\" - in itself a horrible phrase. First, his parents were not told and, second, no care plan or treatment plan was drawn up if he was \"palliative\". This just defies belief. Aside from the fact that he may have ended up dying because of this error, perhaps if he had received the surgery, he would not be dead. The fact is that we have surgeons who would not tell parents about this and who would not organise a care plan for a \"palliative\" child. Every week, we come in here and ask the Taoiseach to have a statutory public inquiry. The Government's stance has been to have a scoping inquiry here and a scoping inquiry there. We need a full statutory inquiry into all of the issues surrounding Harvey, CHI and spinal surgery. The Taoiseach should have asked questions since this broke on Sunday, given how important this issue is in Ireland for so many people. \n An Leas-Cheann Comhairle  I thank the Deputy. \n Deputy Ruth Coppinger  He should have asked CHI directly about this particular issue, so I hope he has answers for us today. \n Deputy Mark Ward  I was at a public meeting last Monday in Neilstown hosted by parents of children with disabilities. They raised a multitude of areas and how their children are being failed. There are long waiting lists for assessment of need, speech and language therapy and occupational therapy. There is no access to appropriate school places. There are limited SNA allocations. They also talked about not even getting appropriate places for school transport and arbitrary timeframes for filling out forms. If they do not fill out the forms within the timeframe, there are consequences for their children.  I got a response this morning saying the average wait time for an assessment of need in my area of Dublin Mid-West is three and a half years, even though the statutory timeframe is six months. Children are being denied the right to reach their full potential. How is the Government going to address the failures children are experiencing? \n Deputy Paul Murphy  The budget reneged on a key commitment in the programme for Government to introduce a permanent annual cost of disability support payment and then to incrementally increase it. We know that it costs a lot of money to be disabled in this country. A few years ago, the Department of Finance estimated it at around €10,000. It has obviously gone up substantially since then. Last year's €400 lump sum disability payment was a drop in the ocean but far from increasing it, as promised, the Government abolished it completely. It slashed other payments that disabled people rely on, like the living alone allowance lump sum and the electricity credit. Even taking into account small increases to the disability allowance, the Government still took well over €1,000 out of the pockets of disabled people. It is shocking in one of the richest countries in the world, with a budget surplus and with the cost-of-living crisis ongoing, that the Government made disabled people poor. That is not just in real inflationary terms but even in nominal terms. \n An Leas-Cheann Comhairle  I thank the Deputy. \n Deputy Paul Murphy  The Government made them poorer, and took over €1,000 from them. Will it recognise this as a major mistake? Will it bring back an emergency lump sum cost-of-living payment for disabled people before Christmas? \n Deputy Ruairí Ó Murchú  I want to bring up the attempt by Darver National School in County Louth to have two autism classes sanctioned. The initial engagement between the principal, the SENO and the NCSE took place in June 2025. This was followed up throughout September and October, with no word back. It is absolutely supported by the patrons and the board of management and all have tried to make contact. We need to ensure that this happens but we also need to ensure that the school is contacted.  I do not think this is okay. I am just giving the timeframe on this.  I also need someone to light a fire under the Department of education in relation to Ardee Educate Together National School. Louth County Council is the agent but the Department ----- \n An Leas-Cheann Comhairle  Thank you Deputy. \n Deputy Ruairí Ó Murchú  This relates to parking spaces and planning. It should be a very small piece of work to get this changed to account for the 45 staff and also enough bays for the minibuses. At this point, there is not space. It would be very cheap to get it changed at this point. A contractor is on for this. If not at this point, then we could be talking about something that could cost €100,000-plus. \n Deputy Barry Heneghan  Is there an update or timeline from the Cabinet committee on disability on assessments of need?  In my own constituency, Stapolin Educate Together primary school is looking for two additional autism classes. It has a very powerful image of 12 chairs outside that school representing children locked out. I would urge the Taoiseach push----- \n The Taoiseach  Which school? \n Deputy Barry Heneghan  Stapolin in Dublin Bay North. I can send details to the Taoiseach’s office. These children are locked out. I urge that the NCSE look at this school. It has brilliant staff who are really hard working.  Gabhaim míle buíochas leis an Aire, Deputy McEntee, i dtaobh Ghaelcholáiste Reachrann. Tá sé iontach go bhfuil rudaí ag bogadh ar aghaidh air sin. \n Deputy Conor D. McGuinness  The Government is failing children in Waterford with additional needs over the stagnation in early intervention classes. Five years ago, there were two early intervention classes across Waterford city and county. This year, there are still two. That is despite an increasing need and a demand that is there but unmet. These early interventions are critical for children’s educational and social outcomes. It is something that the Taoiseach’s Government needs to grapple with. Over the last nine or ten months, we have seen issues around special education spaces and classes in schools. While the Government did belatedly do some work to fill some of those gaps in service provision, there is a lot more to do. That situation is still there and I think there will be problems next year. We need to get to grips with the early intervention classes and increase them dramatically so that there is availability for parents to get their children that much-needed timely intervention. \n Deputy Liam Quaide  The plight of ageing parents of adult children with intellectual disabilities is an area of abject neglect on the part of the Government. Many of these parents are being deprived of peace of mind in their later years because they remain the primary carers of their children. They are less physically able to carry out this role as time goes on. They are living with a constant background worry of not knowing where their children will live after they die and how their need for belonging and community will be met.  The Government’s privatisation of services means that both young people and adults who require 24-hour staffed residential support are increasingly living far from home, in some cases hundreds of kilometres away, not connected to wrap-around services, detached from their communities and families. What is the Taoiseach’s plan to address this particular crisis in residential services for people with intellectual disabilities? Why are these services being privatised and fragmented to such an extent when the outcomes in many cases are so poor for our disabled citizens and when the cost to the State is so enormous? \n Deputy Rose Conway-Walsh  It is an absolute disgrace that even today we still do not know which children were wrongly removed from the scoliosis waiting list or why it happened. Families have been left in the dark while children suffer in pain. There is a clear culture of secrecy, concealment and unaccountability at the heart of children’s healthcare and an utter lack of transparency. I want to talk to the Taoiseach again, after many other times I have done so, about Mikey Henry Benson from Mayo, who is still waiting for the procedures he needs. I want to ask the Taoiseach to ask the Minister for Health when she is in Mayo on Monday to meet the family of Mikey Henry Benson to go through the episodes and the pain they have gone through and to find a way forward so that we can ensure that Mikey Henry Benson stays alive? \n Deputy Cian O'Callaghan  The Government has said time and again that there should be an appropriate school place for every child. I am contacted constantly by parents who are desperately trying to get a place for their child in an autism class. The same as any other parent, they just want their child to be able to thrive. Stapolin Educate Together National School in Baldoyle has asked to open two additional new autism classes. The school has the space for the modular units required. It also has experienced staff who can support the opening of these two additional classes. All that is required is for approval to be granted. Is the Minister for education going to meet the school principal about this and when is approval going be granted for these two much-needed classes? \n Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett  While I was getting my treatment in St. Luke's, I met a very nice woman called Shirley who brought up her daughter Lauren's case with me. Lauren subsequently wrote to me. Lauren lives with her and has a life-long disability condition that means she is unfit for work. She had previously been on domiciliary care allowance, then on disability allowance, but she then got married. She lives at home with her mum still, being cared for by her mum, but because she got married and went over the threshold, her disability payment has been cut. It really highlights the massive problem and injustice of having means testing of disability payments. What does the Taoiseach have to say to Lauren and many others like her who lose all support for their disability on the basis that their partner’s income has gone over a very arbitrary threshold? \n An Leas-Cheann Comhairle  We are gone way over time, so I would ask the Taoiseach to consider that. \n The Taoiseach  We are about seven minutes over time, is it? \n An Leas-Cheann Comhairle  Yes. \n The Taoiseach  I will try to do what I can as quickly as I can. \n An Leas-Cheann Comhairle  No, you are okay. Just ----- \n The Taoiseach  No, I am conscious of others.  Deputy Dempsey raised the issue of transition from child services to adult services and that there was an absence of early planning for that. She also made the comment that parents were told that therapies would not be available in transition. That is not acceptable and respite should not be withdrawn. In the disability unit that I have established, a key workstream will be planning and designing for the future. There should be proper data and proper early analysis of expected need for services from primary to post-primary, from post-primary to adult or, indeed, continuing education or other aspects. That is where I want to get to and that is where we want to get to as a Government because there is no doubt - Deputy Ardagh has raised this as well, as have others - that the insecurity is shocking. It is very sad that so many parents – I have met them – have no certainty. Deputy Daly said it was a cliff edge, and it is for many. If one talks to some of the providers in the sections 38 and 39 organisations, they are all dealing with emergency cases. That is not satisfactory, so we have got to get a more planned approach to this transition. I think there are also issues in terms of the interaction between the sections 38 and 39 organisations and the Government and Government services and how that works. Many of those are under pressure as well, I have to acknowledge, but equally we have to work out the models and so forth. There should be proper databases outlining how many people are in a given service at a given time and what will the requirements be at a later date. There is that issue of creating a secure transition and that older parents in particular, senior citizens now, have a certain sense of security and knowledge well in advance that their children will be looked after in case anything happens to themselves. That is a very understandable human concern, which is not being met at the moment but that needs to be met. I am very determined that we would put services in place to enable that to happen. There is a fear there, as Deputy Ardagh said. She called for a national plan for this and that is something I am going to work on so that people will have that security. Other Deputies have raised that issue. We should be looking at a seamless transition, ideally.  There is a link into housing as well in that respect, different solutions at different times in the journey of life that people can move to better accommodation, more suitable accommodation. We should have greater flexibility around that provision. There can be too many silos between different Government Departments in respect of that but we are working on it. That is what the Cabinet subcommittee is for, to do a cross-government, whole-of-government approach.  Deputy Daly and others raised the income disregard and the cost of disability. The cost of disability will be looked at in the next budget and there is a working group established in relation to that. On the relationship between work and disability payments, there are some supports there for transitioning from disability, from the social protection system, into work in terms of the medical card and others. I think that can be strengthened and that those moving into work can be given greater certainty, more long-term certainty, that they will retain their benefits or whatever entitlements they have as they go into work. There have been improvements on the employer grant and so on but there is further work to be done in terms of giving greater security around that transition and encouraging people to go into work without fear of losing their health entitlements or the various other entitlements they have.  Earlier during Leaders' Questions, we dealt with questions in respect of Harvey Morrison Sherratt. I would say to the Deputy the Minister is this afternoon meeting with the parents. The Minister did look for a chronology from the HSE. The Minister has that. The CEO of the HSE shared that with the family. It is a draft because the HSE wanted the family's input into that. I dealt with the protected disclosure earlier on Leaders' Questions. The Minister did not see that. All protected disclosures do not go to the Ministers per se . The Minister has an obligation to establish a system by which it goes to the protected disclosure commissioner. That commissioner has the specific protected disclosure and is now going to deal with that. Without question, there is a meeting on between the Minister, the Tánaiste and the parents of Harvey, with a view to an inquiry. The precise format is to be determined.  Deputy Coppinger had a similar question in relation to this. It is a fundamental question as to why Harvey was taken off a waiting list. There are clinical decisions clearly involved here that have to be examined and will be examined. Likewise, there are other, broader investigations and examinations of issues pertaining to CHI, as the Deputy knows. Some of them have come in and some have not. Overall, again, terms of reference have to be specific here. We can have statutory inquiries that can go on too long and do not give closure to families. I think there is a bit of work to be done yet and the Minister is meeting with the family in that regard.  Deputy Murphy raised the issue of the cost of disability programme. I dealt with that earlier insofar as the next budget will be dealing with that. Once-off payments were two years. What we were determined to do in this budget was to increase the permanent payments within the social protection system, which we did, for example, and to enhance them as well and also, in terms of the carer's allowance threshold and income disregard, to increase that and we will eliminate that over the lifetime of this Government. We increased the domiciliary care allowance significantly.  In terms of education, there are now about 46,500 teachers and SNAs working in our education system, committed to supporting and nurturing children with special educational needs. Huge numbers of special needs assistants have been appointed over the past number of years. There are about 400 new special classes in the budget of 2025, and about 2,700 new places for the 2025-2026 school year. Some of those school places are under construction and being put in place. A number of specifics have been asked. I will check those out with the Minister. I am not in a position to have knowledge of every single application from individual schools in respect of autism classes and so forth but I will follow those up with the Minister. I presume the Deputies are also engaging with the Departments in respect of that.  On the assessment of need, the Cabinet subcommittee on disability did approve outline proposals for a change in legislation which will have to happen to prioritise the provision of services. Therapy services to children has been the number one priority in terms of the legislative objective of that. The access and inclusion model, AIM, is a critical intervention for early years in terms of disability, in response to Deputy McGuinness's question. I would make that point and that has been enhanced and improved and will be improved as a result of the recent budget. Deputies Quaide, Dempsey and Ardagh raised the issue of insecurity and worry for ageing parents of children with disabilities. I am very conscious of that and we will work to see if we can improve on that.  I have dealt with the issue raised by Deputy Conway-Walsh. I response to Deputy Cian O'Callaghan, I will check in respect of the school in Baldoyle. I do not have awareness of that. In response to Deputy Boyd Barrett, again, I do not know the specific issue but I think it is an income threshold issue in terms of people marrying. \n Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett  It is, yes, the means test. \n The Taoiseach  I will have that examined. That is something that we can certainly look at. I will talk to the Minister for Social Protection in relation to that. \n Deputy Rose Conway-Walsh  Sorry, I think the Taoiseach was referring to the previous question. It was the one on Mikey Henry-Benson I had asked. \n The Taoiseach  Sorry. Again, I will talk to the Minister in respect of it. To be fair, this should be done at hospital level. It should be done properly through the clinicians properly engaging with the family and with the parents. There are liaison officers in CHI as well who should be----- \n Deputy Rose Conway-Walsh  I know it should but it was not and it is not. \n The Taoiseach  I will make the Minister aware of the case. \n Deputy Rose Conway-Walsh  Thank you. \n Deputy Ruairí Ó Murchú  On the two issues, if I could write to the Taoiseach and if his good offices would be able to put some pressure on----- \n The Taoiseach  There are about ten projects now that you have all mentioned. I am good but----- \n Deputy Ruairí Ó Murchú  In fairness these are critical time-wise. ",
