        "answerText": " Minister for Health  The Health Service Executive (HSE) has statutory responsibility for decisions on pricing and reimbursement of medicines under the community drug schemes, in accordance with the provisions of the Health (Pricing and Supply of Medical Goods) Act 2013. Reimbursement is for licensed indications which have been granted market authorisation by the European Medicines Agency (EMA) or the Health Products Regulatory Authority (HPRA).  In line with the 2013 Act and the national framework agreed with industry, a company must submit an application to the HSE to have a new medicine added to the reimbursement list. In making a relevant reimbursement decision, the HSE is required under the Act to have regard to a number of criteria including efficacy, the health needs of the public, cost effectiveness and potential or actual budget impact. HSE decisions on which medicines are reimbursed are made on objective, scientific and economic grounds, on the advice of the National Centre for Pharmacoeconomics (NCPE).  Ozempic® (Semaglutide) is indicated for the treatment of adults with insufficiently controlled type 2 diabetes mellitus as an adjunct to diet and exercise; as monotherapy when metformin is considered inappropriate due to intolerance or contraindications; and in addition to other medicinal products for the treatment of diabetes. Ozempic® (Semaglutide) is not licensed for the treatment of weight management in a non-diabetic population.  Ozempic® (Semaglutide) was approved by the HSE in September 2018 for addition to the reimbursement list in accordance with its licensed indication (see www.ncpe.ie/semaglutide-ozempic/).  Controls are currently in place within the HSE's Primary Care Reimbursement Service (PCRS) in relation to Ozempic® (Semaglutide) to restrict reimbursement support to the approved indication. It is for this reason that reimbursement for Ozempic® (Semaglutide) is confined to those with eligibility under the General Medical Services Scheme (GMS) or the Long-Term Illness (LTI) scheme and is not made available on the Drugs Payment Scheme.  In accordance with the provisions of the Health Act 1970 (as amended), eligibility for a medical card under the GMS Scheme is determined by the HSE by means of a financial assessment. In certain circumstances, the HSE may exercise discretion and grant a medical card, even though an applicant exceeds the income guidelines, where he or she faces difficult financial circumstances, such as extra costs arising from illness.  The LTI Scheme was established under Section 59(3) of the Health Act 1970 (as amended). Regulations were made prescribing 16 conditions covered by the Scheme, including diabetes mellitus. ",

        "answerText": " Minister of State at the Department of Education  This government is fully committed to supporting children with special educational needs to fulfil their full potential and the Programme for Government makes a number of commitments to deliver on this objective. The National Council for Special Education (NCSE) has responsibility for coordinating and advising on the education provision for children with special educational needs.  By the end of the year there will be over 20,800 special educational teachers and 23,400 SNAs in our mainstream classes, special classes and special schools. This will mean we will have over 44,200 teachers and SNAs working in our education system committed to supporting and nurturing children with special educational needs, enabling them to achieve their best outcomes and reach their full potential.  SNAs play a central role in the successful inclusion of students with additional and significant care needs into schools. They help ensure that these students can access an education to enable them to achieve their best outcomes and reach their full potential.  SNAs are allocated to schools as a school-based resource. Principals/board of management deploy SNAs within schools to meet the care support requirements of the children enrolled whom SNA support has been allocated. This provides schools flexibility in how the SNA support is utilised.  The NCSE has published the SNA allocations for the 2024/25 school year. For ease of reference these allocations are broken down by school type and are available at: www.ncse.ie/set-hours-and-sna-allocations  If a school feels like it has insufficient SNA support to meet the needs of its students an application can be submitted to the NCSE requesting a review of its allocation. Detailed information on the NCSE's SNA review process is published on the NCSE's website . Each case is individually assessed and is based on the student profile of each school.  My Department does not have a role in the allocation of Special Needs Assistants (SNA) to individual schools.  The NCSE has the responsibility for planning and coordinating school supports for children with special educational needs including the allocation of SNAs and SNA reviews.  As your question relates to the SNA allocation in an individual school, I have forwarded the question to the NCSE for their direct response to you on the matter raised.  My department and the NCSE are committed to delivering an education system that is of the highest quality and where every child and young person feels valued and is actively supported and nurtured to reach their full potential.

The National Transport Authority (NTA) has responsibility for the regulation of fares charged to passengers in respect of public transport services provided under public service obligation (PSO) contracts.  Under Budget 2025, funding has been allocated to the Department of Transport to extend free public transport for children to include those aged 5 to 8 years. Free travel for all children under-fives on subsidised public transport services was introduced in 2017.  The extension will be introduced later this year, with a lead time involved to allow for the necessary technical changes required to facilitate the implementation of this change to child fares.

        "answerText": " Minister for Finance  The Capital Markets Union (CMU) is a flagship project within EU financial services policy which aims to deepen and further integrate Europe’s capital markets, support growth and enhance the resilience of the financial system. For Ireland, CMU has the potential to widen the sources of available funding for our companies as well as provide opportunities for our export-oriented financial services sector to contribute to a more dynamic and resilient EU economy.  It is widely recognised that, notwithstanding the significant progress made during the 2019-2024 EU legislative term in advancing the CMU under the Action Plan, more remains to be done. The Eurogroup (in inclusive format) embarked on a thematic assessment on the future of CMU and in March 2024 issued a statement which sets out priority areas of action and concrete measures for taking forward the CMU.  Ireland supports the statement and roadmap set out by the Eurogroup, which provides a solid way forward to develop proposals for legislative measures to progress the CMU. There has also been a number of high-level reports in the past year which address the future direction of the CMU, such as the Enrico Letta Report, Christian Noyer Report and Mario Draghi Report, as well as a paper by the European Securities and Markets Authority on how to build more effective and attractive capital markets.  Ireland is a strong supporter of the CMU project. In November 2024, Ireland along with 8 other Member States put forward a vision for a multi-centre of excellence CMU that can leverage the benefits of existing market places and infrastructures within Member States. Making progress on CMU would facilitate deeper integration of Ireland’s capital market with other EU markets, augmenting competitiveness, attracting increased investment and fostering growth in innovation and sustainability. At EU level, a further deepening of the EU’s capital markets will be instrumental in unlocking the significant levels of funding that European companies require to scale up, innovate, and become more competitive, as well as to manage the green and digital transitions.  In particular, there are areas highlighted in the Joint Statement that Ireland and others believe will offer the most return on impact and deliverability, and these include:  • support the development of national capital markets and their greater integration within EU capital markets (bottom-up measures),  • increase retail investor participation,  • stimulate (in particular) equity funding for start-ups and scale-ups,  • simplify the regulatory environment,  • revitalise the securitisation market,  • remove barriers that impede the seamless use of the EU passport and hence the marketing and distribution of cross-border pan-European products and services.  Further progress on completing the CMU will require a combination of complementary top-down EU measures and bottom-up national measures. It is the collective responsibility of the EU institutions, the Members States, including its regulatory authorities, and of course capital markets participants, to ensure that further progress is made on the CMU. Ireland will continue to play a constructive and active role in this important endeavour. ",

        "answerText": " Minister for Education and Skills  I propose to take Questions Nos. 438 and 439 together.  School Transport is a significant operation managed by Bus Éireann on behalf of the Department of Education and Skills.  The purpose of my Department's School Transport Scheme is, having regard to available resources, to support the transport to and from school of children who reside remote from their nearest school  In the 2019/20 school year over 120,000 children, including over 14,200 children with special educational needs, were transported in over 5,000 vehicles on a daily basis to primary and post-primary schools throughout the country covering over 100 million kilometres at a cost of over €219m in 2019..  The decision taken by the Government to close schools with effect from 13th March 2020 was taken in the interest of protecting our pupils, their families, teachers and those members of the wider community and is one of the many measures taken to support efforts to contain the spread of Covid-19.  Given that the school transport services have not been available to children from 13th March, it was decided that at the end of the current school year a refund for that period of closure will be issued to parents. My Department has been engaging with Bus Éireann in developing a plan for facilitating these refunds and I can confirm that refunds will be issued directly to all entitled family account holders. The refunds process has commenced and refunds to those families who paid by cheque issued last week. With regard to families who paid by card, Bus Éireann has confirmed that they will be shortly emailing all families due to receive a refund to advise them of arrangements. ",

The staffing schedule includes an appeals mechanism for schools to submit a staffing appeal under certain criteria to an independent Appeals Board. The appeal from the school submitted by the Deputy was considered by the Primary Staffing Appeals Board and deemed ineligible as the appeal did not meet the criteria published in Circular 18/2020.  The Primary Staffing Appeals Board is independent of the Department and its decision is final.

        "answerText": " Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport  I recognise that from the onset of the COVID-19 Emergency and the introduction of restrictions as part of the necessary public health response, passenger demand for taxis and other small public service vehicle (SPSV) services fell considerably and many operators stopped working.  The National Transport Authority (NTA) - the agency under my aegis which regulates the taxi industry - took action to reduce the immediate financial burden on SPSV operators and to make it easier for them to return to the industry when circumstances change. These actions included licence extensions and the waiver of late licence renewal fees. The NTA has also engaged with the motor insurance industry to facilitate a suspension of SPSV insurance for those SPSV operators who decided to temporarily stop working and suspend their licences. Operators who suspended their licences will be able to either reduce their monthly premium or receive a refund from their insurer, depending on their individual arrangements with their insurer.  In recognition of the challenges facing businesses, the Government also put in place a range of measures to assist businesses during the current COVID-19 pandemic, including the COVID-19 Wage Subsidy Scheme, the COVID-19 Restart Grant, and a waiver of commercial rates. Self-employed owner operators of SPSVs may also avail of the COVID-19 Pandemic Unemployment Payment of €350 a week that was introduced.  At the present time, given the range of financial supports available, I do not see the need for additional supports for the SPSV industry. However, noting that the Pandemic Unemployment Payment is scheduled to end on 10 August 2020, this question will be kept under continual review by Government. In addition, my Department is in regular contact with the NTA to monitor the impact the reopening of the economy in line with the Government's Roadmap to Reopening Society and Business is having on demand for SPSV services and to ensure that SPSV operators who have temporarily stopped working are well placed to return to work.

It builds on data returned to Revenue through the PAYE system and as such is a fully automated solution. The automated solution, which was developed in a very short timeframe in response to the pandemic, is designed around the dates specified in the legislation and cannot function where those timelines are not strictly adhered to. The timelines require that employees were on the payroll at 29 February 2020 and that employers had fulfilled their PAYE reporting obligations for February 2020 before 15 March 2020.  The 15 March 2020 deadline in respect of the February payroll submission was recently extended to ‘before’ 1 April 2020 by Revenue under its care and management provisions. However, this concession can only apply where all previous payroll submissions were received by 15 March 2020. The concession is also only applicable on a prospective basis and cannot be applied to previous pay periods. The employer must also record a J9 PRSI class for each eligible employee in the relevant payroll submission to access the TWSS. Where the J9 PRSI class is not recorded, then the system cannot ‘identify’ an employee as being eligible for the subsidy.  I am advised by Revenue that the difficulties experienced by the business in question in accessing the TWSS occurred because it recorded PRSI classes other than J9 for its employees, which resulted in them being excluded from the scheme. Following direct engagement with Revenue, the matter was rectified and the business has access to the scheme since 12 June. ",

I am advised by Revenue that the business in question filed its February 2020 payroll submission on 20 March 2020, which was outside of the 15 March deadline specified in the legislation, thereby preventing initial access to the TWSS. However, the business does have access under the revised ‘before’ 1 April concessionary arrangements and is receiving subsidy payments. ",

        "answerText": " Minister for Education and Skills  My Department has published details of a summer programme for children with special educational needs enrolled in special schools, special classes and mainstream classes. The programme incorporates some aspects of the July Provision of previous years.  Summer Provision 2020 – Reconnecting with Education , is a significantly expanded programme for children with complex special educational needs which aims to re-establish the child’s relationships and connection with school and their peers as a basis for learning and participation and to help the child to re-engage in learning and social activities and help them adapt to new routines and changes. The programme aims to ensure, in so far as possible, that the child can reintegrate/transition into their planned education setting for the next school year with their peers. In-school or home-based supports by teachers and SNAs will help to prevent regression among children with special needs.  The eligibility criteria has been widened to include the following categories of children:  1. Pupils with a diagnosis of Autism  2. Pupils with severe and profound learning difficulties  3. Any child in a special class or special school   4. Children transitioning into a special class or special school from early year’s settings  5. Pupils in primary school mainstream classes who present with the following disabilities:  - Children with Down syndrome  - Children who are Deaf or most severe hard of hearing  - Children who are blind or have a most severe visual impairment  - Children who have a moderate general learning disability  - Children with severe emotional behavioural difficulties  All special schools and primary schools with special classes are invited to provide the school based summer provision for their students. This programme will run for a minimum of two weeks and can extend up to four weeks where the schools, teachers and Special Needs Assistants are willing to participate.  Home-based provision will be available where a child’s local school is not providing a programme or does not have the capacity to accommodate a child in a planned programme this year. In this situation my Department will provide grant funding towards the engagement by Parents of a registered teacher / SNA to provide home based support for 10 hours a week for 4 weeks.  The programme will be reliant on schools, teachers and Special Needs Assistants (SNAs) choosing to participate on a voluntary basis.  A dedicated online registration system for families of children with special needs to access Summer Provision is now available on Gov.ie/summerprovision.  Parents are asked to register their participation online, providing some outline information of the extent of their participation in the programme e.g. number of weeks.  Once registered, the parent is then free to plan and organise the programme for their child by consulting with the child’s school and securing the services of a teacher or SNA.  I also announced a programme for DEIS schools for this Summer.  Full information on summer provision and its various strands, including guidance information for parents, is available at Gov.ie/summerprovision.  In relation to the query specifically referenced by the Deputy preschool age children covered by the scheme are those transitioning into a special class or special school from early year’s settings.

The Calculated Grades Student Portal will reopen in the coming weeks at which point students will be asked to opt in to receive calculated grades.  I want to thank the almost 99% of students who have registered to date and assure the Deputy that the Calculated Grades Executive Office continues to attempt to engage with those students yet to register.

        "answerText": " Minister for Education and Skills  I am aware of the challenges that are being encountered in the English language education sector and the substantial impact that the Covid-19 outbreak has had on its students, teachers and providers.  My Department has been engaging with representatives of English language education providers across a range of issues over the course of the Covid-19 outbreak to date. These engagements have included preliminary discussions and information exchanges surrounding the reopening of this sector.  The timeline and arrangements for the safe re-opening of English language education providers will be guided by public health advice applicable at a given time. The Government's roadmap for the gradual lifting of the current Covid-19 restrictions has set out a number of phases with the re-opening of the wider education system contained in the later phases to coincide broadly with the beginning of the new academic year.  While my Department will not be issuing guidelines specifically for the re-opening of the English language education sector, guidance to assist the tertiary education sector more generally in planning for reopening is being prepared at present and will be available shortly. My Department will further engage with provider representatives within the English language education sector as they develop more detailed plans for the re-opening of their premises. It is to be expected that ensuring the health and safety of staff and students will be central to the provider's plans and that necessary consultations will be undertaken as part of their development. It is anticipated that the \"Return to Work Safely Protocol\" recently published jointly by the Department of Health and the Department of Enterprise, Business & Innovation, and designed to support measures being put in place that will prevent the spread of COVID-19 in the workplace will be used to inform these plans, supplemented by any guidance issued by the Department for the tertiary education sector. This protocol envisions close engagement between staff and their employers during the planning, development and implementation of these new workplace measures. The experience of the re-opening of educational facilities in other areas and jurisdictions will also be relevant as part of this process. ",

Schools were informed that HEAnet would operate an aggregated order process on its Single Provider Framework with Dell, while Datapac would also do so through a Single Provider Framework with HP. Both of these Frameworks have been established from the OGP Framework of Providers of Laptops.  This was intended to enable laptop orders from schools to be prioritised, given current supply chain issues in the market. Schools are not obliged to use these mechanisms, they are intended to support those schools who determine laptops are required for their circumstances at this time.  These mechanisms are managed and operated by HEAnet and Datapac respectively, and as such, my Department does not have access to or responsibility for the data requested. ",

        "answerText": " Minister for Education and Skills  I propose to take Questions Nos. 154 and 169 together.  The Teaching Council is the statutory body with responsibility for professional standards at all stages of the teaching career. It has established standards for post-qualification professional practice, as set out in Droichead, the integrated professional induction framework for newly qualified primary and post-primary teachers.  Due to Covid-19 and the unprecedented situation of school closures, the Teaching Council has announced revised arrangements which provide additional flexibility to support newly qualified teachers (NQTs) engaging in Droichead in 2019/2020 to complete the process. These arrangements balance the core principles of the policy which is the school based supportive process coupled with engagement in additional professional learning activities.  The Council has made a significant concession for NQTs who had not completed the full Droichead process within the minimum period of time by 12 March. This includes the recognition of all elements of Droichead which have been completed up to that date i.e. additional professional learning activities, observations, professional conversations, cluster meetings, Taisce (the professional learning portfolio) and days/hours taught. In normal circumstances this would not be the position.  The Council has also clarified that any time spent engaging in Droichead after 12 March can be included in verification of the Droichead process. This includes remote teaching and learning, professional discussions and online observations.  Droichead as a process is not simply about teaching time. From a professional standards point of view, it requires the agreement of the NQT and the Professional Support Team in the school that a quality induction process has occurred over the minimum period of time specified.  While I understand that the Council has communicated with all NQTs and schools affected, further details of the revised arrangements can be found at www.teachingcouncil.ie ",

As the Deputy is aware, it is envisaged that this model will then provide the basis for development of a DEIS resource allocation system to match resources to identified need and I am confident the culmination of this work will allow us to target extra resources at those schools most in need.

        "answerText": " Minister for Education and Skills  The Programme for Access to Higher Education (PATH) fund was established to support innovative measures to deliver goals, objectives and targets in the National Plan for Equity of Access to Higher Education 2015-2021 (NAP). Strand 1 supports the objective to increase access to initial teacher education for students from the target groups identified in NAP including students from socio-economically disadvantaged backgrounds, members of the Irish Traveller Community, students entering on the basis of a further education award, students with a disability and mature students. NAP sub-groups include lone parents and ethnic minorities. Funding of €2.7m over three years was initially announced in 2016 . The Fund supports new initiatives to support entry into initial teaching for NAP target groups. This Fund was allocated on a competitive basis to the Centres for Teaching Excellence.  Following a report by the Higher Education Authority on the assessment of the Early Stage Implementation, an announcement was made in April 2020, that PATH 1 funding will continue for a further three years into 2022/2023 academic year bringing the total funding for this initiative to €5.4m over a six year period.  In addition to PATH 1 the Migrant Teacher Project (MTP), based in Marino Institute of Education, was established in 2017 to support the participation of immigrant internationally educated teachers in the Irish primary and post-primary education sectors. The MTP is co-funded by my Department and the Department of Justice and Equality through the Office for the Promotion of Migrant Integration's National Funding Programme 2022.  The project provides information, advice and training to teachers who have qualified outside of Ireland, to help them to continue their profession in Irish primary and post-primary schools. It aims to work with immigrant teachers to support them through the process of registration with the Teaching Council and seeking employment.  The MTP’s bridging programme ran for the first time from January until May 2019 with approx. forty primary and post-primary teachers from 18 different countries participating free of charge. The second cohort of 40 participants are expected to graduate in July of this year. Over 900 teachers from 70 countries have registered their interest with the project.  As part of my Department’s ongoing promotion of the teaching profession to support teacher supply, consideration is being given as to how to promote teaching as a career amongst those who are underrepresented in the sector, including the target groups identified under PATH 1 as well as migrant communities.

        "answerText": " Minister for Education and Skills  Under my Department’s free fees schemes, the Exchequer provides funding toward the tuition fee costs of eligible undergraduate students with students paying the student contribution which stands at €3,000 since 2014/2015. It is important to recognise that the Exchequer pays this contribution (or part of it) on behalf of almost 50% of undergraduate students as part of the student support grant.  The projected financial impact of Covid19 on Higher Education and the Tertiary Education system as a whole is being assessed by the Department of Education and Skills as part of its ongoing analysis of the impact of Covid19 on the education sector overall. The provision of additional financial support to support Tertiary Education to ensure that it can contribute fully to economic recovery and to meeting priority skill needs will be examined in the context of overall expenditure management and budgetary policy. The Department will continue to engage with key stakeholders to safeguard the recovery of the tertiary education sector.  Where students do not meet the eligibility criteria of the Free Fees Initiative, for example full-time undergraduate students who do not qualify for the free tuition fees; fees for part-time undergraduates or; any post-graduate students, it is a matter for the higher education institution as an autonomous body to determine which fee rate is applicable for students.  Third level institutions are autonomous entities responsible for their own day-to-day operations, management and administration. Any determination as to the level of fees to be charged is a matter for them in light of their own particular conditions and circumstances, and there are no current plans for the Department to undertake a specific review in that regard.  However my Department is undertaking a comprehensive economic review currently which is progressing under the European Commission DG Reform’s Structural Reform Support Programme. This review is focussed on Increasing the Future Sustainability of Higher and Further Education Provision in Ireland. The review encompasses an assessment of the funding options for higher education included in the 2016 (Cassells) Report of the Expert Group on Future Funding of Higher Education which includes the student contribution charge. The study is scheduled to be substantially complete in Q4 2020. ",

        "answerText": " Minister for Health  I propose to take Questions Nos. 388 and 390 together.  As the Deputy is aware, the Government confirmed the move to Phase 2 of Roadmap for Reopening Society & Business from Monday, 8 June 2020. Information and advice about the restrictions that have been eased as part of Phase 2 and the measures that are now in place are available on the Government website at http://www.gov.ie/phase2.  The Government also agreed to bring forward actions in the remaining phases of the Roadmap and plan for four phases rather than the five originally indicated. On 19 June 2020, the Taoiseach, on behalf of the Government, announced the restrictions that would be eased and the measures that will be in place when Phase 3 is introduced on 29 June 2020. This will be subject to continued progressive improvements in the health indicators identified in the Framework for Future Decision-Making described in the Roadmap.  The Deputy may wish to note that pubs and hotel bars operating as restaurants are included in these measures. It is important to note that pubs not operating as restaurants can only re-open when it is permitted to do so. All pubs, including those that serve food other than drinks, are required to be registered with the Health Service Executive in accordance with Regulation (EC) No 852/2004. All food businesses must also have a food safety management system in place based on the principles of Hazard (Analysis & Critical Control Point (HACCP) to control the risks in their food business.  Further information on these and other businesses food safety management systems has been published by the Food Safety Authority of Ireland and is available at https://www.fsai.ie/faq/coronavirus.html.  The Deputy may also wish to note that in preparing to re-open as per the Government announcement, the hospitality sector, as applicable, should refer to the HPSC COVID-19: Guidance for Food Service Businesses to assist them to carry out a detailed risk assessment and ensure that the communal spaces of venues, amenities and activities operate in line with physical distancing and the mass gatherings restrictions applying in Phase 3 and Phase 4.  Fáilte Ireland has also published updated guidelines for the re-opening of Restaurants and Cafés available at the following link: https://failtecdn.azureedge.net/failteireland/Guidelines-for-Re-opening-Restaurants-and-Cafes.pdf These guidelines are underpinned by advice made available from the HSA, HSE, HPSC, FSAI, World Health Organisation (WHO) and other relevant bodies.  In addition, on 9 May the “Return to Work Safely Protocol - COVID-19 Specific National Protocol for Employers and Workers” was published. It provides clear guidance to employers and to workers on the measures that must be taken to prevent the spread of COVID-19 in the workplace. The Protocol was developed through the cooperation of the Health and Safety Authority, the Department of Business, Enterprise and Innovation, the HSE and my Department. It is designed to be used by all workplaces to adapt their procedures and practices to provide protection against the threat of COVID-19.  Further information on the easing of restrictions as part of Phase 3 is available at the following link: https://www.gov.ie/en/publication/d06271-easing-the-covid-19-restrictions-on-29-june-phase-3/ ",

        "answerText": " Minister of State at the Department of Health (Finian McGrath)  Following extensive engagement between my Department, the Department of Education & Skills and the HSE a cross sectoral summer programme for children with complex needs and children in DEIS schools was announced on 12th June.  The Summer Provision 2020 will involve a number of strands with a range of options available for families and schools. These will include;  - A school based or home based programme provided by teachers and Special Needs Assistants, similar to the normal Department of Education and Skills July Provision Programme but with wider eligibility;  - A summer camp type programme for DEIS schools;  - And a HSE led, activity based respite / summer camp programme for prioritised children with complex needs.  The Department of Education and Skills have invited schools to express their interest in participating in the various programmes. Depending on the availability of school premises and Special Needs Assistants, the HSE and its children’s disability service providers will aim to provide a “summer camp” type programme in each community healthcare network.  Under this programme it is proposed that  - Respite sessions for a child will be limited to 3 hours;  - Each centre will accommodate a maximum of 16 children at any time;  - Each classroom will accommodate a maximum of 4 children at any time;  - Drop off and collection of children would be staggered over a 30-minute period.  It is intended that staff in children’s disability services will provide direction and support for Special Needs Assistants to deliver the programme. The input of these teams will ensure that the activities are tailored to the needs of the children.  The ultimate goals of the Summer Camp Programme are to:  - Provide short respite breaks for families;  - Facilitate children with complex needs to begin the transition from their homes to re-engaging with their communities and schools;  - Provide safe opportunities for children with complex needs to engage with their peers.  I trust that this clarifies the position for the Deputy. ",

        "answerText": " Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection  I propose to take Questions Nos. 787 and 827 to 829, inclusive, together.  The back to education allowance (BTEA) provides income support for jobseekers and others in receipt of certain social welfare payments that pursue courses of education at second or third level. The main focus of the BTEA is to assist qualifying applicants to improve their educational qualifications and improve their prospects of gaining employment.  In June 2020 there were approximately 6,300 students in receipt of the BTEA. Applications for BTEA are accepted throughout the year, however they tend to coincide with the commencement of the academic year. The vast majority of applications are received during August and September each year.  It is expected that, during the course of the accelerated Roadmap to recovery, as many people as possible in receipt of the Covid-19 pandemic unemployment payment will return to employment prior to the commencement of the 2020/21 academic year. At the point of commencement of a new course of education a person previously in receipt of this payment will be required to establish an entitlement to a Jobseekers payment to qualify for the BTEA .  A potential BTEA customer will not be adversely effected by time spent in receipt of the Covid-19 pandemic unemployment payment when it comes to calculating the qualifying period for BTEA.  The conditions under which the BTEA operate are designed to ensure that they address the objective of supporting longer term social welfare customers into employment. Any changes to the BTEA qualifying payments criteria would need to be considered in the overall policy and budgetary context. The Student Universal Support Ireland (SUSI) grant payable by the Department of Education and Skills represents the primary support for persons pursuing education.  I trust this clarifies the matter.

        "answerText": " Minister for Education and Skills  My Department has published details of a summer programme for children with special educational needs enrolled in special schools, special classes and mainstream classes. The programme incorporates some aspects of the July Provision of previous years.  Summer Provision 2020 – Reconnecting with Education, is a significantly expanded programme for children with complex special educational needs which aims to re-establish the child’s relationships and connection with school and their peers as a basis for learning and participation and to help the child to re-engage in learning and social activities and help them adapt to new routines and changes. The programme aims to ensure, in so far as possible, that the child can reintegrate/transition into their planned education setting for the next school year with their peers. In-school or home-based supports by teachers and SNAs will help to prevent regression among children with special needs.  The eligibility criteria has been widened to include the following categories of children:  1. Pupils with a diagnosis of Autism  2. Pupils with severe and profound learning difficulties  3. Any child in a special class or special school  4. Children transitioning into a special class or special school from early year’s settings  5. Pupils in primary school mainstream classes who present with the following disabilities:  - Children with Down syndrome  - Children who are Deaf or most severe hard of hearing  - Children who are blind or have a most severe visual impairment  - Children who have a moderate general learning disability  - Children with severe emotional behavioural difficulties  All special schools and primary schools with special classes are invited to provide the school based summer provision for their students. This programme will run for a minimum of two weeks and can extend up to four weeks where the schools, teachers and Special Needs Assistants are willing to participate.  Home-based provision will be available where a child’s local school is not providing a programme or does not have the capacity to accommodate a child in a planned programme this year. In this situation my Department will provide grant funding towards the engagement by Parents of a registered teacher/SNA to provide home based support for 10 hours a week for 4 weeks.  The programme will be reliant on schools, teachers and Special Needs Assistants (SNAs) choosing to participate on a voluntary basis.  A dedicated online registration system for families of children with special needs to access Summer Provision is now available on Gov.ie/summerprovision.  Parents are asked to register their participation online, providing some outline information of the extent of their participation in the programme e.g. number of weeks.  Once registered, the parent is then free to plan and organise the programme for their child by consulting with the child’s school and securing the services of a teacher or SNA.  I also announced a programme for DEIS schools for this Summer.  Full information on summer provision and its various strands, including guidance information for parents, is available at Gov.ie/summerprovision. ",

Deputy Thomas Byrne asked the Minister for Education and Skills the estimated loss in funding for higher education institutions, research funding through institutions and loss in income from student accommodation likely in 2020 and 2021 for universities, institutes of technology, further education colleges and English language schools; and if he will make a statement on the matter. [10649/20] ",
        "answerText": " Minister for Education and Skills  As part of the collaborative response to this pandemic with key tertiary education stakeholders, the Department has established working groups composed of experts to assess and respond to the impacts of Covid 19 across the Sector. These working groups members are reviewing immediate operations, medium term contingency planning and the review of specific and acute needs within Tertiary Education as well as the English Language Education sector. This process continues to facilitate the provision of key information from stakeholders, that will inform immediate and medium term actions to respond to the rapidly changing circumstances.   Mitigating the impact for Higher Education Providers and safeguarding that capacity against the backdrop of the broader economic crisis is a priority. By ensuring that core provision is maintained and in particular by assessing the level of financial vulnerability that may threaten the viability of any specific institution, the Department, the HEA and representative bodies can work together to respond to this crisis.  As part of the assessment of the financial impact on the HE sector, significant work has been undertaken by the stakeholder group chaired by the Higher Education Authority in consultation with the IUA and other representative bodies to collect information on the increased costs and projected income losses advised by HEIs arising from the crisis, based on an agreed set of assumptions.  In order to mitigate the risk for the viability of individual institutions, my Department is engaging closely with the HEA to provide specific and granular institutional-level detail essential to assess the risk of institutional failure as a means to safeguard future recovery for the sector as a whole. Following consultation with higher education providers and representative bodies, the HEA has now completed a template of required detail and has submitted this very recently to my Department. My officials will now consider and analyse the data provided.  Further Education and Training Institutes are funded from the Exchequer and National Training Fund and do not have private income from sources such as student accommodation, therefore a significant loss of income is not estimated within this sector.  Furthermore my Department has met with the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform to discuss the potential impact of COVID on the Tertiary Education Sector and the issue has also been highlighted at Government.  The Tertiary Education sector is a key element of the economy’s economic and social infrastructure which also has a crucial role in supporting economic and social recovery. The provision of additional financial support to support Tertiary Education to ensure that it can contribute fully to economic recovery and to meeting priority skill needs will be examined in the context of overall expenditure management and budgetary policy in the forthcoming period and also in light of the future Programme for Government priorities and commitments.  Responsibility for national Research, Development and Innovation (RDI) policy and for the primary competitive funding streams for public investment in research in higher education research resides with the Department of Business Enterprise and Innovation (DBEI). I understand that there is continuing positive engagement between all of the key research funding bodies and the representative bodies for the Higher Education sector. Consistent with similar approaches being adopted by the EU and many other international funders, flexibility is being offered in terms of considering proposals to reallocate costs within project awards, the provision of extensions for those directly impacted in terms of access to labs at this time and the possibility to review work packages within individual awards. The research funding bodies have published FAQ documents linked to the specifics of their own programmes, which provide further detail on the flexibility that they will offer to grant holders at this time. Furthermore, steps being taken under the Government’s Roadmap for Re-opening Society and Business should play an important role in reversing the business disruption experienced in research activities.  It is difficult to predict the demand for student accommodation for the next academic year, and therefore difficult to predict the loss of income from student accommodation which may be faced by third level institutions. Much depends on unfolding events such as all available national and international public health advice, particularly in respect of the extent to which students will be physically present in their institutions. My Department will continue to monitor the situation closely and any loss of income from student accommodation will form part of the overall financial context in which the provision of additional financial support to the third-level education system will be examined.  The vast majority of provision in the English language education (ELE) sector is undertaken by private companies and my Department would not have figures available for ELE schools. However officials are actively engaging with ELE providers and representatives through the Covid Response Working Group to identify and mitigate issues which have arisen as a result of the pandemic.  My Department will continue to engage actively with all key stakeholders to ensure the innovation and sustainable operation of the tertiary education system is safeguarded in light of its importance for the recovery of the economy overall.

        "answerText": " Minister for Education and Skills  I am aware of the challenges that are being encountered in the English language education sector and the substantial impact that the Covid-19 outbreak has had on students, teachers and providers in this sector.  The timeline and arrangements for the safe re-opening of English language education providers will be guided by public health advice applicable at a given time. The roadmap for the gradual lifting of the current Covid-19 restrictions has set out a number of phases with the re-opening of the wider education system contained in the later phases to coincide broadly with the beginning of the new academic year.  While my Department will not be issuing guidelines specifically for the re-opening of the English language education sector, guidance to assist the tertiary education sector more generally in planning for reopening is being prepared at present and will be available shortly. My Department will engage with provider representatives within the English language education sector as they develop more detailed plans for the re-opening of their premises on this basis. It is to be expected that ensuring the health and safety of staff and students will be central to the provider's plans and that necessary consultations will be undertaken as part of their development. It is anticipated that the \"Return to Work Safely Protocol\" recently published jointly by the Department of Health and the Department of Enterprise, Business & Innovation, and designed to support measures being put in place that will prevent the spread of COVID-19 in the workplace will be used to inform these plans, supplemented by any guidance issued by the Department for the tertiary sector. The protocol envisions close engagement between staff and their employers during the planning, development and implementation of these new workplace measures. The experience of the re-opening of educational facilities in other areas and jurisdictions will also be relevant.  My Department is also engaging with learner advocates as part of efforts to address student issues in this sector. This engagement will continue and my Department will keep the advocates informed of developments for the planned reopening of this sector. ",
