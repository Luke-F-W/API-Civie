        "answerText": " Minister for Transport  The improvement and maintenance of regional and local roads is the statutory responsibility of each local authority, in accordance with the provisions of Section 13 of the Roads Act 1993. Works on those roads are funded from Councils' own resources, which are supplemented by State grants for regional and local roads.  On 14th February 2025 I announced an Exchequer investment of €713 million for our regional and local roads across the State which represents an overall increase of over 8% in funding this year. The main focus of the grants continues to be the protection and renewal of the regional and local road network.  As regards the basis for allocating grants, within the budget available for the regional and local road grant programme, the Department's grant funding for the maintenance of regional and local roads is allocated on as fair and equitable a basis as possible to eligible local authorities. In this context, grants in the main grant categories are allocated based on the length of the road network within a local authority's area of responsibility with some account taken of traffic. It is envisaged that grants will continue to be made available on that basis.  Basing regional and local roads grant allocations on road conditions could result in an unequitable distribution of Exchequer funding. For example, local authorities that allocate higher levels of own resources funding to regional and local roads will have a larger proportion of roads with a higher condition rating than those with lower levels of own resources funding. Basing allocations on road condition could therefore disincentivise local authorities from allocating own resources funding to roads maintenance.  The Department appreciates that, within the overall parameters set for the grant programme, local authorities might need to target funding at particular problem areas and there is sufficient flexibility in the structure of the grant programme to allow for this. It is also open to each local authority to allocate its own resources to priority areas.  It should be noted that Exchequer funding for regional and local roads is intended to supplement realistic contributions from local authorities’ own resources. As the statutory road authorities for their areas, it is open to local authorities to prioritise investment on regional and local roads. ",

        "answerText": " Minister for Enterprise, Tourism and Employment  Regional development is a key focus of our Programme for Government and is central to the work of my Department and our Agencies. At the outset, I should clarify that regional tourism promotion is an operational matter for Fáilte Ireland, in collaboration with Local Authorities and other tourism stakeholders, and that Fáilte Ireland do not allocate its marketing spend on a county-by-county basis.  The Programme for Government provides that this Government will work with Fáilte Ireland to develop a balanced regional spread of tourism throughout the country, promoting and enhancing the Hidden Heartlands, Ireland's Ancient East, the Wild Atlantic Way and Dublin. Fáilte Ireland has established localised Destination Experience Development Plans (DEDPs) to activate these brands.  Wexford is included in Fáilte Ireland’s “Ireland’s Ancient East” Regional Tourism Development Strategy 2023 – 2027. The Wexford Destination and Experience Development Plan (DEDP) which was launched earlier this year by Fáilte Ireland, aims to create a sustainable tourism destination by extending the tourism season and spreading business across all parts of the region over the next five years. The DEDP integrates both existing and new projects throughout the county, while also exploring new tourism development opportunities to enhance the value of the tourism sector in County Wexford. The strategy emphasises the need for greater connectivity among Wexford’s coastal, rural, and urban experiences to boost the county's appeal to international visitors. The DEDP has been developed through a collaborative approach and will be dependent on local tourism businesses, stakeholders and local communities working with Fáilte Ireland to implement this plan over next five years.  As part of Fáilte Ireland’s sponsorship of the RTÉ weather, a dedicated sting for Wexford is included in the annual rotation and runs for a 2-week period reaching on average 1.6 million people per week on average 8 times during 2025. This is supported with complementary messaging across RTÉ Player and RTE.ie. Tourism Ireland also regularly highlights Wexford to their 7.4 million followers on social media, sharing compelling content (stunning images and video) on platforms including Instagram, Facebook and TikTok.  Tourism Ireland, in conjunction with Fáilte Ireland, undertakes a programme of fact-finding visits for tour operators and travel agents from our key markets, so that they can experience the superb tourism product in Wexford. In September, fourteen Italian travel agents visited Ireland’s Ancient East, including County Wexford. Their itinerary included the Dunbrody Famine Ship and The Irish National Heritage Park. In May, twenty-four Spanish travel agents visited Ireland’s Ancient East, including Wells House near Kilmuckridge.  In 2024, the Dunbrody Famine Ship visitor experience in New Ross, Co. Wexford was officially opened following an investment of €1.6million which was part-funded by Fáilte Ireland.  Finally, Government funding has supported Fáilte Ireland’s ‘Platforms For Growth 2’ programme and 19 best-in-class water-sports facilities will be built across the country to help extend the outdoor tourism season by providing year-round hot showers, changing rooms, toilets, secure storage, induction spaces, and equipment washdown areas. I was delighted to open the first of these new facilities in August in Curracloe, County Wexford. ",

This particular competition was managed under the Guidelines for Appointments not under the remit of the Public Service Management (Recruitment and Appointments) Act 2004, setting out the principles under which the appointment will be made and the appeals process for candidates. These Guidelines set out the framework for such recruitment, selection and appointment processes and centres on the five recruitment principles that have been set out in the Codes of Practice prepared by the CPSA for appointment to positions falling under the remit of the Act. The Guidelines are generally based on the CPSA Codes of Practice thereby ensuring that a consistent approach to recruitment is adopted in all campaigns conducted by publicjobs.

Driver licensing laws are intended to ensure drivers on our roads meet high safety standards.  There are various reasons for timelines in relation to processing Non-EU licence exchanges, for example, the driver may need to submit outstanding information, such as, a medical or eyesight report, or the physical driving licence itself in the case of an online application. The most common reason for delays is the NDLS awaiting verification of the driving licence from the foreign driving licence authority. At times a response is received very quickly but sometimes there can be considerable delays.  Vigilance is needed when processing a foreign licence for exchange to ensure a fraudulent document has not been submitted and to ensure a driving test was passed in the foreign country in which the licence was obtained. Road safety and keeping Irish roads safe for all road users remains the priority in this matter.  My Department does not have access to individual driving licence applications and may not intervene in the licence application process.  All enquiries relating to driver licensing are handled by the National Driver Licence Service (NDLS), the provision of which I have delegated under national legislation to the Road Safety Authority (RSA).

The FDI performance in the region has been strong over the past five years with employment among IDA clients increasing by 15%. The South-East has a significant ecosystem of well-established companies across Technology, Life Sciences, International Financial Services and Engineering & Industrial Technologies which are complemented by research centres that help win new business and assist existing client companies with transformation. Counties in the South-East also benefit from direct and indirect ‘remote’ and ‘hybrid’ employment generated by IDA client companies located in Dublin.  IDA Ireland continues to deliver a competitive property offering to attract FDI and support the growth and expansion of domestic clients within the Enterprise Ireland portfolio and Local Enterprise Offices (LEO) clients. In that regard, I am advised that in terms of land holdings in County Wexford, the IDA currently owns 58 hectares of lands with approximately 4 hectares available for marketing across Wexford IDA Business & Technology Park, Wexford Business Park, and IDA Enniscorthy. IDA continues to work with regional stakeholders and the private sector on opportunities to add to the supply of competitive property solutions in the South-East Region. Under its current strategy IDA has committed to deliver an Advance Planning Permit in partnership with Wexford County Council for an Advanced Technology Building during the lifetime of the 2025-2029 Strategy.  Innovative, ambitious start-ups are the bedrock of the Irish economy and will form the foundations of future enterprise success. Enterprise Ireland, in partnership with the 31 LEOs and the wider enterprise and innovation ecosystem, aims to stimulate and foster the next generation of Irish enterprise successes by supporting ambitious start-ups to access finance, build capacity, and grow domestically and internationally. Enterprise Ireland is committed to supporting the attraction and development of employers in County Wexford and the wider South-East region through a range of targeted initiatives and national programmes.  In 2024, 5,943 people were employed across 130 Enterprise Ireland client companies in County Wexford, up from 5,776 in 2023, which represents an increase of 167 net jobs. In April 2025, EI client and global leader in the design and manufacture of medical device balloons, Hoop Medical, announced the official opening of its new, purpose-built facility in the Ardcavan Business Park, Wexford. This expansion supported by EI provides a 10,000-square-foot manufacturing space, more than tripling Hoop's current footprint to support the company’s continued growth and create new job opportunities.  Enterprise Ireland has also invested heavily in the B.A.S.S.E. accelerator programme, delivered by GreenTech HQ in Enniscorthy. This supports SMEs with mentoring, strategic planning, and access to entrepreneurial talent to drive sustainable growth, with the objective of creating up to 300 new jobs in scaling EI client companies. More broadly, under its new five-year strategy Delivering for Ireland, Leading Globally (2025–2029), Enterprise Ireland aims to support 1,000 new start-ups, 1,700 new exporters, and increase employment in supported companies to 275,000 nationwide.  Enterprise Ireland also provides direct supports to businesses seeking to establish or expand in Wexford, including Employment Funding grants, Market Discovery Funds to explore new markets, and Key Manager grants to attract senior talent. These supports are designed to help companies start, compete, scale, and connect—ensuring that Irish enterprises can thrive locally while growing globally. Enterprise Ireland works closely with regional stakeholders, including Wexford County Council and the Local Enterprise Office, to ensure a coordinated approach to enterprise development and job creation.  Enterprise Ireland is an active member of the South-East Regional Enterprise Plan process which has brought together stakeholders in the South-East to develop initiatives focused on driving enterprise growth in the region and continues to invest in supporting infrastructure, innovation hubs, and collaborative projects that strengthen regional enterprise ecosystems. The South-East REP covers Wexford, Waterford, Kilkenny and Carlow and aims to leverage the established strengths of the region in terms of ICT, life sciences, engineering and financial services and build capacity in emerging areas such as offshore energy. Some of the projects supported through the South-East REP include the Ireland South-East Offshore Wind Partnership, and the Business Advantage & Sustainability South-East (B.A.S.S.E) programme.  Based on all of the above, I have every confidence that Wexford and the South-East region will remain an attractive location for both foreign and domestic investment and continue to be a thriving entrepreneurial hotspot well into the future.

        "answerText": " Minister for Enterprise, Tourism and Employment  There has been a significant long-term shift in attitudes to remote work amongst both employers and workers throughout the country since the pandemic. Acceptance of remote and hybrid working is high, and the evidence suggests that they are here to stay.  Remote working represents a significant opportunity for creating a more inclusive labour market and enhanced access to high-quality employment opportunities for workers in their home communities. This in turn provides employers with access to a larger talent pool, with remote and flexible working options representing powerful tools for staff recruitment and retention which improves labour market performance and regional economic balance overall.  The most recent data from the Central Statistics Office show that in the second quarter of 2025, over 1 million persons reported working from home at least some of the time. Within this, over half a million (555,500) persons were usually working from home (relative to a peak number of 774,300 in 2021 Q2). In the South-East Region which includes County Wexford, 65,900 people were working from home (usually or sometimes) in the second quarter of 2025, down from a peak of 73,800 in 2022Q1.  The most recent labour force survey results also illustrate that our policies are working with record numbers of people in employment. Nationally, there were 2.8 million persons at work in the second quarter of the year, an annual gain of 63,900 jobs. Analysis undertaken by the Department of Finance in 2025 highlights not only the scale of Ireland’s employment growth since the pandemic, but also its spread, with job growth recorded in every region, including the South-East, which has seen employment increase by nearly 21% since just before the pandemic. Remote working has contributed to this regional job growth, by allowing people in places such as County Wexford to access employment in sectors amenable to remote working such as ICT.  Initiatives such as the Work Life Balance Act 2023, which establishes the right to request remote working for all workers, and the National Remote Work Strategy, reflect the Government’s commitment to facilitating these changes in a way which maximises their economic, social and environmental benefits. Development and delivery of the National Remote Strategy was overseen by the Remote Work Interdepartmental Group, based in my Department.  Programme for Government 2025, Securing Ireland’s Future , re-affirms this commitment to promoting flexible working arrangements that benefit both workers and employers.  In terms of Ireland’s evolving suite of policies and supports for remote working for employees and employers, I would highlight the following:  • The right to request a remote working arrangement for all employees was commenced through the Work Life Balance and Miscellaneous Provisions Act 2023 on 6 March 2024. Employers are obliged to have regard to the Code of Practice and the other requirements of the Act when considering requests for remote working. Employees have recourse to the Workplace Relations Commission if the employer fails to comply with the legislation. Providing a right to request supports and facilitating remote working in Ireland, and at the same time, supports a productive and competitive business environment.  • The legislation provides for a review of the operation of the remote working provisions of the Act, not earlier than one year and not later than two years after the commencement of the Act. There are also provisions to conduct a review of the operation of the flexible working provisions of the Act and, as part of the review, consider whether the right to request a flexible working arrangement should be extended to all employees. The Department of Enterprise, Tourism and Employment will be carrying out a review of the operation of the right to request remote working provisions of the Act by March 2026.  • The Code of Practice on the Right to Disconnect was introduced April 2021 by the Workplace Relations Commission, followed by the introduction of an enhanced income tax deduction amounting to 30 percent of heat, electricity and broadband expenses for people working from home, announced in Budget 2022.  • My Department continues to update its Guidance for Working Remotely webpage for employees and employers to support the safe and successful adoption of remote working practices. In addition, the Government co-funds remote work skills training programmes, such as Leading and Hybrid Remote Teams provided by Laois Offaly ETB and Grow Remote, and The FORWARD Programme which provides SMEs personalised support to design, implement, and sustain effective remote work practices.  • The Government's commitment to promoting remote work is also evident through initiatives like the National Hub Network, facilitated by Connected Hubs. This initiative plays a vital role in supporting the National Remote Work Strategy by providing accessible, well-equipped remote working spaces throughout Ireland. With 393 hubs across the country, and plans to expand to 400 by the end of 2025, Connected Hubs is helping to build vibrant local economies, revitalising communities and offering diverse services to remote workers, SMEs, and start-ups. These hubs are essential in enhancing labour market participation and promoting sustainable, flexible work options in line with Government policy. 13 of these hubs are located in County Wexford.  • The Connected Hubs network is a key driver in Ireland’s push to support remote work and regional development. Aligned with policies like Our Rural Future and the forthcoming National Hub Strategy, the initiative empowers individuals to work remotely while staying rooted in their communities. Hubs provide essential infrastructure and services, from co-working spaces and conference facilities to specialist resources like podcast studios and maker spaces. Beyond workspace provision, they offer vital business supports such as mentoring, start-up accelerators, and sector-specific programmes. By promoting innovation and collaboration, Connected Hubs is shaping the future of work while contributing to balanced regional growth and sustainable development across Ireland.  • A national marketing campaign – In Good Company – is being launched in October 2025 to encourage SMEs to adopt flexible hub-based working models. The 2025 National Hub Summit, taking place in November, will bring together all relevant parties from across government, enterprise, community development and the hub ecosystem.  • Ireland's Digital Connectivity Strategy sets ambitious targets for the continued development of the digital infrastructure which enables successful remote working in Ireland. These targets include providing a Gigabit network to all households and businesses in Ireland by 2028 and access to 5G in all populated areas by 2030. The Programme for Government sets a number of targets which include the completion of the installation of high-speed fibre broadband to 1.1 million people, including homes, farms, and businesses nationwide, by 2026.  The Government continues to monitor the impacts of new ways of working. For example, the Department of Enterprise, Tourism and Employment is co-funding to the Working in Ireland Survey which is currently being carried out by University College Dublin. This is the second iteration of the Survey, first undertaken in 2021, and aims to interview several thousand persons across Ireland about their experiences of working life - including remote working. This work is underway with the main outputs from the survey expected in 2026. In addition, the Department of Taoiseach has requested that the National Economic and Social Council (NESC) undertake research into the Evolution and Impact of Remote and Hybrid Working in Ireland. A working group has been established to oversee the research, which is expected be completed by mid-2026. This research will inform wider debates around remote working policy.  Future trends in relation to remote and flexible working will be influenced by many factors, including the preferences of employers and employees, labour market conditions and the evolution of Ireland’s enterprise base. However, it is likely that remote work -underpinned by Government policy and investment – will continue to be a significant driver of job growth in communities across Ireland. ",

Eligible children who complete the application process and pay or enter their medical card details on time will get a seat on a school bus service, if a service is available.  Children who are not eligible but who apply for school transport are considered for spare seats that may exist after eligible children have been facilitated; such seats are referred to as concessionary seats.  Because of the nature of concessionary transport for non-eligible children and the priority of providing places for eligible children, there may be an excess of demand over supply for concessionary places. In these cases Bus Éireann will allocate tickets for spare seats using an agreed selection process.  A minimum number of 10 eligible children residing in a distinct locality, as determined by Bus  Éireann, are required before consideration may be given to the establishment or retention of school transport services, provided this can be done within reasonable cost limits.

This was made up of 2,700 new places and 1,200 places through the natural movement of students from primary to post-primary or out of education.  The NCSE has advised my department just under 3,300 valid notifications were received by mid-February via their new parent notify service. While parents were asked to notify the NCSE by mid-February the NCSE received further notifications after this date. The NCSE advise that just over 700 special vacancies remain at national level in schools at the start of this school year and there are a number of vacancies remaining in every county in the country.  I urge any parent still seeking placement to make contact with the NCSE who will provide guidance and support with securing a placement.

The Vacant Homes Action Plan, published in January 2023, set out the various actions being taken to return vacant properties back into use as homes across the country, including Wexford. In March, I published the 2025 Progress Report which shows the significant progress that is being made and it is available on my Department's website at the following link: www.gov.ie/en/publication/df86c-vacant-homes-action-plan-2023-2026/.  One of the key measures in the Action Plan supporting the refurbishment of older, vacant and derelict buildings for housing is the Vacant Property Refurbishment Grant. The grant can provide up to €50,000 for the refurbishment of vacant properties for use as homes and up to €70,000 where the property is derelict.  To end of Q3 2025, in Wexford County Council, 525 applications for the Vacant Property Refurbishment Grant have been received, with 385 approvals and 117 grants paid, to a total value of €6.45 million.  The Programme for Government, \"Securing Ireland’s Future\", includes a range of commitments to continue our work in tackling vacancy and dereliction and supporting town centre living. These measures are currently being considered in the context of the forthcoming National Housing Plan.  I firmly believe that the commitment Government has made to addressing vacancy and dereliction and the actions taken will continue to play a vital role in delivering homes across the country. ",

As part of this engagement a preferred site was identified. However, following a lengthy negotiation process between WCC and the Vendor, agreement could not be reached on a price.  WCC are now progressing this acquisition by way of a compulsory purchase order (CPO) and discussions remain ongoing between the Vendor and WCC to agree the compensation sum. If agreement cannot be reached the matter may be referred by either party for arbitration to assess compensation. The next stage of the process is serving a “notice of entry” to enter on the lands, giving WCC the right to enter and take possession of the site.  SETU have also submitted a preliminary business case for the proposed infrastructure they would like to be delivered on the site. This business case will require to be considered in the context of the overall needs relating to learner demand and proposed campus faculties in the Wexford region. It is also worth noting that this business case cannot be finalised until the site has been secured as it is a key determinant in the assessment process.  As I have stated previously, I am committed to continue working with SETU and all relevant stakeholders to ensure that there is appropriate infrastructure in place for learners and staff in Wexford and surrounding regions.

        "answerText": " Minister of State at the Department of Public Expenditure, Infrastructure, Public Service Reform and Digitalisation  In March 2020, the Commissioners of Public Works in Ireland submitted the Enniscorthy Food Relief Scheme to the then Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform for statutory confirmation, under the provisions of the Arterial Drainage Acts 1945 and 1995. The main elements of the proposed Scheme included construction of flood defence walls, river channel widening and deepening, and removal of the Seamus Rafter Bridge with construction of new and replacement road and pedestrian bridges over the River Slaney. In March 2022, the Minister made a decision to refuse this Scheme due primarily to concerns on the impact of the Scheme on the environment and protected species including the freshwater pearl mussel.  Since March 2022 there has been extensive engagement between the OPW and Wexford County Council, who are the contracting authority for the Scheme. In Q4 2023, Wexford County Council submitted a proposed strategy for the progression of the Scheme to the OPW. The proposed strategy, which was approved by the OPW, comprises two phases for the delivery of the Scheme (i.e. Phase 1 Bridgeworks and Phase 2 Flood Relief Works).  Phase 1 of the Scheme will include the construction of the new River Slaney Bridge, the construction of a new pedestrian bridge and the removal of the Seamus Rafter Bridge, which poses an obstruction to river flow through the town centre during flood events. Phase 2 of the Scheme will include the construction of the remaining flood relief measures for Enniscorthy town.  The Project Steering Group is currently progressing design options for Phase I. An initial Public Consultation on Phase 1 took place in Q2 2025 to present emerging options to the public. A second Public Consultation is due to take place in Q4 2025 to present the preferred option to the public and stakeholders and to gather any relevant feedback.  To assist with a planning application submission to An Coimisiún Pleanála (ACP), relevant environmental surveys are currently being updated and an Environmental Impact Assessment Report (EIAR) and Natura Impact Statement (NIS) will be prepared. It is envisaged that a planning application will be submitted to An Coimisiún Pleanála (ACP) in Q3 2026.  Prior to lodging a planning application with ACP a Maritime Area Consent (MAC) application will be required from the Maritime Area Regulatory Authority (MARA). Consultations with MARA will commence when sufficient detailed design has progressed.  With regards to Phase 2, Wexford County Council and the OPW are currently finalising a Project Brief in order to issue a tender for the appointment of a consultant and it is expected to go to tender in Q4 2025. It is envisaged a consultant will be appointed in Q1 2026. A detailed Programme for the overall Scheme (Phase 1 & Phase 2) will be subsequently developed for the Scheme following the appointment of a consultant for Phase 2.  The OPW and Wexford County Council remain committed to the progression of this Scheme, which currently has an approved total project budget of approximately €51m for flood relief measures, which will be funded under the Government’s €1.3bn for flood relief measures under the National Development Plan.

        "answerText": " Minister of State at the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage  The 2016 geophysical survey results referred to identified three discrete pits which have been interpreted by those who carried out the survey as potentially representing mass graves associated with the 1798 battle. As no intrusive archaeological investigations have been carried out in this area, this interpretation remains conjectural.  The National Monuments Service of my Department has commissioned a wide ranging and detailed study of historic battlefields up to and including those of the 1798 Rebellion, known as the Irish Battlefields Project. Substantial progress is being made towards formal publication of the detailed results of that project and the resources being allocated towards their publication by the state reflects the appreciation that such places are an important part of our history and heritage.  In the interim, location points for a range of battlefields have been included on my Department’s online Historic Environment Viewer, and included in this is the Vinegar Hill Battlefield. While this does not of itself confer statutory protection on such battlefields, I am satisfied that a range of information is available to planning authorities so as to ensure that historic battlefields receive appropriate consideration in the statutory planning process, though it is of course a matter for each planning authority to adopt appropriate objectives in that regard under its statutory development plan.  Under the Historic and Archaeological Heritage and Miscellaneous Provisions Act 2023, it will be possible to give legal protection to battlefields and other sites of historic events by way of entering them, with an appropriate surrounding area, into the Register of Monuments to be established under that Act. This will be the case even in the absence of surviving or identifiable physical remains from the battle or event in question. My Department is working on the continuing commencement of the various provisions of the new legislation, so that the new Register can be established at the earliest possible date. Work is also in progress to implement the system of Prescribed Monuments under the new Act, to provide automatic protection for certain classes of monument without need for registration. Consideration is being given in that regard to including as classes of Prescribed Monuments the physical remains of military engagements, such as clusters of archaeological objects associated with such an engagement.  I believe that the implementation of this new legislation (which fundamentally modernises and strengthens the law on protection of archaeological heritage and monuments generally), combined with the detailed publication of the results of the Irish Battlefields Project and greater attention to the protection of battlefields in the planning process will present great opportunities to ensure that battlefield heritage is comprehensively protected in the future.  Annual archaeological research grants funded by my Department’s National Monuments Service are made available through the Royal Irish Academy: www.ria.ie/grants/archaeology-research-grants/. These research funding streams may be a source to pursue for those for those wishing to carry out further research on the archaeology of Vinegar Hill, subject of course to necessary permissions. ",

        "answerText": " Minister for Education and Youth  The Teaching Council registers teachers under the Teaching Council Act 2001-2015 and in line with the Teaching Council Registration Regulations, 2016. As set out in the Schedule of the Regulations, the Council registers teachers under five routes of registration: Route 1 - Primary, Route 2 - Post-primary, Route 3 - Further Education, Route 4 - Other and Route 5 - Student Teacher. The qualification requirements for each route are set down in the Schedule.  The qualifications of teachers who qualified outside of the Republic of Ireland are assessed on an individual and holistic basis for the purposes of registering as a teacher. Qualifications are assessed for comparability with graduates of initial teacher education programmes accredited by the Teaching Council. All applications from teachers who qualified abroad are processed in line with the EU Directive 2005/36/EC and are assessed in the same manner, regardless of whether they qualified within or outside the EU. The EU Directive provides for the assessment of qualifications for the purposes of recognition, and this recognition may be subject to conditions. The directive enables those teachers who are registered or certified to teach in the jurisdictions in which their qualifications are obtained to apply for registration in the State, however where such registration or certification includes a mandated period of induction or post-qualification practice under the directive this is a requirement of registration in the State.  To assist further with teacher supply challenges, I announced last April that I would work with the Teaching Council to introduce a proposal to enable eligible teachers who have qualified outside of Ireland to apply for registration and complete their induction requirement here.  I see this as an important step in encouraging more teachers to work and start their careers here in Ireland.  Under the Teaching Council Act, the Council makes regulations for the purposes of registration through statutory instrument, including to amend or replace existing regulations. A new set of registration regulations have been drafted which include the provision for induction in the state for teachers qualified outside of the state for a specified period of time. The making of such regulations are subject to certain requirements, including engaging with the Data Protection Commissioner in the context of data protection legislation. Statutory Instrument No 413/2022 - European Union (Regulated Professional Assessment) Regulations 2022 prescribes that a proportionality impact assessment be carried out on any regulations related to access regulated professions, so this was also undertaken on the draft registration regulations. The Teaching Council also undertook consultation with relevant education stakeholders as is the usual practice. Legal advice was also obtained. and all of those steps added to the time required, ensuring that the final draft regulations are proportional, with no legal impediments to the making of same.  It is expected that primary and post-primary teachers, who qualified outside of the Republic of Ireland and apply to complete their induction here under the new provision, will be subject to meeting eligibility and qualifications requirements prior to approval.  I am pleased to inform you that the final draft of the new Registration Regulations has been received from the Teaching Council and is progressing through the required procedures so that it can be laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas to be implemented shortly.  Please refer to the Teaching Council website, www.teachingcouncil.ie, for updates regarding the making of the new Registration Regulations, and for information on accessing the timebound provision for overseas qualified applicants to register and complete their induction in the State.

        "answerText": " Minister for Culture, Communications and Sport  I propose to take Questions Nos. 101 and 102 together.  The Programme for Government commits to assessing the Basic Income for the Arts pilot research scheme to maximise its impact. I appreciate the importance of the Basic Income support for artists, which is why last week I announced that Cabinet had agreed to my proposal to an extension of six months to allow for further evaluation of the pilot data. This will also give sufficient time to engage in stakeholder consultation and to evaluate the data which will provide the evidence base for Government to make decisions on the next steps.  The current scheme costs just under €35m per year to provide the payment to 2,000 recipients. The cost of the 6-month extension is €16.7m.

The Programme for Government commits to assessing the Basic Income for the Arts pilot research scheme to maximise its impact. I appreciate the importance of the Basic Income support for artists, which is why last week I announced that Cabinet had agreed to my proposal to an extension of six months to allow for further evaluation of the pilot data. This will also give sufficient time to engage in stakeholder consultation and to evaluate the data which will provide the evidence base for Government to make decisions on the next steps.  The current scheme costs just under €35m per year to provide the payment to 2,000 recipients. The cost of the 6-month extension is €16.7m. The net overall cost to of the pilot to the Exchequer is likely to be less given the high number of BIA recipients who were previously on social welfare supports prior to the BIA, and a Cost Benefit Analysis currently underway should bring further clarity to the overall costs.

The Government is very aware that small schools are an important part of the life of local communities.  The current small schools' action research project established in 2021 is due to conclude at the end of the next school year. The project has brought small schools together in local clusters, enabling them to collaborate, identify common challenges and trial innovative solutions.  It includes six clusters of small schools, two in Galway and one each in Donegal, Kerry, Wicklow and Waterford, consisting of between three and five schools per cluster. The feedback from schools has been extremely positive and this is reflected in the interim evaluation report recently published by my department.  The independent review identifies potential areas for closer collaboration and an analysis of the scalability of actions already undertaken. As the project progresses a further evaluation will take place.  Learnings from this evaluation of the current project will be invaluable and form a strong basis to inform the future policy direction in relation to all small schools, including how the Programme for Government commitment can be delivered.

This will build on the progress which has been made by the previous Government. The general average of pupils to teachers in the Primary Staffing Schedule improved from 26:1 five years ago to 23:1 for the current school year; the lowest ever ratio at primary level. Average class sizes in primary schools have improved from 24.1 to 22.5 in that time, while the ratio of pupils to teachers has improved from 15:1 to 12.8:1, through the investment we are making in schools.

The  retirement age for school bus drivers has been set by Bus Éireann at 70 years of age, which also applies to all Bus Éireann road passenger services.  The policy and criteria also apply to drivers nominated by private operators who operate services as part of the School Transport Scheme, provided they hold the requisite license and satisfy an annual medical examination until they retire at age 70.  The Road Safety Authority, under the remit of the Department of Transport, committed to reviewing the upper age limit of drivers as it relates to larger vehicles/school buses. This review is now complete.  Under the new Programme for Government (PFG), Government has committed to \"Carry out an independent assessment on the feasibility of removing the exclusion of drivers aged over 70 from the School Transport Scheme\".   The Department is engaging with the Department of Transport and with Bus Éireann on this matter. "

        "answerText": " Minister of State at the Department of Education and Youth  The school transport scheme is a demand led scheme based on the number of children who apply. The scheme is operated using a mix of Bus Éireann owned vehicles and directly recruited drivers, and private contractors who recruit their own drivers to operate on the scheme.  The Current eligibility criteria is as follows:  • Primary school: Children are eligible if they live 3.2 km or more from their nearest national school.  • Post-primary school: Children are eligible if they live 4.8 km or more from their nearest post-primary school or education centre.  • Distance is measured by Bus Éireann. The rules also take into account the language and ethos of the school.  If a child is eligible and the family applies and pays on time, they will be given a place on the school bus if:  • A service is running in their area  • There is space available  If a child is not eligible, but the family still applies and pays on time, they may be offered a spare seat if there is one. These are called concessionary seats.  However, because eligible children are given priority, there may not be enough spare seats for everyone who applies. In these cases, Bus Éireann will allocate tickets for spare seats using an agreed selection process  Temporary Alleviation measures will continue for the upcoming school year. If a child is eligible for transport to their nearest school, but is going to their second nearest school, they may still get transport as long as a service is running and there is space, and they apply and pay on time.  As part of the operation of the scheme, Bus Éireann manages the procurement tender process and contract management arrangements to include services provided by contractors under the School Transport Scheme. There are currently in the region of 8,000 vehicles operating on the scheme.  The competitive procurement process is conducted in accordance with the negotiated procedure under national and EU procurement legislation.  At the beginning of the current school year, Bus Éireann reported particular issues with availability of drivers and contractors. This included a number of contractors handing back contracts unexpectedly, and the receipt of zero bids for contracts tendered out in certain areas. This is against a backdrop of significant shortages of drivers in the labour market overall and competing demands for drivers to deliver additional public transport initiative.  Bus Éireann has frequent engagement with existing contractors. A national and local media advertising campaign seeking additional contractor operators for the Scheme is currently in place supported by additional targeted social media campaigns.  As part of a national focus on driver requirements, the Department has facilitated a working group between the Department of Education, Department of Transport, Bus Éireann and Education and Training Boards Ireland (ETBI) to increase the availability of drivers within both the school transport scheme and other public transport areas nationally, through existing and potential training schemes.  As a result of work undertaken by the working group, a transport taskforce has now been established which is chaired by the Department of Transport. The aim of the taskforce is to work collaboratively to identify contributing factors to the recruitment issues and put forward recommendations and measures to address these issues. "

        "answerText": " Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage  The provision of a fire service in its functional area, including the establishment and maintenance of a fire brigade, the assessment of fire cover needs and the provision of fire station premises, is a statutory function of individual fire authorities under the Fire Services Act 1981 & 2003. My Department supports the fire authorities through setting general policy, providing a central training programme, issuing guidance on operational and other related matters and providing capital funding for priority infrastructural projects.In December 2020, Minister Darragh O’Brien announced the Fire Services Capital Programme for the period 2021-2025, with a funding allocation of €61m. Following extensive engagement with fire authorities, a number of proposals for station works etc. were received. The proposals were evaluated and prioritised on the basis of the:  • Area Risk Categorisation of the fire station (population, fire risks, etc.);  • established Health and Safety needs;  • state of development of the project;  • value for money offered by the proposal; and  • the totality of requests from all authorities.  The 2021 - 2025 Programme was projected to see six new fire stations built, continued support for the construction of a further 12 new fire stations, nine fire station refurbishments as well as the allocation of 35 new fire appliances. Continued investment in the fire appliance fleet has been identified as a key national priority; that is why, in October 2023, then Minister O’Brien announced the allocation of an additional 40 new fire appliances at a cost of €20.8m.  Wexford County Council identified a new fire station at New Ross as their number one priority with refurbishment and upgrade works to Gorey Fire station identified as the second priority. Both proposals, New Ross and Gorey, prioritised by Wexford County Council, were included in the 2021 – 2025 Capital programme. A new three bay fire station at New Ross was officially opened by Minister Darragh O’Brien in November 2022. Comprehensive refurbishment and enhancement works to Gorey Fire station were completed in July 2024, both projects were fully funded through the Fire Service Capital programme.  Under the 2021 – 2025 Fire Services Capital Programme to date, Wexford Fire Service has received €3.8 million in capital funding to,  • support priority infrastructural projects at New Ross and Gorey;  • a new confined space training rig for Bunclody fire station;  • improvements to PPE drying facilities at Wexford and Enniscorthy fire stations;  • upgrading and refurbishment of the existing frontline emergency fleet;  • new equipment to support enhanced response to RTC and HazMat incidents;  • funding for the allocation of a new Class B fire tender under the 2021 – 2023 Office of Government Procurement (OGP) framework.  Wexford Fire Service has also received funding approval of approximately €800,000 to support the planned purchase of an hydraulic platform, and Class B appliance to supplement the frontline fleet as well as a further allocation of a new Class B fire tender under the 2023 – 2025 OGP Framework, scheduled for completion and delivery in July 2026.  My Department will be identifying new priority fire service infrastructural projects for the period 2026 – 2030 in the coming months. My Department will work closely with Wexford County Council to progress their identified priority infrastructural projects, within the context of the totality of requests from fire authorities countrywide for capital funding.

        "answerText": " Minister for Social Protection  Educational Sector Workers (ESWs), including school bus drivers, who wish to avail of income support while temporarily laid-off during the school breaks can apply for a jobseeker’s payment. They must satisfy all the qualifying conditions to receive a payment. This includes completing the relevant claim application forms and supporting documentation a in a timely manner while also being available for full-time work and genuinely seeking work at each school break.  A jobseeker’s payment is only paid for days of unemployment where the person is not being remunerated for by their employer, including receipt of any holiday pay entitlement during the school break.  Those who have previously been in contact with my Department, are issued with a repeat jobseeker’s application form and a holiday entitlement form in advance of the school holiday periods. This advance process facilitates an efficient service to these customers and allows for speedy processing of their claim when the period of unemployment actually arises.  It is important to note that Educational Sector Workers, including school bus drivers, are still required to sign on for each period of unemployment and satisfy all the qualifying conditions for a jobseeker’s payment. As each claim is assessed individually, and each person's employment history, including previous claims is different, the payment due will also be different.  It should be noted, there is no specific scheme available for Educational Sector Workers when they are temporarily laid-off during all the school breaks. The appropriate scheme is jobseeker’s subject to the person meeting all the qualifying conditions including being available for full-time work and genuinely seeking work.  Over the last number of years my Department has dedicated teams working solely on Education Sector Workers claims in order to minimise delays for people. However, the large volume of jobseeker's claims received at the school breaks means that some decisions on these claims may take a number of weeks to process. If any customer is in urgent financial need my Department’s Community Welfare Service can provide assistance while they wait for their claim to be processed.  I trust this clarifies the issue for the Deputy. "
