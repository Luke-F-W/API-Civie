        "answerText": " Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage (Deputy James Browne)  The Vacant Property Refurbishment Grant, introduced in July 2022, provides a grant of up to €50,000 for the refurbishment of vacant properties for occupation as a principal private residence and for properties which will be made available for rent. A top-up grant of up to €20,000 is available where the property is confirmed to be derelict, bringing the total grant available for a derelict property up to a maximum of €70,000. In order to qualify for the grant, the property must be vacant for two years or more at the time of application.  A comprehensive review of the Vacant Property Refurbishment Grant and the commitments in the Programme for Government were considered as part of the new housing plan which was launched in November.  The housing plan Delivering Homes, Building Communities 2025-2030 has committed to improve and expand the Vacant Property Refurbishment Grant including by introducing an 'Above the Shop' top up grant. My Department is currently progressing this work.  Any changes to the current Vacant Property Refurbishment Grant would be communicated in a timely manner to all interested parties and implemented from a future date. ",

        "answerText": " Minister of State at the Department of Health  The current Obesity Policy and Action Plan (OPAP) was launched in September 2016 under the auspices of the Healthy Ireland Framework (Healthy Ireland: A Framework for Improved Health and Wellbeing 2013-2025).  OPAP covers a 10-year period up to 2025 and the overall aim is to reverse obesity trends, prevent health complications, and reduce the impact of overweight and obesity on health outcomes for individuals, families, the health system, and the wider society and economy. It recognises that obesity is a complex, multi-faceted problem and needs a multi-pronged solution, with every sector of society playing its part. OPAP is well aligned with the World Health Organisation in terms of the breadth of policy measures that have been introduced or are being considered in order to address the obesity epidemic.  Under OPAP, Ireland put in place a comprehensive, cross-Government strategy to address obesity and overweight. Since 2016 significant progress has been made in delivering on the Ten Step Programme of OPAP and to drive policy initiatives and actions, ranging from health promotion and education initiatives and obesity prevention measures through to establishing services to treat and manage obesity within the health care system.  Under OPAP, funding has been provided for numerous initiatives and programmes aimed at implementing the actions set out in OPAP, which include actions aimed at tackling the prevalence of high fat, sugar and salt (HFSS) foods, which are a type of ultra processed food.  In 2016, the Department of Health indicated its intention to introduce a food reformulation strategy for Ireland. The strategy was published in 2021 and is outlined in A Roadmap for Food Product Reformulation in Ireland. To implement the Roadmap, The Food Reformulation Task Force, a strategic partnership between the Food Safety Authority of Ireland (FSAI) and Healthy Ireland, was established in 2022, with funding provided by the Department on an annual basis in order to carry out implementation of the roadmap. Funding was extended to 2027 for the FSAI to continue working with the Food industry to reduce nutrients of concern, such as fat, salt and sugar in commonly consumed food in Ireland.  In 2021, Sláintecare Healthy Ireland in the Department of Health, working with the HSE and local authorities and community agencies, launched the Sláintecare Healthy Communities Programme to provide increased health and wellbeing services in 24 community areas across Ireland. This Programme employs a Community Food & Nutrition worker in each of the communities that have been identified as disadvantaged, who work to improve community health and wellbeing in the community areas by addressing the issues of poor diet and food poverty.  In 2024, the Safefood ‘Building a Healthier Environment’ public health campaign was launched by the then Minister of State for Public Health, Well Being and the National Drugs Strategy Colm Burke. The campaign aims to raise awareness of the unhealthy food environment, how this is harmful to children’s health and why it needs to change, particularly by highlighting the current prevalence and accessibility of unhealthy foods within the food environment and highlighting how much unhealthy foods in supermarkets are placed at children’s eye level. To this end, the Department of Health has engaged regularly with Coimisiún na Meán regarding the issue of restricting the advertisement of HFSS foods to children and will continue to engage with An Coimisiún on an ongoing basis as work in this area continues.  The Food Safety Authority of Ireland (FSAI) as Ireland’s independent regulator is the central competent authority for the enforcement of food safety legislation. The European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) provides independent scientific advice to support European policies and legislation related to food. Advice from EFSA and FSAI informs European laws, rules and policymaking, which helps protect consumers from risks in the food chain. Regulation EC 178/2002 (General Food Law) provides the legal framework for ensuring food safety and consumer protection within the European Union (EU).  In the EU, food additives are identified by an E number, and their safety is evaluated before they can be permitted for use in food. Food additives are substances which are intentionally added to food to perform a technological function during manufacturing, processing, or storage. Only approved food additives, which are included in Regulation (EC) No 1333/2008 on food additives, can be used in foods on the EU market. EFSA evaluates the safety of regulated products like food additives before they can be authorised for the EU market. Scientific assessments are carried out to ensure that additives are safe for human consumption before and after authorisation. This involves evaluating both new additives and re-evaluating existing ones. Based on these evaluations, EFSA makes recommendations to the European Commission.  Regulation (EU) No. 1169/2011 on the provision of food information to consumers, sets out the general principles and obligations regarding the provision of food information, including the declaration of ingredients. This Regulation requires that food additives are identified by the name of the category they belong to, followed by their specific name or E number in the list of ingredients.  As there is no legal definition of Ultra Processed Food (UPF) the WHO are in the process of convening an expert advisory group to develop a guideline to assist member states to promote healthier, safer and more sustainable diets as a priority through a variety of actions.  The current OPAP runs through to the end of 2025, and a successor Obesity Policy and Action Plan will be drafted by the Department in 2026. 2026. As part of this process of preparing the next OPAP, the department will consider the learning from the existing OPAP, examine the data from the extensive consultation process conducted over the last nine months and reflect on all emerging evidence to inform how the new Obesity Policy and Action plan will be designed.

        "answerText": " The Taoiseach  I propose to take Questions Nos. 1 to 11, inclusive, together.  The Government is committed to the delivery of a national security strategy and work is ongoing in finalising the strategy, co-ordinated by the national security secretariat in my Department and integrating inputs from a range of relevant stakeholders, including the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, the Department of Defence, the Department of Justice, Home Affairs and Migration, An Garda Síochána, the Defence Forces and the National Cybersecurity Centre.  The programme for Government, securing Ireland's future sets out a number of national security commitments, acknowledging that this is a time of upheaval, in particular geopolitical upheaval, with threats and challenges arising from a rapidly changing global geopolitical landscape. The preparation of a draft strategy covers a broad range of national security issues. There is necessarily a focus on the State’s internal security, including the evolving challenges we face from terrorism and extremism and from cyber threats, and a focus on the need to increase our investment in security and to modernise our legislation in the security field, notably in the investigatory powers available to our services. It will include also the implications of recent security, defence and international developments and their related impacts, notably the deteriorating security situation in Europe given Russia's ongoing war in Ukraine and the growth in cyber and hybrid threats in Europe. It will combine an enhanced maritime domain awareness with a prioritised focus on ensuring protection of critical maritime infrastructure, especially critical undersea infrastructure. The ongoing implementation of the report of the Commission on the Defence Forces and the modernisation of aspects of our defence legislation is also included in the preparations.  The National Cyber Security Centre has been placed under the remit of the Minister for Justice, Home Affairs and Migration. This is an important element of the realignment of our national security infrastructure, and a project has been initiated to establish this new statutory national security authority, led by the Department of Justice, Home Affairs and Migration. Earlier this year, I established the Ministerial Council on National Security, which comprises me as chair, the Tánaiste, the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade and for Defence, and the Minister for Justice, Home Affairs and Migration. The council will ensure that at the highest level there is a structured, ongoing review of our strategic national security interests and systematised monitoring of progress on delivering the Government’s commitments over the coming months, including the finalisation of the draft national security strategy. \n Deputy Tom Brabazon  As the Taoiseach is aware, drone sightings in Dublin Bay during the recent Zelenskyy visit underline and underscore the scale of our vulnerabilities and the urgency and need for preparing a strategic national security package. There are reports that international anti-drone units were deployed to Dublin during the visit to assist the emergency response unit. While we welcome the assistance of other states, we should not have to rely on others for our own defence. We should be self-reliant in the first instance. It should be expected that such activity will continue when Ireland takes over the EU Presidency next year, and a national security strategy would allow us to assess risks facing the State, including emergency aerial and technological threats, and set clear goals to guide Government and law makers. Can the Taoiseach provide an update to the House on the development of Ireland's national security strategy and an update on the drone sightings during the Zelenskyy visit? \n Deputy Albert Dolan  When we are talking about national security, it is vital we also give people confidence at a local level in our local security, particularly with regard to An Garda Síochána. In Galway East we have towns that are booming, thriving and growing such as Gort, Loughrea, Tuam and Athenry. Those towns are all feeding into Galway city. They have seen massive population increases and for those people to feel secure in those towns, we need an increase in our gardaí allocation and our gardaí numbers. More importantly, as the populations continue to grow in these towns, we need gardaí that become community gardaí, that the people know and connect with and can build relationships with into the future. These gardaí will serve the area. Our gardaí on the ground right now are working really hard but they need to be supported to handle the large caseloads right across the country but particularly in Galway East, we need additional gardaí. \n Deputy Paul Murphy  Does the Taoiseach think there is any national security implications for the significant decline in basic civil liberties that is happening in Britain, such as the proscription of organisations of Palestine protestors like Palestine Action, the denial of the right to a jury in the vast majority of trials and what is happening with the Palestine protesters who are charged with nothing more than property damage and who have been held for over a year without trial and without access to bail? The consequence is there are now eight protesters on hunger strike for over 30 days. This is the longest, most significant hunger strike since the H-block hunger strikers. Their demands are minimal, namely, the right to a fair trial, the right to access bail, the right to access medical care in prison and for the ending of the proscription of Palestine Action. There is an almost total media blackout on this in Britain, leading people to suspect there is a so-called D-notice in relation to this. Is the Taoiseach concerned about the decline of civil liberties and the fact that people are forced to go on hunger strike in Britain? \n Deputy Ryan O'Meara  Next year we will hold the Presidency of Europe. During that time, as the Taoiseach is more than aware, our national security will be of paramount importance. Given what has happened with drone activity and interference in Denmark, there is a fear the same will happen in Ireland. With President Zelenskyy's visit last week, we saw drones off the coast of Dublin. It is one thing for us to be a militarily neutral country, and that is right, but it is another thing for us to be able to say whether we can patrol our own skies and protect our own airspace. In light of the Presidency coming up in the middle part of next year, what will our national security strategy do? When will we see it? What will be in it regarding the protection of our skies and airports from rogue actors operating drones? \n Deputy Rose Conway-Walsh  The very serious incident of five drones endeavouring to intercept the plane carrying President Zelenskyy last week brought our unpreparedness on defence and national security into sharp focus. Was the C70 form completed to ensure that a Garda defence co-ordinated response was put in place? Were all protocols followed? Why did the navy ship not have drone-disabling equipment? Why were airlines not informed that there was drone activity in the vicinity into which they were flying?  Lieutenant General Rossa Mulcahy told John Mooney of The Sunday Times that the military needs more personnel, intelligence and high-tech capabilities to navigate these uncertain times. Why is the Taoiseach so reluctant to allow the defence and national security committee to do what its title suggests and have oversight of national security? \n Deputy Peadar Tóibín  Can the Taoiseach categorically say that the Government is able to protect all of the EU leaders who will come to this country during the EU Presidency? Who launched the drones that were seen off Dublin Bay during the Zelenskyy visit? Why were those drones not dealt with? Where did these drones come from? Where did they retreat to? How come none of that information is known at this stage? Who was behind the drones? We have heard statements that it is likely that they may have come from Russia, but what evidence is there of this? One of the more memorable answers the Taoiseach gave to a question on national security in the previous Dáil, when the issue of the so-called Russian spy was discussed, was that he did not receive those briefings. He quite pointedly said he did not receive the information he should be receiving on that. How can people in Ireland have confidence, given the fact that our Defence Forces have been run down for so long and we can only staff one ship on the seas at any given time? \n Deputy Paul Lawless  The national security strategy consultation launched in 2019 was intended to guide our strategy on security for the past five years, from 2020-25. Despite this, no strategy was published during this timeframe. During that timeframe we had a huge ransomware attack on the HSE which put a significant number of people's lives and health in jeopardy and cost the State several million euro. What is happening on this? When will the strategy be published? It is costing the State a significant amount of money. \n Deputy Ruairí Ó Murchú  We need some sort of detail and we need to know there is a plan to address cybersecurity and hybrid warfare. The HSE attack brought to light what was probably happening to a lot of businesses which did not provide information. There has been increased funding for the National Cyber Security Centre, NCSC, but we need to get down to brass tacks. There have been drone attacks over the past while and we need to make sure that we have the capacity and technological know-how to be able to deal with these issues. There has been a failure to date in respect of funding to ensure we have the full capacity required. \n Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett  One of the biggest atrocities and national security breaches was the Dublin-Monaghan bombing carried out by the Glenanne gang. There were headlines yesterday stating that there was no collusion in the Dublin-Monaghan bombing. First, the Kenova report yesterday dealt with Stakeknife, not the Dublin-Monaghan bombing. The Denton report will not be published until January. \n The Taoiseach  It was a summary of Denton. \n Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett  The report states that the British Army had the names of the killers on the night of the bombing but nobody was ever arrested. The representatives of the families think that smacks of collusive behaviour. The authors were also extremely critical of the Irish authorities, including the Garda, and the British authorities for destroying much of the files and evidence so that the people compiling the report could not gather conclusive evidence. The whole thing stinks to high heaven. The representatives of the families have asked for a public inquiry. Will the Taoiseach listen to them? \n The Taoiseach  I thank all Deputies who raised issues in terms of national security and the national security strategy. It reflects a growing awareness and engagement with this House, not before time, in respect of security and defence issues. There has been a wilful ignoring of these issues for far too long in the House. Particular perspectives have been taken on this. Even this morning, there were references to the United Kingdom, Europe or America as being threats. The clear threats right now in this era include a Russian threat to our security and security infrastructure. We have had engagement between Iran and Russia and North Korea and Russia. North Korean soldiers have been on European soil during a period of war, seeking to violate the territorial integrity of Ukraine and its sovereignty. These are the realities we face. We wish we were not facing these realities and we would prefer a Continent at peace and so on.  The strategy will be completed. Deputy Brabazon was the first to speak and referred to self-reliance. We will develop radar capacity, and that is very close to action in terms of procurement – a lot of work has gone into that. We need to co-operate and co-ordinate with other member states in the European Union and the United Kingdom in respect of all of these issues because a pattern has developed in terms of the emergence of these drones and the violation of the airspace of EU member states. The most notable incident occurred in Copenhagen at the time of the European Political Community meeting. Denmark sought help and advice from other EU member states at that time. There were incidents in Belgium, France, Poland, in terms of train tracks and so on, and in the Baltic Sea. We are agreed that, on the drone issue, disabling technology is important.  The visit of President Zelenskyy was very effective from a security perspective. I want to make it clear to everybody that an incident did occur on that night. A small number of unidentified drones were observed in the vicinity of a Naval Service vessel on patrol off the coast of Dublin. The drones were not a threat to President Zelenskyy's aircraft - that needs to be clear - because it had safely landed quite some time prior to the incident, nor were they a threat to his departure. An operational response was put in place that was appropriate to the circumstances by the commander of the naval vessel at the time and, subsequently, by the police and military authorities working in close co-operation. They worked closely together in advance of the visit and so on.  The Garda liaised with its Ukrainian partners throughout the visit of the President on the security arrangements, including with regard to this incident. The Garda special detective unit is carrying out an investigation of the circumstances of the incident with input from the Defence Forces. It is a very concerning incident, as I said, like other similar incidents in other European states. The circumstances are suggestive of this being part of an ongoing Russian-inspired hybrid campaign against European Union and Ukrainian interests. \n Deputy Paul Murphy  I would like the Taoiseach to present some evidence. He said the circumstances are suggestive----- \n The Taoiseach  Of course the Deputy would. Could I say to Deputy Brabazon----- \n Deputy Paul Murphy  The circumstances are contested. It might well have been the Russians but I would like to see some evidence if this will be used as an agenda to undermine our neutrality. \n An Ceann Comhairle  We just cannot have this, Deputy Murphy. \n The Taoiseach  The gardaí----- \n An Ceann Comhairle  We cannot have this interaction. \n The Taoiseach  I will come back to the Deputy. \n Deputy Paul Murphy  I thank the Taoiseach. \n The Taoiseach  An Garda Síochána is substantively enhancing and has enhanced its anti-drone capabilities. It has significant capabilities on land, and the navy likewise. The military generally has the capabilities throughout all three strands: air, sea and land. We will continue to enhance that and harness all technology available in the country, both private sector but also on our university campuses that can assist in that regard.  All politics is local and Deputy Dolan asked about gardaí in east Galway and the expanding towns. We have seen good progress in the recruitment of gardaí through Templemore. It has seen its highest intake this year. The Commissioner has been allocating significant numbers to given areas. Dublin benefited initially. Cork is benefiting now, to be quite frank, in terms of the city centre. The idea is to get around to the rest of the country but to do it in significant numbers so it really has impact. I understand we are pleading for patience on the Deputy's behalf and others but we are making progress. Funding is there to keep the throughput at the level it currently is in Templemore.  On the remarks made by Deputy Murphy, the United Kingdom does not present a national security threat to Ireland. \n Deputy Paul Murphy  The Taoiseach should have read the Denton report. \n The Taoiseach  On the issue he raised in terms of the civil liberties issue within the UK, it is an issue the UK has to challenge and deal with. I noted his comment, \"nothing more than property damage\". That was interesting. I do not believe people should be----- \n Deputy Paul Murphy  Interned for property damage. \n The Taoiseach  No one should be interned and there should be trials. I love the Deputy's casual approach to property damage. It is fine. It is grand. Do not worry about it. Let us continue doing it. \n Deputy Paul Murphy  That is not what I said. \n The Taoiseach  It is what he implied. \n Deputy Paul Murphy  No, it is not. \n The Taoiseach  Ah, come on. \n Deputy Paul Murphy  The point I was making is it is not normal to hold people----- \n The Taoiseach  We discussed this----- \n An Ceann Comhairle  Deputy Murphy made his point already. \n Deputy Paul Murphy  -----without trial for over a year for property damage. \n An Ceann Comhairle  We are not doing this, Deputy Murphy. We are not doing this. \n Deputy Paul Murphy  That is the point I was making and the Taoiseach knows it. \n An Ceann Comhairle  There are other Members to be regarded. \n The Taoiseach  Can I just say to Deputy Murphy that Deputies in this House have had their property damaged. I do not believe that should lead to internment or anything like that. \n Deputy Paul Murphy  Exactly. \n The Taoiseach  No, no. \n An Ceann Comhairle  Allow the Taoiseach to answer. \n The Taoiseach  Let us be very clear. In dealing with protest, there are different levels of protest. The right to protest and to free speech is absolutely inviolable. It has to be allowed and facilitated in any true democracy. When protests get too extreme, you then impact on other people's rights to personal safety, life and property. I respectfully suggest that is something the Deputy does not pay much attention to. \n Deputy Paul Murphy  Israeli weaponry property? No. \n The Taoiseach  In terms of the other issue Deputy O'Meara raised, I have dealt with some of the aspects of what happened on the night and so forth. In terms of the EU Presidency, which people have raised, there is a lot of work under way to prepare for that. An Garda Síochána is central to the security planning and preparation. It has established a dedicated European Union Presidency co-ordination office, led by the deputy commissioner of policing operations to oversee all aspects of operational planning, logistics and inter-agency engagement. There is ongoing interdepartmental engagement through a whole range of forums. Close co-operation with European policing and security partners concerning the Presidency is ongoing, as per the norm.  In the modern security arena, you have to co-ordinate, co-operate and share intelligence with other agencies. That is absolutely key. Otherwise, you are at nothing in terms of protecting the State or protecting our people. I do not want to go into all of the details here. Some of this is security sensitive. I have a report about the drone situation. When we are discussing security, there has to be an understanding there are limits to what can be put into the public domain. That impacts further gathering and garnering of intelligence. It also impacts on our capacity to withstand further threats and so on like that. There will be a lot of planning for VIP protection, venue security, transport management, cyber resilience and public order contingencies. All of that is being worked on. It is a mammoth task. It is a huge operation. Other member states have had to do something similar. It is symptomatic of where we are in terms of the threats to European security and so forth.  I think I have dealt with most of the issues Deputy Rose Conway-Walsh raised and I was responding to her in respect of that. \n Deputy Rose Conway-Walsh  Sorry, the Taoiseach has not----- \n An Ceann Comhairle  Absolutely not, Deputy. The Deputy has to take the answer. \n Deputy Rose Conway-Walsh  I just want to put it on the record the Taoiseach has not answered. \n The Taoiseach  I am not finished yet. No member state yet, bar France in the past 48 hours or so, has attempted to disabled drones or bring them down, for different reasons. That is a matter we have to leave to the operational people in charge. We cannot dictate that sort of a response here. \n Deputy Rose Conway-Walsh  Do we have the capacity? \n An Ceann Comhairle  Deputy, no. \n The Taoiseach  We have the capacity. \n An Ceann Comhairle  If the Deputy needs to raise a Topical Issue, she can put one down. This is not a back and forth. \n The Taoiseach  Once again, it is a matter for those on the ground and in the theatre to decide the best and most appropriate response at the time.  I have dealt with some of Deputy Tóibín's questions. The national security council has been established. There is a clear structure emanating from that in terms of awareness, being briefed and so forth. I was briefed on this incident. I sought a briefing immediately on it and I received it. Obviously, it is something that will be discussed at the national security council later.  In terms of Deputy Lawless----- \n Deputy Peadar Tóibín  The Taoiseach has not categorically----- \n An Ceann Comhairle  No. If the Deputy is not happy with the answer, put down----- \n Deputy Peadar Tóibín  -----stated that EU leaders will be safe during the Presidency. \n An Ceann Comhairle  Deputy Tóibín, you know you are wrong. \n Deputy Peadar Tóibín  He also has not stated where those drones came from and where they went. \n An Ceann Comhairle  I am asking the Deputy to stop addressing the Taoiseach until he finishes his answers, \n Deputy Peadar Tóibín  He has not answered those questions. \n An Ceann Comhairle  The Deputy might not like the answer but it is the Taoiseach's answer. Do not interject again, please. \n The Taoiseach  I was just about to make the point in terms of the cybersecurity attacks. Sorry, we will protect those who are coming into this country. There is no question. Do not always be so fast to denigrate ourselves. Do not listen to all the noise out there. What happened during President Zelenskyy's visit was a good security operation by our Defence Forces and by an Garda----- \n Deputy Peadar Tóibín  Why will the Taoiseach not answer the question about the drones? \n An Ceann Comhairle  Deputy, please have respect for the other Members. \n The Taoiseach  Through the Chair, we need to acknowledge that and the very effective work of An Garda Síochána and our Defence Forces. There is a lot of noise which suits other interests to portray Ireland in a certain light. The Deputy should be wary of that, too.  Deputy Lawless raised the issue of cybersecurity. Cyber threats and attacks have increased significantly since the Russian invasion of Ukraine. Some have been by criminal elements, some have been by professionals. There are also third party state actors in respect of cybersecurity threats. It is a very serious issue for both public utilities and private sector companies. It is costing a lot of funding to deal with that. We have brought the National Cyber Security Centre under the Department of justice. It is a very strong centre and has grown in capacity very significantly in the past five years. I remember when we started it. It has developed a really strong capacity under Richard Browne. Credit needs to be given in respect of that.  I make the point to Deputy Ó Murchú that there is not a failure in funding, frankly, and finance will not be an issue here. What is an issue is the procurement timelines, both within the European defence industry and more generally. We are working to see if we can accelerate procurement. We are doing that with the radar. That is why we took a joint country approach to procurement - to fast track it. In other words, we use the experience and expertise of countries that have experience of procuring the radar we are now seeking. Everyone will be about how fast we can procure. It will also be about taking an intelligent approach in terms of what we procure. The nature of modern warfare or security threats has changed radically. We are all witnessing the drone technology change, as well as the cybersecurity. What can we do undersea? How do we protect cables? How do we protect gas connectors? It is a whole-of-society security approach that is required here. It is not the traditional, conventional approach to defence and security. We need to consider and explore that point more, perhaps.  On the Dublin-Monaghan bombing, Deputy Boyd-Barrett is correct insofar as the summary of the Denton report was produced yesterday. It is regrettable that we do not have the full Denton report. I think there was some legal action taken to try to prevent it being published in full. The Kenova report has been published. We should have a debate on the Kenova report in this House in the new year. It reveals very sordid activity by state actors but also by paramilitaries, including the Provisional IRA. The Kenova report does not pull its punches in saying it was a threat to its own community or attacked its own community. What went on is quite unbelievable.  The Denton report stated that 120 people were murdered by a network of loyalist paramilitaries and RUC and UDR personnel, including those killed in the Dublin-Monaghan bombings. It is a very sordid story and both the Kenova and Denton reports cover it. I pay tribute to Jon Boutcher, who is now the head of the PSNI, for his leadership on Kenova, and also to Iain Livingstone. They withstood a lot of pressure. We will have two comprehensive reports, if we can get the latter one published. \n An Ceann Comhairle  That is it, Taoiseach. We move to questions Nos. 12 to 28, inclusive. With 16 Members and a remaining 18 and a half minutes, it is highly unlikely we will get to the third group of questions. I ask Members to be brief. ",

        "answerText": " The Taoiseach  I propose to take Questions Nos. 12 to 28, inclusive, together.  The Cabinet committee on infrastructure last met on 3 November and will meet again early in the new year. The Cabinet committee works to drive infrastructure delivery and the implementation of the revised national development plan. As Members know, last week, we brought to Government the essence of that plan. The reform of the delivery of critical, growth-enhancing infrastructure is a key commitment in the programme for Government. Last week marked a major milestone on this agenda with the publication of the accelerating infrastructure report and action plan.  This plan sets out 30 high-impact and time-bound reforms to speed and scale up delivery of homes, roads, public transport, wastewater plants and energy infrastructure. Actions include legislative reforms to balance individual rights and public good, simplify regulation and consenting systems, cut administrative burden and red tape and build public acceptance and a delivery culture. The reforms align with broader housing, climate and competitiveness goals. These will be achieved by streamlining approvals to allow concurrent processing, introducing statutory timelines for major project decisions, rationalising delivery guidance to reduce duplication and complexity, enhancing procurement practices through clearer project pipelines, and fostering a delivery-focused culture that balances safeguards with urgency.  We are at a critical juncture. We have a strong economy and growing population, but our infrastructure delivery is too slow. We have a once-in-a-generation opportunity to transform this. The Government, private sector and communities must align behind delivery. The plan is underscored by the largest capital investment in the history of the State, with over €275 billion planned over the coming ten years.  Over recent weeks, Departments have published their ambitious sectoral investment plans for the next five years. Areas such as energy, transport and water will see a significant scale-up in funding and delivery, all of which will support us to address our infrastructure deficit and scale up housing. There will also be robust oversight of the Government’s performance in achieving these actions with regular reports on progress to the Cabinet committee on infrastructure. In the period ahead, the Cabinet committee will, therefore, oversee both the investments and reforms required to ensure that infrastructure is delivered as efficiently and quickly as possible. \n An Ceann Comhairle  There are 12 Deputies present. They will have 30 seconds each, which means there will be six minutes for questions and six minutes for a response. That is as fair as I can be. \n Deputy Aindrias Moynihan  The recently published national development plan update sets out an ambitious plan for key infrastructure for the years ahead. Many of the capital works are due to get under way by 2030 and others thereafter. Having a pipeline of projects ready is vital because there is so much background work involved with them. I am particularly focused on the ones after 2030. We have seen how the N22 Macroom bypass took many years to advance through the earlier stages, such as the background works, planning and design and so on. The next phase of that road is the piece between Macroom and Ballincollig. It needs to continue in the background and get through the various background stages so that we have a pipeline of projects ready to roll as soon as possible. \n Deputy Ruairí Ó Murchú  We have all seen a huge amount of flood damage and the danger of nature. While a huge amount of work has been done by local authorities and emergency services, this brings to light the need to deal expeditiously with CFRAM protections that are necessary throughout Louth. With regard to the south part of the Dundalk and Blackrock project, the promise is quarter 2 of 2027 for planning application submission. There have been promises and we have been waiting years. \n The Taoiseach  Is that CFRAM? \n Deputy Ruairí Ó Murchú  It is CFRAM. There are five particular projects throughout Louth, in Drogheda, Carlingford, Greenore, Baltray and Ardee. The lack of wastewater capacity is also causing issues. \n Deputy Albert Dolan  We need to double-track the rail line from Galway city to Athenry. The passing loop at Oranmore is under construction now. Ceannt Station is moving to be a station with five platforms. Huge investment has gone in but we must continue it because we are going to wait years for the Galway city outer bypass and the reality is that rail is the lever we can pull. We can build a double track from Athenry to Galway city which would greatly improve the quality of life for all commuters in east Galway. \n Deputy Darren O'Rourke  We need updated wind and solar farm guidelines. The wind farm guidelines are in draft form since 2019 and the last full version was in 2006. There is a commitment in the programme for Government for solar farm guidelines but recent responses say they are at a very early stage of a scoping process. When will they be ready? \n Deputy Paul Murphy  The new roll-out of BusConnects routes has been a disaster in my constituency. Constituents report that buses on the F spine route, which were supposed to provide a more direct route to the city centre and greater connectivity, are taking 20 to 30 minutes longer to get into town and providing fewer options for people trying to get to work or school. It is made worse by the frequent delays and cancellations seen across nearly all routes in Dublin South-West, including the S and W spines operated by Go-Ahead Ireland. Elsewhere, the NTA has been forced to change routes in Finglas and Chapelizod due to protests and people making their voices heard. Will the NTA do the same here or will people be forced to protest? \n Deputy Séamus McGrath  Central to a good infrastructure system is a good public transport system. I welcome the approval of BusConnects Cork by Cabinet to proceed to the planning phase. That is very welcome but we cannot wait years for improvements to the local bus service. I am sure the Taoiseach, like other public representatives in Cork, is inundated with unreliability issues relating to local bus services, such as buses not turning up, disappearing buses and inaccurate information on the travel app. It is simply not good enough and it has been going on for years. People are tired of excuses from the National Transport Authority and Bus Éireann. I ask the Taoiseach to please take this issue up and look for immediate improvements. \n Deputy Tony McCormack  While we prioritise electricity, water and transport, digital connectivity must now be treated equally. It is essential for Ireland's competitiveness. Europe has fallen behind the US and China. 5G stand-alone is under 2% in the EU and 0% in Ireland, compared with 20% in the US and 80% in China. AI, ehealth and advanced manufacturing cannot run on yesterday’s networks. If we want future investment in next-generation technology, connectivity must be prioritised. Will the Cabinet committee on infrastructure evaluate 5G stand-alone as a national priority? During Ireland's EU Presidency, will the Government push for strong, pro-investment digital policy under the digital networks Act? \n Deputy Peadar Tóibín  The Navan to Dublin rail line is not included in the national development plan review as a project that will start to be built before 2030. It has no start date for construction at all at the moment. It is up to a future government to fund the construction of a Navan to Dublin rail line. No money has been assigned or ring-fenced for that particular project, despite the fact there are 90,000 people commuting from Meath at the moment, 60,000 of whom travel by car and add to the M50 crisis. The M50 is currently grinding to a halt. If the Government wants to help fix the M50 crisis, allow people in Meath to use public transport to get to work without pushing them into cars every single day. \n Deputy Paul Lawless  Ireland faces an emergency crisis in terms of infrastructure, housing, energy and water. According to the ESRI, an additional 40,000 construction workers will be needed for the housing plan and an additional 40,000 will be needed for infrastructure. That is 80,000 construction workers who are required to meet the Government’s plan. Indeed, the Dublin metro will require 8,000 construction workers. What is the Taoiseach’s plan in order to achieve this? I speak to construction workers in Australia all the time. They want to come home but they are simply totally disenfranchised and disengaged. The Government has no interest in bringing them home. \n Deputy Rose Conway-Walsh  I know the Taoiseach will agree that the people in Mayo deserve to have proper road infrastructure. I want to specifically talk to him about the R312, which is the main road connecting Erris to the county town of Castlebar. I want it to be designated a regional strategic road because that is the only way it will get the funding it needs. It is a dangerous road. People have put up with it for years but it is time for it to be fixed. \n The Taoiseach  Which one is that? \n Deputy Rose Conway-Walsh  It is the R312. I thank the Taoiseach. \n Deputy Barry Heneghan  Ba mhaith liom ceist a chur ar an Taoiseach faoin flooding we saw in Clontarf yesterday. I thank the Minister of State, Deputy Boxer Moran, for coming down and sorting out the dreaded sandbags, but households and businesses were very worried yesterday. I had tens of people----- \n The Taoiseach  Where was that? \n Deputy Barry Heneghan  Clontarf. Does the Taoiseach not know I am a Clontarf man? The flood defence is critically needed. Will flood defences be included in critical infrastructure with the recent announcement last week? This needs to be fast-tracked and people and businesses need assurance. \n An Ceann Comhairle  Finally, Deputy Conor D. McGuinness. \n Deputy Conor D. McGuinness  Once again, I am raising with the Taoiseach the N25, which is the transport spine of Waterford's infrastructure and long regarded as the most dangerous national road in the State. There has been no funding for safety improvements. Routine maintenance, resurfacing and line painting are not good enough at this stage. Bus stops are being withdrawn. There was another HGV incident this morning just outside Dungarvan. We need to see serious investment in safety improvements on the N25 right from Rosslare to Cork city, but particularly in Waterford where there has been no funding for safety improvements. \n An Ceann Comhairle  Taoiseach, the floor is yours for five minutes. \n The Taoiseach  I love the demarcation lines. The \"Rosslare to Cork city, but particularly in Waterford\" part of it. I am sorry. I get it. Do not worry. \n Deputy Conor D. McGuinness  There have been no safety upgrades. There was a serious incident there this morning. \n The Taoiseach  It is just an observation. I will start with Deputy Aindrias Moynihan, who made a very good point. Hopefully, with this national development plan and the allocation of ten years, we will avoid this stop-start where we get a project from A to B but C is not provided for at all. We had that over the last two decades, I suppose. I recall how the Cork-Limerick road had planning in an earlier era and then that was all shelved after the financial crash and so on. If they had kept the planning going, they would have been in a much better position now to actually start. I do accept that, and particularly on the N22. The Macroom bypass has been extremely effective but there is the problem that you go along a great road into Ballincollig if you are coming from the Kerry side but then you are suddenly into what, as the Deputy was saying to me the other day, is like a parking lot for the next 20 to 40 minutes. It is a very good point that we should encourage Transport Infrastructure Ireland, TII, and others to keep thinking of the next stage and to have the planning ready and preparatory work done. I will work on that particular stretch the Deputy has referenced.  Deputy Ó Murchú raised the flood damage, CFRAM and the five projects in Louth. Deputy Barry Heneghan had a similar point. In general, flood protection schemes take a long time. Some of that is due to stakeholder engagement and public engagement, and there can be objections and so on. If any projects are of such imperative, these are. We do know that when these projects happen, they are effective in protecting against flooding. Towns that had historical flooding events have stopped them because of good infrastructure being put in. These projects invite a lot of objections. We had it in Cork city and it went the whole way to the top courts. It is only now that work is under way and all of that. There was flooding in Cork city this week. It was there because of the tidal levels, but one could argue that if you had the protections in, then businesses and people would have been protected and people could have gone in and out of town. I am very conscious of that.  With regard to Deputy Dolan's question, I will come back to the Minister. It was a good point. I do no know where we are on it in terms of the national development plan but there is no question that Galway city is facing enormous congestion, including all the areas feeding into Galway city. It is a real problem. Public transport, including rail, does give us an option, but not the whole option. We have to get the ring road done. Equally, though, the rail infrastructure is critical. I will talk to the Minister for Transport, Darragh O'Brien, about that.  Deputy O'Rourke raised the issue of the updated wind farm guidelines. The Deputy is correct that they have been a long time coming and technology has changed in the intervening period. I have asked the Minister, James Browne, to accelerate the work on the guidelines. The unit in his Department is also working on planning exemptions. There is a lot of work there. The Department is also working on rural guidelines for housing and one-off housing. There is a lot of work in that Department but I accept that we do need to bring this to a conclusion. At some stage, we need some collective debate on energy. We are all dealing with individual cases of objections to solar, objections to gas generation, objections to wind onshore, and objections to wind offshore potentially. We desperately need the offshore wind. This is something we have got to progress through planning. I am hoping we can get wind farms built, certainly through 2030 to 2031. If we do not, then we are in trouble from an energy perspective. As a collective - when I say \"collective\", I mean the entire Oireachtas - we have to try to stand back and say that there are huge challenges. We discussed security earlier. We are very dependent on the importation of fossil fuels through the interconnectors. There are real issues here that we need to be clear-eyed about. We can then take decisions once everybody realises that there are pluses and minuses in all of this.  Deputy Paul Murphy raised BusConnects, which he said was a \"disaster\"----- \n Deputy Paul Murphy  Some of it. \n The Taoiseach  That is okay. It is a word that is not uncommon. Anyway, I have had my issues with BusConnects down through the years. There have been issues for habitual users of bus services who feel the changing of services or the reorientation of scheduling and so on has eroded what they would have had prior to it. Then we had all the issues around what were, in my view, over-the-top initial plans, which then got rolled back. This seems to have been a pattern throughout the BusConnects journey and I think lessons could be learned from that. A lot of heat built up that perhaps was not necessary in the first place because a lot of stuff that was proposed was then taken away. We will engage with the National Transport Authority, NTA, in terms of what is happening. It has made a lot of progress now on BusConnects. We need a good bus transport system.  That brings me to Deputy Séamus McGrath's point. Yes, I have heard similar reports in terms of reliability. Originally, a year and a half ago, the shortage of drivers was blamed, but we definitely need to improve reliability. There had been very good stuff happening in public transport growth and so on.  I will talk to Deputy McCormack again. The Deputy is absolutely correct that America, China and others are way ahead of us in some of this in the digital space. We need to catch up fairly quickly. I will look at the 5G stand-alone issue.  Deputy Tóibín mentioned the NDP. The Navan rail line is in the NDP review----- \n Deputy Peadar Tóibín  It is not a Bill. \n The Taoiseach  The Deputy has a great capacity. He is brilliant at it, actually. From a political agitation perspective, the Deputy has a great capacity to turn what others would see as success into defeat. For the Deputy in opposition to say that we are not releasing----- \n Deputy Peadar Tóibín  That----- \n An Ceann Comhairle  Do not interrupt. \n Deputy Peadar Tóibín  I have to, a Cheann Comhairle. \n An Ceann Comhairle  No, Deputy Tóibín, do not even dare. \n The Taoiseach  The Deputy is trying to ask how I can----- \n An Ceann Comhairle  Deputy Tóibín will have to look for it afterwards. \n The Taoiseach  I spoke to the Minister, Deputy O'Brien, about this and he is very clear that the Navan line is going ahead. \n Deputy Peadar Tóibín  There is no date for construction. \n An Ceann Comhairle  Do not even think about it. \n The Taoiseach  The Government is absolutely committed to it.  On Deputy Lawless's question, there is a huge increase in apprenticeships. We are recruiting people back. We are anxious for people to come back into the country, and people are coming back into the country. The construction industry is confident enough in terms of the numbers for getting the housing done, for example, and the huge retrofit programme that is going on as well.  I will talk and engage with the Minister in respect of Deputy Conway-Walsh's query on the R312.  Regarding Deputy Heneghan's question, I have discussed that in terms of Clontarf and flood relief generally. It will be part of critical infrastructure, absolutely. I see it as critical infrastructure because it is a big threat to us. The storms are worse and they are more severe. We need to accelerate the protection of people, households and businesses in that respect.  On the N25, we need to get the bypasses along that road. That is a section of the road that definitely needs improvement.  I thank the Ceann Comhairle. \n An Ceann Comhairle  I thank the Taoiseach and Members. For future reference, if there needs to be back and forth, this is not the forum in which to pose a question. \n Deputy Ruairí Ó Murchú  In the review----- \n An Ceann Comhairle  We have a Dáil reform committee today at which it will be discussed. \n The Taoiseach  We need a bit of entertainment and lively engagement, too. \n An Ceann Comhairle  This is not the forum, Taoiseach.

The Cabinet Committee on Housing works to ensure a coordinated, cross Government, approach to the implementation of Programme for Government commitments regarding housing policy.  The Programme for Government sets out our ambition to accelerate housing supply, building on progress already achieved, recognising housing as a major social and economic challenge.  Last month, Government launched the new National Housing Plan, Delivering Homes, Building Communities 2025-2030,  which aims to speed up the delivery of new homes and tackle homelessness. The plan targets the construction of 300,000 homes, including 72,000 social homes and 90,000 affordable housing supports. Building on the progress of Housing for All, which saw 137,000 homes delivered since 2021, the new plan will enable the State, public bodies, and the private sector to further play a critical part in accelerating delivery.  The Cabinet Committee on Housing last met on Monday, 10th November, and is scheduled to meet again on Monday, 15th December. ",

        "answerText": " The Taoiseach  I propose to take Questions Nos. 1 to 12 together.  The UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer and I both attended the recent G20 Summit in South Africa. We had a number of conversations in the margins of meetings there, including on the situation in Ukraine, on which an informal meeting of the coalition of the willing took place. Previously, I met with Prime Minister Starmer at Chequers on 12 September. We discussed a broad range of matters, including the positive state of bilateral relations between Ireland and the UK. We also discussed the legacy framework - this was one of the reasons I went to Chequers - which was published subsequently on 19 September. The Prime Minister and I took note of progress on the UK-Ireland 2030 programme of strategic co-operation since the summit on 6 March on implementation across each of the programme’s four pillars of security, justice and global issues; climate, energy and innovation; growth, trade and investment; and culture, education and people-to-people links. We looked ahead to the second UK-Ireland summit, which Ireland will host in the spring of 2026. This work complements that undertaken under the British-Irish Council, which will meet in Wales later this week, and the British-Irish Intergovernmental Conference, which took place in Dublin on 17 November.  The Prime Minister and I also discussed a range of international issues, including the catastrophic situation in Gaza. We agreed in particular on the then urgent need for a ceasefire, the release of hostages and the delivery of humanitarian aid at scale, as well as finding a pathway to a two-state solution for a lasting peace. We committed to continue to work together with the coalition of the willing to strengthen support for Ukraine and increase pressure on Russia to stop its war of aggression on the people of Ukraine.  Deputies may wish to be aware that the First Minister of Scotland, John Swinney, was in Ireland last week to mark the agreement of a new bilateral co-operation framework between Ireland and Scotland. The new framework includes six broad areas for future co-operation, including in the context of a strengthened Ireland-UK relationship. I also met with First Minister Swinney in Government Buildings during his visit. \n Deputy Brendan Smith  I have had numerous opportunities in this House to welcome in general terms the legacy framework that was agreed between the British and Irish Governments and published in early September. There is an urgent need to enact legislation to give effect to the provisions outlined in the framework. Did the Taoiseach detect an urgency or a very strong commitment from the UK Prime Minister on the need to get this issue dealt with? Many families have waited for justice for decades and decades. We have to move on and get progress on the rights, the concerns and the grief that engulfs so many families of victims for many decades now. At the end of this month, we will mark the 53rd anniversary of the Belturbet bombing, which cost the lives of two young teenagers. We also have had significant dates in relation to commemorations, for example marking the terrible atrocities in Monaghan and Dublin in May 1974. There are so many atrocities for which nobody has been brought to justice. We cannot ever attach enough urgency to trying to deal, once and for all, with legacy issues. \n Deputy Ruth Coppinger  The right to protest against the genocide in Palestine is being severely undermined the UK and this is being carried through to the North as well. I want to raise a case with the Taoiseach that he could raise with the Prime Minister. This is the case of Saoirse Wagner, a student at Queen's University in Belfast, who is being threatened with expulsion for taking part in a peaceful, calm and non-threatening protest on the issue of Palestine. The Palestine assembly in the college protested at the careers fair to highlight companies that are participating in the genocide. I think the Taoiseach will agree with me that taking part in student protest is a fundamental right and so important in our democracy. To threaten a student with their whole third level education being completely taken away for participating in a peaceful protest is something we should take a stand against. I ask the Taoiseach to make representations to the college. Saoirse is known to me. I know that she would not participate in anything violent. I ask the Taoiseach to take this case on board. \n Deputy Ruairí Ó Murchú  We are coming up to the 50th anniversary of the Dundalk bombing, which happened on 19 December 1975. Dundalk lost Hugh Watters, who was a local tailor and a well-respected man, and Jack Rooney, a fireman and a man who worked for the council. Obviously, this was devastating for their families. A memorial event has been organised by the families. It is going to happen near the courthouse, where there is a plaque, at 6.15 p.m. on Friday, 19 December. I think it is very important that we commemorate this 50th anniversary. It was the same night as the attack on Donnelly's Bar in Silverbridge where three people were killed. This was carried out by the Glenanne gang. We know this was a UVF gang which had members of the UDR and the RUC within it and obviously, the British state was up to its neck in relation to it. I would ask about the engagement around producing a framework that will actually deliver for families like these that have been failed and that Britain does not walk away from its role and its dirty war that it fought in Ireland. \n Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett  The Taoiseach said he discussed Gaza and Palestine with Keir Starmer. A standard tactic of the Israeli state has been to say that anybody who criticises Israel for genocide, apartheid, ethnic cleansing or the persecution of Palestinians, is somehow antisemitic. Keir Starmer, of course, has a record of going along with that nonsense and attacking people like Jeremy Corbyn, who is one of the most long-standing anti-racists and an absolute opponent of antisemitism. It is an outrageous accusation. We have now seen an instance of our own ambassador being dressed down by an Israeli minister, who accused the Irish people and the Irish Government of antisemitism. I would like to know what the Taoiseach thinks about that. Is he capitulating to that bullying by the Israeli state by intervening on the proposal to rename Herzog Park? This is an entirely justified proposal, given Chaim Herzog's history of involvement in ethnic cleansing of Palestinians. \n Deputy Peadar Tóibín  A series health crisis is arising in the North of Ireland at the moment. Sinn Féin, the DUP, the UUP and the Alliance Party are closing down key hospital services in Daisy Hill Hospital, Enniskillen and Causeway Hospital in Derry. These closures are having a significant effect on services. Patients in Craigavon hospital are waiting for 19 hours to see their emergency doctor. The waiting time at the emergency department in the Royal Victoria Hospital is nine hours.  One day, there were 40 ambulances stuck at hospitals trying to deliver their patients. The longest waiting time was 13 hours. I pay tribute to the SOS Causeway Hospital campaign and Gemma Brolly, who is involved in that.  The boss of the British Medical Association in the North stated that an all-Ireland GP service would be a way to help resolve these crises. Daisy Hill, Enniskillen and Causeway all have hinterlands that feed into the South of Ireland in areas where there is great need for hospital services too. Is the Taoiseach speaking to the British Prime Minister about developing an all-Ireland health service? \n Deputy Liam Quaide  When I asked the Taoiseach about flood relief for east Cork villages last week, he accused me of being sly in how I had raised the question. That adjective could be more fairly levelled at his British counterpart, Keir Starmer, who built his political career on the basis of being a human rights lawyer and unifier of the left. In power, he has enthusiastically supported the imprisonment of people for years who protest against climate inaction, along with the designation of protesters of genocide as terrorists. I fully appreciate that the UK makes its own political decisions and that we have to maintain good relations with political leaders with whom we often might have major disagreements, but it is also true that Irish citizens are affected by Starmer’s authoritarian crackdown on peaceful protests. Acclaimed novelist Sally Rooney has been prevented from collecting a prestigious Sky Arts award in person due to fears of arrest for her support of Palestine Action. Great-grandmother Máire Ní Mhurchú, originally from Douglas in Cork, was arrested in London in September, along with her sisters Gráinne and Olga, for a peaceful protest against genocide. When the Taoiseach met Keir Starmer, did he raise with him his government's aggressive and authoritarian approach to peaceful protest and its impact on Irish as well as British citizens? \n Deputy Shane Moynihan  With reference to the Taoiseach’s meeting with British Prime Minister, Keir Starmer, I note the progress made by the UK Government with regard to dealing with legacy, and I compliment Deputy Smith on his work in this area in particular.  I note the publication this week by the House of Commons Northern Ireland Affairs Committee around legacy. One of the more interesting recommendations was that Ireland needs to do more with regard to legacy. I would love to hear the Taoiseach's thoughts on that given that all of the legacy investigations of this country have been ECHR compliant, which is not necessarily something that can be said in the case of the UK.  I call for increased and accelerated action on, in particular, the Dublin and Monaghan bombings. That has been raised many times in this House and it needs to fall under the ambit of the legacy issues as well.  What engagement has the Taoiseach had with the Prime Minister on the ongoing humanitarian disaster of a crisis in Sudan, somewhere the international community needs to step up and pay attention? I wish to hear his thoughts on their engagement on that matter. \n Deputy Rose Conway-Walsh  There can be no watering-down of the commitments made in the British and Irish Governments' joined legacy framework. There are parts of that framework I question but it is very important. I welcome the Northern Ireland Affairs Committee report on this legacy legislation. The primary legislation underpinning the political framework is moving through Westminster. The bottom line is that the legislation must command the confidence of the families and be human rights compliant in order for it to properly deal with the legacy of the past. Reports that the legislation, which is already weak in parts, could be watered down are extremely concerning and will not be accepted. It is deeply concerning that any legislation would provide the British Secretary of State with the power to veto disclosure on national security grounds for family reports from the information retrieval body, the ICIR and the new legacy commission. All families and survivors have the right to have an Article 2-compliant investigation into the deaths of their loved ones. \n Deputy Paul Murphy  A new defence co-operation agreement with Britain is to be signed soon. Members of the House of Lords are saying it will mean a stronger defence relationship between Ireland and the UK. The Taoiseach himself has said there must be very close co-operation with the British when it comes to security. Does he really think that is what Irish people want? Has he forgotten that our neutrality originates from an anti-imperialist struggle against Britain, a struggle Fianna Fáll once fought for? Can he tell us what will be in this new military agreement? Britain is increasing its military expenditure by £67.7 billion. It is an active participant in the genocide in Gaza. Are we going to be expected to massively increase our military expenditure, too, as part of this new agreement? \n The Taoiseach  I thank all of the Deputies for raising a range of issues. Deputy Smith was the first to raise the issue of legacy. I believe there is a sincere commitment on behalf of the British Government as to the implementation of the legacy framework. That is shared by Prime Minister Starmer and, indeed, Secretary of State Hilary Benn, who has acted honourably in all of the negotiations and discussions in respect of the legacy framework. I visited Chequers last September specifically on legacy, along with other issues. It was important to meet with Keir Starmer on that. He has experience of the North from a former role there.  I know the Deputy has been a strong advocate on Belturbet and Monaghan and Dublin. From our perspective, it is important that the Denton report may shed some light on the Monaghan bombing and related issues Deputy Ó Murchú raised. This is relevant also to the activities of the Glennane gang and we eagerly await its publication. Operation Kenova was quite good, in my view, particularly in terms of the victims, who were very impressed with Jon Boutcher when he was in charge of Kenova. They articulated to me that he was one of the first people they met who understood where the families of the victims are coming from.  Deputy Moynihan also raised legacy. We have responsibilities in our jurisdiction. If assertions are made about us, we need to robustly deal with them, but the most effective way to do it is to make sure we respond properly to legacy. As part of the framework agreement, the British Government has, with speed, produced its legislation. That demonstrates the seriousness with which it is approaching this essential work. We are also producing legislation once the UK legislation is enacted. The Minister, Deputy O'Callaghan, has said he is hopeful the general scheme of the Bill will be published in April or May of next year. Enabling reciprocal co-operation between the two jurisdictions is at the heart of the agreed joint framework on legacy.  Additionally, as part of the joint framework agreement, the Garda Commissioner has agreed to the establishment by the end of this year of a dedicated unit as a central point of contact in relation to Troubles-related investigations undertaken by An Garda Síochána. That is an important step forward. Unionist communities in the North have always had a view. We did the Smithwick tribunal and we dealt with it quickly as part of the commitment of earlier agreements, but we do also have to be upfront in terms of the legacy framework and respond properly and comprehensively in relation to that.  I say to Deputy Ó Murchú and all those concerned about legacy that it is not about British state violence alone. It is about that, but it is also about the role of the paramilitaries, such as the Provisional IRA. I have met families of victims who have had no closure at all in terms of atrocities committed by the Provisional IRA or the Ulster loyalist groups. The focus has to be broad-based. There is an opportunity in this legacy framework to give closure to families once and for all, after decades of a lack of closure.  Deputy Coppinger raised the issue of Saoirse Wagner and asked me to talk to the Queen's University authorities. The right to protest is sacrosanct. A number of Deputies have raised this issue. Sometimes protests impede other people from doing their normal work, which is a problem. People are entitled to protest. When the war in Gaza started, I was addressing a group of 100 law students, but the objective of a protest was to stop me and to interfere with the exercise and engagement with about 100 law students. People were shouting internally, security asked them to leave and eventually they did. I was in no doubt that the whole purpose was that I would not have that engagement. Where is the balance of rights there in terms of my freedom to speak as a public representative or the freedom of people in the community to hear me? A lot of protests have crossed the line, in my opinion, with a view to stopping things happening. During a consultative forum on security challenges that I hosted as Minister for foreign affairs two years ago, the protests at that were not about protests. They were deliberately calculated to disrupt the event. \n Deputy Paul Murphy  The forum was not about consultation either, was it? \n The Taoiseach  It was a legitimate consultation. If the Deputy believes in freedom of assembly and freedom of speech, what he and like-minded people were about was stopping that from even happening.  They never complain about that. It is fair play for them to do that. There is balance here. \n Deputy Ruth Coppinger  I do not know about the protest. \n The Taoiseach  Of course the Deputy knows about the protests. She knows all about them. \n Deputy Ruth Coppinger  I have no idea what the Taoiseach is on about. \n The Taoiseach  They were on the public television, for God's sake. \n Deputy Ruth Coppinger  I do not organise every protest in Ireland. \n The Taoiseach  They were on the public television, in the media and everywhere. In this House----- \n Deputy Paul Murphy  That does not make it terrorism. \n The Taoiseach  -----assertions were made. I am not calling it that. \n An Ceann Comhairle  The Deputies are only delaying the next question. \n The Taoiseach  The point I am illustrating is that there are different forms of protest on the continuum and some of those forms are unacceptable----- \n Deputy Ruth Coppinger  We did not organise----- \n An Ceann Comhairle  Deputy, stop engaging, please. \n The Taoiseach  -----as an infringement of the rights of people generally. That is the point I am making. \n An Ceann Comhairle  The time has elapsed. \n Deputy Ruth Coppinger  I am just correcting a mistruth there. \n The Taoiseach  It is not a one-way street----- \n An Ceann Comhairle  It does not matter. \n The Taoiseach  -----all of the time. That is the point I am making. Ramming gates at Shannon Airport is not a legitimate form of protest. Stopping trade through Dublin Port is not a legitimate form of protest----- \n Deputy Ruth Coppinger  We are not. \n The Taoiseach  -----because people's livelihood depends on it. Eighty per cent of trade in this country goes through Dublin Port. Having a problem with a company is not a justification, in my view, for disrupting the entire port. I have no problem having a debate. I participated in protests as a student. I think student protests are important. \n Deputy Ruth Coppinger  Did you? \n An Ceann Comhairle  This is not a debate. \n The Taoiseach  I did, actually \n Deputy Ruth Coppinger  Okay, I will look that one up. \n The Taoiseach  The Deputy can do that. Joe Duffy was put in prison as a result of that protest. It was to do with medical cards. There you are now. Students in this country automatically had medical cards at one time. That was taken away in the eighties. The point is that legitimate protests----- \n Deputy Ruth Coppinger  Which party was that? \n An Ceann Comhairle  Ah please, Deputy, we have to get through this. \n The Taoiseach  I think it was the Deputy's former colleagues in the Labour Party. \n An Ceann Comhairle  Taoiseach, are we moving on? \n The Taoiseach  That is history. Protests happen, and I have no issue with that, but there is a continuum. I will take the Ceann Comhairle's advice.  To Deputy Ó Murchú, I have dealt with some of the legacy issues, which Deputy Conway-Walsh also raised. I will talk to Queen's University on that point. In terms of the Dundalk bombing and the Glennane gang, I hope Operation Denton will shed light on that. \n Deputy Peadar Tóibín  What about the health services? \n The Taoiseach  I will come to that. On Deputy Boyd Barrett's question, there is no relationship between the strategy and policy of the Israeli Government and my views on the renaming of Herzog Park. I have a very basic view. Throughout the history of the State, there have been namings and renamings. I am, and have been, a student of history and I taught students. I always showed them that the names of parks could be the remnants of empire or anything, but they are windows to explain the history of a given subject or personality. If we keep shutting down everything that is named after somebody, there will be no history left. \n Deputy Paul Murphy  When was it named Herzog Park? \n The Taoiseach  There will not be a history left. \n Deputy Paul Murphy  When was it named Herzog Park? It was ten or 20 years ago. \n An Ceann Comhairle  Please move on, Taoiseach. \n The Taoiseach  That is not the point. \n Deputy Paul Murphy  That is not history. \n The Taoiseach  It is, actually, if you go back through his father and before that and examine how Jewish communities came to Ireland in the first instance. There is huge history there, for God's sake. \n Deputy Paul Murphy  But not the park. \n An Ceann Comhairle  Deputy----- \n Deputy Paul Murphy  It is still history if you change the name of the park. \n The Taoiseach  As a historian and someone who is interested in history, I would be very careful. \n An Ceann Comhairle  -----you are verging on disruptive. \n The Taoiseach  Breandán Ó hEithir wrote in Lig Sinn i gCathú about the thirties when places were being shut down left, right and centre. \n An Ceann Comhairle  Seven more Deputies, Taoiseach. \n The Taoiseach  There is a lot more to it than that, but it has nothing to do with this. I can put Deputy Boyd Barrett at ease in that regard. \n An Ceann Comhairle  There are seven more Deputies to answer, Taoiseach. \n The Taoiseach  By the way, I object, like the Deputy does, to Israel's consistent messaging that if you are not onside, you are offside or antisemitic. That is wrong. You are entitled to be against Israeli Government policy and criticise it and not be labelled antisemitic. That is absolutely correct and I support it.  Deputy Tóibín should talk to his former colleagues in Sinn Féin in earnest and engage with them on the health services in Northern Ireland. That is one issue. There are broader problems with the National Health Service generally, but there are real issues in Northern Ireland. There is no question about the pressures on the health service there. \n Deputy Peadar Tóibín  There are benefits to an all-Ireland health service. \n An Ceann Comhairle  Deputy, this is not a continuous back-and-forth. I am not allowing that. This is Taoiseach's Questions. The Deputy has asked a question and is getting an answer. \n The Taoiseach  Under the shared island initiative, we are trying to do specific projects and programmes, for example in paediatric and cardiovascular health, cardiac surgery and the cancer centre at Altnagelvin hospital. Those are good programmes that have worked very well.  Deputy Quaide referred to Prime Minister Starmer. I do not see him as an authoritarian person when I meet him. I spoke about the continuum of protest. I am not au fait with British security services or why they came to do what they did in respect of Palestine Action. We have proceeded differently in this country. When I meet Prime Minister Starmer, I will have an opportunity to deal fundamentally with a range of issues although we cannot deal with every single issue. The UK has had challenges on both sides of the political spectrum in respect of protests and the nature of those protests.  I dealt with the points raised by Deputy Shane Moynihan about Operation Denton. The Sudan issue is one I have raised consistently with leaders, including publicly, at the G20 summit and at the Africa-European Union summit. It is catastrophic. It rarely gets mentioned in this House, but 12 million people have been displaced. Genocide against the civilian population is happening there. Some of the rebel forces are being supported by neighbouring countries with arms and so forth.  To respond to Deputy Conway-Walsh, the framework is Article 2 compliant. It is far stronger than its predecessor as a legacy Bill.  Deputy Murphy raised the new co-operation agreement. It absolutely makes sense that we co-operate very closely with the United Kingdom on the gas connectors, for example. Those are a huge security vulnerability for both the UK and Ireland, but particularly for Ireland. Within a week, our economy would come to a standstill if anything untoward were to happen to those interconnectors. I hope the Deputy would agree that we should have close defence co-operation for our economic security, in particular, and for our subsea cables. That will mean a lot of technological co-operation. When a Russian shadow fleet crosses over those pipes or subsea cables, very often divers have to go down and check that the pipes are okay. That is co-operation. Letting people know that somebody who might be up to not good is in your terrain is co-operation. Intelligence services sharing information about terrorists or potential attacks is co-operation. There should be no big deal about co-operation.  By the way, on the origin of our neutrality, it was not an anti-imperialist origin. In fact, at the consultative forum, there was a very good seminar on our neutrality and its origins. Obviously, the Second World War was at the core. We were neutral in not having issues with Britain and the occupation of Northern Ireland and so on, but the more fundamental issue was that it was a neutrality of survival. No one was in a position to defend Ireland in 1939, 1940 or 1941. There were good presentations made at that consultative forum but Deputy Murphy boycotted it because he felt it was not worthwhile. It would have been informative had he gone. It would have provided a more nuanced view----- \n Deputy Paul Murphy  It is a shame the Taoiseach scrapped the idea of a citizens' assembly. \n The Taoiseach  -----of the origins of our neutrality. \n An Ceann Comhairle  I thank the Taoiseach and ask him to move to the next question. \n The Taoiseach  I apologise. I thank the Ceann Comhairle for her tolerance. \n An Ceann Comhairle  It is not my tolerance. I get complaints at the Business Committee that this forum is not working. We are going to take it to the Dáil reform committee for change. ",

        "answerText": " The Taoiseach  Regulation – and the extent of any regulatory or administrative burden – has recently become a greater focus at EU level and nationally as a means to further enhance competitiveness.  At an EU level, both simplification and implementation are important Commission priorities. The Commission is striving to simplify and lighten the administrative burden of EU regulations to ensure they are proportionate, stable, coherent, and technology neutral.  Likewise, our national regulatory framework is a central focus for Government as we strive to support competitiveness at a time of international economic uncertainty.  In line with the Programme for Government, we published an Action Plan on Competitiveness and Productivity on the 10th of September this year.  The Action Plan includes actions across Government to ensure development of a more effective regulatory system which will support economic growth.  These actions reflect priority areas where targeted public policy intervention can have the greatest impact. These include:  •\ta red tape challenge to reduce regulation for SMEs;  •\tapplication of the SME test by Government Departments to all measures, in particular to policy initiatives where it is proposed to increase costs on small business;  •\texpediting the Environment Miscellaneous Provisions Bill;  •\tcommencing reforms under the Planning and Development Act 2024 to enhance delivery of infrastructure; and  •\timplementing the outstanding recommendations from the Review of the Administration of Civil Justice: Review Group Report.  The actions are framed to align with national strategic objectives and ensure that Ireland’s regulatory system is equipped to deliver good long-term economic and social outcomes.  There is already much activity underway to reduce the regulatory burden across Government.  For example, the Minister for Enterprise, Tourism and Employment is undertaking a programme of work with his agencies to simplify and streamline processes and reduce duplication to eliminate unnecessary administrative burdens on businesses.  We have established a Cost of Business Advisory Forum where business owners and representative bodies can speak directly to decision-makers about the real-world impact of regulations, fees, and operational challenges. The work of the Forum is underway.  Increased regulatory burden has also been identified as a barrier to infrastructure development and delivery. Minister Chambers, supported by the work of the Accelerating Infrastructure Taskforce, is this week publishing a Plan which will include extensive regulatory reforms aimed at accelerating delivery of critical infrastructure.  Minister McEntee, in the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, together with relevant Departments, has been engaging with the simplification Omnibus packages put forward by the Commission on a range of policy areas, most recently the Commission’s digital simplification Omnibus package published last week.  As outlined in the Action Plan on Competitiveness and Productivity, my Department will play a coordinating role across these different regulatory reform initiatives, including the establishment of a central Economic Regulators Forum.  In taking forward this work, my Department will work with the Department of Enterprise, Tourism and Employment and other Departments to identify further areas of focus for regulatory reform in the time ahead.

My Department is currently working with other Government Departments to develop this strategy with the aim to publish it in 2026. The strategy will consider the international student sector.  International students from outside the EU/EEA are granted a permission on Stamp 2 conditions where they have enrolled on, and commenced a course listed on the Interim List of Eligible Programmes (ILEP), or eligible programmes offered by providers with authorisation to use the new TrustEd Education mark awarded by the Quality and Qualifications Ireland (QQI).  Currently, information regarding the educational institution a person is attending is recorded on each individual person’s file and is not available in a manner which allows detailed data to be extracted in the manner sought by the Deputy.  The table below details the number of people granted a student immigration permission from 2020 to 2024. Figures for 2025 are not yet available.     Year    Number of Stamp 2 Registrations      2020    30,980      2021    28,717      2022    52,845      2023    60,882      2024    60,901     * Figures are correct at time of issue however all statistics may be subject to data cleansing  ** Numbers reflect those required to register/renew in a calendar year. Most renewals are annual. However, there may be students that were required to register/renew multiple times in the same calendar year. These numbers per year should not be summed to an overall total but rather reflect the number required to register/renew in that calendar year.  ILEP is being superseded by TrustEd Ireland, the international education mark launched in September 2024 by Quality and Qualifications Ireland (QQI) and the Department of Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science. TrustEd Ireland is a new statutory quality mark and part of a suite of legislative measures designed to further protect international learners.  Once the ILEP is discontinued, only education providers granted authorisation to use the TrustEd Ireland mark will be eligible to recruit students from outside the EEA to English language programmes, foundation programmes and higher education programmes leading to awards within the National Framework of Qualifications (NFQ).  The new mark will be awarded to higher education and English language education providers who have demonstrated that they meet national standards to ensure a quality experience for international learners from pre-enrolment through to the completion of their programme of education and training. Applications are currently being reviewed for the first application cycle, which closed in March 2025. Decisions are scheduled to issue in January 2026. ",

The Cabinet subcommittee on Northern Ireland was created on 18 February 2025 to oversee implementation of relevant programme for Government commitments and ongoing developments in relation to Northern Ireland, Irish-British relations, and the shared island initiative. As well as considering issues relevant to the Government's position as a co-guarantor of the Good Friday Agreement, including our role in Good Friday Agreement institutions such as the North-South Ministerial Council, the British-Irish Council and the British-Irish Intergovernmental Conference, topics for discussion also include the annual UK-Ireland summits and their agreed programme of work and the continued roll-out and development of the investment, research and dialogue strands of the shared island initiative.  On 17 October, I chaired the 30th plenary meeting of the North-South Ministerial Council in Farmleigh House, Dublin. The Northern Ireland Executive was led by the First Minister, Michelle O'Neill, MLA, and the deputy First Minister, Emma Little-Pengelly, MLA. We had constructive discussions on areas of mutual issues, including business and trade matters, infrastructure and investment co-operation, and tackling gender-based violence. Our discussion also included a new agenda item on emergency planning and preparedness. We also had updates by all Ministers on North-South co-operation under their portfolios, ranging from day-to-day cross-Border engagement to major infrastructural projects. The event was preceded by a dinner at Farmleigh with Government and Northern Ireland Ministers on 16 October.  On 18 November, the Government announced allocations of over €50 million from the shared island fund for ten new projects to be delivered as part of the initiative over 2026 to 2030. Among the projects are €14 million for a major new shared island media initiative to be taken forward by Coimisiún na Meán, €5.9 million to develop cross-Border emergency management capacity on flood response and rescue operations, particularly with resources for technology and so forth, and €2 million to enable a new Dublin-Derry PSO air service to start in 2026.  Next week, along with the Tánaiste, I will attend a summit meeting of the British-Irish Council in Wales where the focus of our discussions will be on the creative industries across these islands. The Cabinet committee on Northern Ireland will continue to meet biannually on these and related matters. We will be meeting again next on 8 December. \n An Ceann Comhairle  I ask Members to please be brief and concise, as the Taoiseach needs to respond. \n Deputy Brendan Smith  I thank the Taoiseach for his reply. As he is aware, there was a general welcome for the legacy framework that was published jointly by the Irish and British Governments in early September. Could he let us know what progress is being made in bringing forward the necessary legislation to enact that framework and to ensure that all of these issues are dealt with through putting the victims first and at the centre of the framework and the modus operandi of dealing with these legacy issues?  Another thing I have consistently raised is the Belturbet bombing of December 1972 and the Dublin-Monaghan bombings of 1974. Again, the British Government has not co-operated to the extent necessary to ensure a comprehensive investigation into the Dublin-Monaghan bombings. Will the Taoiseach let us know if that will continue to be on the agenda in all discussions at Government level with his British counterparts? \n Deputy Erin McGreehan  I would like the Taoiseach to outline whether the Cabinet committee discussed the cross-Border economy, particularly in counties such as Louth where these issues are felt most acutely. Will there be specific actions in relation to tax and administrative complications facing cross-Border workers, including the differentiations between the pricing of alcohol and fuel between both jurisdictions and the impact of that in the distortion of local trade and the undermining of businesses and broader communities?  I support my colleague Deputy Smith in relation to the bombings. I also highlight that it will have been 50 years this December since the Dundalk bombing where people tragically lost their lives. \n Deputy Barry Heneghan  Regarding the cross-Border organisation Foras na Gaeilge, if it had the same growth as the Arts Council, Foras na Gaeilge's budget would now be €50 million. Instead of that, níl sé ach €17 milliún. I welcome the raise in the recent budget to Foras na Gaeilge's funding, but how will the Taoiseach ensure that this additional funding is made available, given that 25% of it is from the North? \n Deputy Ruairí Ó Murchú  I have often brought up the positives regarding the shared island unit. I believe the project in relation to DkIT and its partnership with Queen's University Belfast could fit into that. However, a number of other issues arise, whether we are talking about the remote working issues that have an impact on taxation or exam certification. In fairness to Deputy McGreehan, she has brought up the issue of the disparity regarding fuel. I have spoken before about the need for some sort of means of putting these issues on the agenda properly and dealing with them.  We have made the call for a long time to get down to the issue of constitutional change and the need for a means - call it a citizens' assembly or a forum - by which this conversation can happen. The State must properly prepare for Irish unity. There has been an abject failure to do so and we cannot just wait until everybody gets on together. We need to prepare now and the onus is on the State to do it. \n Deputy Cormac Devlin  I thank the Taoiseach for the update on the work of the Cabinet subcommittee. As Cathaoirleach of the Committee on the Implementation of the Good Friday Agreement, we have had good engagements North and South. That is continuing next week with visiting MPs from Westminster. Dialogue is important in terms of the Government's good relationship with London as well as Belfast.  May I also raise the case of the 265 students and teachers who were kidnapped in Niger state in Nigeria? It is a very serious case and I would like to know what is happening there. \n Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett  Last week, I raised with the Taoiseach - I want to do so again because it is important - the fact that, as part of a wider attack by the British Government on those standing in solidarity with the people of Palestine and against Israel's genocide in Gaza, people in the North are being arrested and charged, including one of our councillors, Councillor Shaun Harkin in Derry, for indicating supporting support for Palestine Action. The designation by the Starmer Government of Palestine Action as a terrorist group is outrageous when what the group has been trying to do is stop Israeli terrorism and genocide by trying to disrupt the ability of the British state and Israeli companies to collaborate with Israel in the genocidal assault on the people of Palestine. It is happening in the North. Arrests are taking place. There was a protest this weekend where people declared their support for Palestine Action. It should not be a chargeable offence and the Taoiseach should speak out against it. \n Deputy Paul Murphy  For 15 months, an Irish citizen from County Antrim has been held without trial in an English prison and has had his rights denied. Jordan Devlin is being locked inside for 23 and a half hours per day. He is being strip searched twice daily. His mail has been withheld, his visits are blocked and his calls are denied. His sister said, \"They put him on public protection so he can't speak to anyone\". She also said:  They often don’t have vegetarian food so he can't eat. They're x-raying him and strip-searching him twice a day. He's freezing too.  He is a Palestine solidarity activist. He is charged with regard to a protest action at Elbit Systems. Elbit is the largest supplier of weapons to the Israeli genocide. He denies all the charges. His trial begins today but his judge was swapped out yesterday with no stated justification. The question is whether the Irish Government has made any representations on his behalf and whether the Taoiseach has sought to ensure that his basic rights as a prisoner and a defendant are defended as opposed to being ridden roughshod over like many other Palestine protesters. \n Deputy Ivana Bacik  I thank the Taoiseach for the update. I welcome the developments with the shared island fund. It is now clearer than it has ever been that conversations about the constitutional future of the island are picking up steam. I would dispute the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland's recent claim that there was no appetite for constitutional change in Northern Ireland. I see that the leader of the SDLP Claire Hanna and others contested that claim. In the absence of leadership from the British Government and in keeping with the principles in the Good Friday Agreement-Belfast Agreement, it is essential for our Government to take on a role of preparing in earnest for the work necessary to lay the groundwork and foundations for running a referendum on unity. We need a clear timeline to allow for that necessary groundwork to take place, to develop Green and White Papers, to allow for the work of citizens' assemblies to take place and to see progress made building on the work of the shared island unit in advance of the 30th anniversary of the Good Friday Agreement-Belfast Agreement. The Taoiseach said that the next meeting of the Cabinet subcommittee would be on 8 December. As we approach 2028, what substantive steps will that Cabinet subcommittee be announcing in terms of bringing the debate further? \n Deputy Rose Conway-Walsh  At last week's session of the Committee on the Implementation of the Good Friday Agreement, we had a profound contribution from the All-Island Cancer Research Institute and the All-Island Congenital Heart Disease Network. It highlighted once again what we have known for some time, namely, that lives can be saved and healthcare can only be delivered to an optimum level across the island when we have an all-island approach to healthcare for the 7 million people living on the island. It makes zero sense on a small island such as ours financially or otherwise to have two healthcare systems operating simultaneously. Until such time as we have a referendum on Irish unity and an opportunity to design a new and modern all-island, world-class service, I ask the Taoiseach and the Minister for Health to set aside a permanent allocation in the health budget for the delivery of healthcare on an all-island basis, utilising North-South collaboration to improve outcomes for patients in both jurisdictions and maximise the wonderful clinical expertise on the island. \n Deputy Eoin Hayes  The renewed calls for a border poll on reunification in recent months point to a definite direction of travel on the issue of a united Ireland and on that question moving from the realm of the idealistic to the practical. My party and I would welcome the opportunity to advocate for reunification and believe that a united Ireland achieved by truly informed communities North and South in a process defined by consent and deliberative consensus has the real potential to benefit the people of the entire island. However, I am concerned that as the chances of a border poll in the next ten or 15 years continue to rise to that of political inevitability, we are running out of time to ensure it takes place in such an environment. Will the Government commit to the establishment of citizens' assemblies, work towards cross-Border fora on health, economics and education and set out a positive vision? \n Deputy Peadar Tóibín  The purpose of the British legacy Bill was to grant to amnesty to those who had killed innocent civilians. There appears to be a significant contradiction in the position of the Irish and British Governments in the new joint framework that seeks to replace that. The British Government is briefing that there will be safeguards for British army veterans. I asked Simon Harris this question and he said that was separate from the joint framework and that the British were looking for their own safeguards in their own legislation. Would that separate treatment for British army veterans not undermine a joint framework? Would it not create a lop-sided justice system in the Six Counties? Will that protection for veterans apply to both sides of the conflict? Will the British secretary of state retain a veto over the disclosure of the role of paid British agents in the Troubles and will former RUC officers who played a significant role in the Troubles be part of the investigative system that is put in place? \n Deputy Conor D. McGuinness  Tá Coimisinéir Teanga nua ceaptha sna Sé Chontae, Pól Deeds. Is coiscéim chun tosaigh é seo i ndiaidh tréimhse an-fhada ag feitheamh dá leithéid. Tá Gaeilge agus pobal na Gaeilge faoi ionsaí sna Sé Chontae faoi láthair. Conas a dhéanfaidh an Taoiseach cosaint ar an bpobal seo, ar lucht labhartha na Gaeilge ó Thuaidh?  While I am on my feet, I want to raise the situation of Jordan Devlin, an Irish citizen from County Antrim who is on remand in Britain awaiting charges relating to pro-Palestinian activism there. I see this in the wider context of a crackdown on political dissent and political protest in Britain. Has the Taoiseach raised, or will he raise, this situation with the British authorities to ensure he is treated fairly in prison and will be afforded a fair trial? \n The Taoiseach  I thank all of the Deputies for raising a variety of issues. Deputy Brendan Smith was first up. In respect of the legacy framework, the measures announced in the joint framework were published in September and provide a pathway to truth and accountability. That is why I went to London to meet Keir Starmer. It was one of those trips. I take it that people accept that we have to go to London every now and again to meet the Prime Minister. It was to make sure we got the legacy Bill over the line because it is an important piece of legislation that is certainly far superior to the previous legacy Act of the last British Government.  The British Government published the Bill amending the 2023 legacy Act on 14 October, so that is the progress the Deputy was asking for. The second reading of that Bill took place in the House of Commons on 18 November. To be fair, we believe that represents speed and demonstrates the seriousness with which they are approaching this essential work. The key test for us will be whether it faithfully reflects what is in the joint framework. The Minister, Deputy McEntee, and the UK secretary of state, Hilary Benn, discussed the legacy framework in their introductory call last week.  The Tánaiste and the Minister, Deputy O'Callaghan, also discussed this with the secretary of state, Mr. Benn, at the British-Irish Intergovernmental Conference, which took place on 17 November because we, too, have responsibilities in this jurisdiction. While we can only legislate once the UK legislation is enacted, the Minister for justice, Jim O'Callaghan, has said he is hopeful that the general scheme of the Bill will be published in April or May of next year. Enabling reciprocal co-operation between the two jurisdictions is absolutely at the heart of the agreed joint framework on legacy. The Garda Commissioner is also committed to the establishment by the end of this year of a dedicated unit as a central point of contact in relation to Troubles-related investigations undertaken by An Garda Síochána. That is also in the joint framework. An Garda Síochána has also committed, where possible, to answer questions that a family may have in relation to the investigation of a Troubles-related incident and provide a report to the family.  In respect of the Belturbet and Dublin-Monaghan bombings, the publication of the Denton report may very well shed light on the Dublin-Monaghan bombings. We have to await the outcome of that. I know it is into the Glenanne Gang and the atrocities they perpetrated, but that will be important. I know that Deputy Smith has been a strong advocate on the Belturbet and Dublin-Monaghan bombings.  Deputy McGreehan raised a very important point about the treatment for tax purposes of workers who cross the Border. We do not have that resolved yet. There have been ongoing issues, or attempts to do that, between the respective Departments of finance and I am pushing through the cross-Border bodies and through the Department of Finance to get some progress on that. We are also working with employers and unions through the LEEF process to see can we make progress on it. It is an issue for the seamless transfer of workers North to South and South to North.  It is more difficult in terms of harmonisation of prices North and South. Different Governments have different policies. I have not seen today's budget in respect of the UK yet but that could even bring in more taxation. We do not know how that will manifest.  I am conscious also that it is 50 years since the Dundalk bombing.  Maidir le ceist an Teachta Heneghan, tá deacracht ann toisc an gaol atá ann. Tá dualgas ar an Executive airgead a chur ar fáil d’Fhoras na Gaeilge agus caithfimid an rud céanna a dhéanamh. Is féidir linn níos mó a chur ar fáil. Trí shared island, tá níos mó á dhéanamh againn, maraon leis an méid atá ag teacht go hoifigiúil ón Rialtas, chun gnóthaí trí Ghaeilge a chothú agus tacaíocht a thabhairt. Mar sin beimid ag déanamh sin. I will come back to the shared island initiative later.  Deputy Ó Murchú and others raised constitutional issues and so on. I think reconciliation cannot be postponed, Deputy. \n Deputy Ruairí Ó Murchú  I did not say it could be. \n The Taoiseach  The Deputy kind of said we could not wait. \n Deputy Ruairí Ó Murchú  The Taoiseach said waiting on a perfect----- \n The Taoiseach  I know. I am not trying to----- \n Deputy Ruairí Ó Murchú  He said we wait on a perfect----- \n An Ceann Comhairle  Deputy, please. The Taoiseach is answering the questions. \n The Taoiseach  I just think we need to really focus on reconciliation on a constant, constant basis. \n Deputy Ruairí Ó Murchú  That is okay. \n The Taoiseach  It is hard work but it does bear great fruit in terms of the North and South and different traditions and political backgrounds within the North as well. \n Deputy Peadar Tóibín  It is more likely to happen in a united Ireland. \n An Ceann Comhairle  Deputy, this is not a back and forth. \n The Taoiseach  It is very important that we consistently do that. I do not think citizens' assemblies are in any shape or form an appropriate route for discussing the future of Ireland or the constitutional framework into the future. \n Deputy Ruairí Ó Murchú  In a forum. \n Deputy Peadar Tóibín  The New Ireland Forum. \n The Taoiseach  I just do not believe it at all, because anyone who knows anything about the North - and I have been involved all my life politically; I have been involved in discussions about the devolution of justice, for example, and I was in the Government when the Good Friday Agreement was first signed - knows it means people-to-people engagement. It means political parties engaging. It means political traditions as well as independent politicians or people who have a view. Citizens' assemblies can be closed enough in some respects and they can be a percentage of a random percentage of the population. There were some good citizens' assemblies but for something as overarching as a future constitutional framework - I just want to give my view on this - from my experience, it simply would not cut it. You would end up with a report----- \n Deputy Peadar Tóibín  The New Ireland Forum. \n Deputy Ruairí Ó Murchú  Then come up with an alternative. \n An Ceann Comhairle  Sorry, there is a structure on this debate. \n The Taoiseach  What I am always amused by----- \n Deputy Peadar Tóibín  We are just giving suggestions. \n An Ceann Comhairle  It is not allowed. \n The Taoiseach  Fianna Fáil as a party has committed to the North with great substance over the years - Charles Haughey, Albert Reynolds and Bertie Ahern in terms of the Good Friday Agreement. In this Government and the last, we did something that has never been done in the shared island initiative. Some €1 billion from 2020 to 2025 and beyond and another €1 billion in this programme for Government, which is bringing real substance. Instead of all the rhetoric and everything else, we are doing things. Part of that has also been a very important investment in real research into the different systems North and South - into our health systems, into education completion, into energy, into enterprise, and into ecology and climate. Good stuff has been done by the Economic and Social Research Institute. I defy the Deputies to go back over the last 100 years and come up with anything that parallels the level of research we have undertaken to try to understand better the different systems and different approaches.  Now, I will put a challenge to Sinn Féin. It has been talking about this for decades but it has not produced a scrap of paper in terms of----- \n Deputy Ruairí Ó Murchú  That is not true. \n Deputy Rose Conway-Walsh  That is not true. \n The Taoiseach  One second, please. I am just trying to make a point. \n Deputy Rose Conway-Walsh  Yes, but it is not the truth. \n An Ceann Comhairle  It is not a back and forth. \n Deputy Rose Conway-Walsh  Do not tell untruths. \n The Taoiseach  In terms of a blueprint, why is Sinn Féin afraid to bring forward a blueprint? \n Deputy Rose Conway-Walsh  You are the Taoiseach. \n An Ceann Comhairle  There are seven other Deputies, Taoiseach. \n Deputy Rose Conway-Walsh  You are the leader. \n The Taoiseach  I know. \n An Ceann Comhairle  It is not a back and forth. \n The Taoiseach  We are taking our responses in terms of the Good Friday Agreement. \n Deputy Conor D. McGuinness  You lead the Government. \n The Taoiseach  I believe in the unity of the Irish people, okay,----- \n An Ceann Comhairle  Seven other Deputies, Taoiseach. \n The Taoiseach  -----but I would say to the Deputies that with everything Sinn Féin does, the onus is on the Government. The Government will take its responsibilities in relation to this but----- \n Deputy David Cullinane  I have brought forward a plan for healthcare. I will send it on to you. \n The Taoiseach  -----fo a party I would have thought was so committed as Sinn Féin is rhetorically - it keeps going on about it - it has produced very little in terms of what it believes the blueprint should be. \n Deputy Rose Conway-Walsh  We have done several studies. \n An Ceann Comhairle  Just to remind----- \n The Taoiseach  That is the point I would make----- \n Deputy Ruairí Ó Murchú  And we have engaged. \n The Taoiseach  -----because the party always wants us to produce the blueprint. \n Deputy Ruairí Ó Murchú  That is because we are not in power. \n The Taoiseach  By the way, Fianna Fáil will not be found wanting, nor will other parties, in terms of delivering substance in respect of this issue. \n Deputy Ruairí Ó Murchú  You are the Government. \n An Ceann Comhairle  Taoiseach, just to remind you there are seven other Deputies. \n The Taoiseach  That is covering all the seven really. There are a good few----- \n Deputy Peadar Tóibín  But it is not getting us anywhere. \n An Ceann Comhairle  No, the next seven, including Deputy Boyd Barrett. \n The Taoiseach  Deputy Devlin made a very important point and he has done very good work as Chair of the Good Friday committee. I certainly think he is correct in respect of what has happened in Nigeria. At the European Union-African Union Summit, that was raised in terms of what Boko Haram and various jihadist groups were doing in terms of the persecution and killing of many people, but Christians as well, and the kidnapping of young girls and so on. I appreciate the point the Deputy raised there.  To Deputy Boyd Barrett on the issues around Palestine Action, all of our embassies and so on provide whatever consular supports to any Irish citizen who is on remand or in prison. We always provide whatever supports we can or whatever assistance but we do not and obviously cannot interfere in the criminal justice system. I will review the case of Jordan Devlin and I will ask again our ambassador in London for an update in respect of that. \n Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett  You should speak out against Starmer's policy. \n An Ceann Comhairle  Please, Deputy. \n Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett  It is a disgraceful policy. \n The Taoiseach  I have no issue with people - obviously, I do not - supporting Palestinians. I do have an issue - I am not saying this happened in these cases at all because I do not know the full detail of them - but I read recently of a case where there was a ramming of building in London, so it is not as black and white as the Deputy has articulated, or even here where people drive through gates and barriers and do criminal damage. TDs' offices have had criminal damage by, I would say, more extreme elements of people who were involved in supporting the Palestinian movement, unfortunately. It is true. My own office was damaged three times. I know other TDs whose offices were damaged. \n Deputy Erin McGreehan  Hear, hear. \n The Taoiseach  So, is that acceptable? Is that legitimate protest? No, it is not. When there are people working in those offices, they do not think it is legitimate. All I am saying is we all have to be clear on the demarcation line. I am not familiar with the individual cases here in terms of the alleged crimes and so on like that, but let us not try to pretend that everything is just all one way because----- \n Deputy Paul Murphy  But in Britain, if you just hold a sign saying \"Free Palestine Action\", you can be arrested. \n An Ceann Comhairle  Please, Deputy Murphy. \n The Taoiseach  -----one thing I do know----- \n Deputy Paul Murphy  That is crazy. \n An Ceann Comhairle  This is orchestrated. I ask you to stop interrupting. \n The Taoiseach  One thing I do know is either on the far right or the far left, people do transgress the lines and let us not pretend they do not. They have in this country in the past. There clearly are other issues in the UK----- \n Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett  I think you will find the Israelis are the transgressors. \n The Taoiseach  -----and so on like that. Look, some people were trying to stop Dublin Port the other day. \n Deputy Paul Murphy  And they got bashed, did they not? \n An Ceann Comhairle  Taoiseach, I do not know if you intend to take any other questions. \n Deputy Paul Murphy  They got battered by gardaí, did they not? \n The Taoiseach  Well, they should not be trying to stop----- \n Deputy Paul Murphy  Did the Taoiseach support the gardaí battering them? \n The Taoiseach  Some 80% of trade in this country goes through Dublin Port and you guys want to wreck it. That is bread on the table. Workers all over the country depend on trade going through Dublin Port. As far as the Deputies are concerned, that should be stopped in its tracks. There are demarcation lines that we have to be very clear about. The right to protest----- \n Deputy Paul Murphy  They were protesting trade with Israel. \n The Taoiseach  -----is a sacred right in this country. We should cherish that and we should never do anything to damage it, nor should others.  I think I have dealt with the issue Deputy Bacik raised in my general response. I do not believe a citizens' assembly is the right way to go.  Deputy Conway-Walsh spoke about the cancer consortium. I helped to set that up originally. We are supporting it. On congenital heart disease, there was a very good agreement and there are cross-Border health initiatives including, for example, an initiative to treat children's hearts in Crumlin. There is more we can do. There is a cancer centre at Altnagelvin. I do not know if the Deputy has seen that. The Republic provided a lot of funding for that. There are also other services. I am all for that. We are researching whether we can provide better primary care services North and South and whether hospital resources can be combined. Deputy McGreehan made a point to me about two hospitals, one of which was Daisy Hill Hospital, where more stuff could be done. We have been working on that through various initiatives. I am all for that. We will continue to do that in conjunction with the ESRI and NESC.  I have given my views on the issue raised by Deputy Eoin Hayes. We have established all-island forums through the shared island initiative. Through that initiative, we have created a climate and biodiversity network, an all-island women's forum and an all-island youth forum where young people get together and talk about the future and about their lives. We have also developed the first all-island music archive, combining music from different traditions in the one archive. That is being funded through the shared island unit. There is a lot happening on the ground. People are just getting together. I was at an event two weeks ago. It was fantastic. People from east Belfast were doing tapestries with people from Inishbofin. Some of them had never been in the Republic before. Some of those from the South had never been in the North. We have a long way to go but we need to do this right and properly.  To respond to Deputy Conor McGuinness, is maith an rud é go bhfuil an coimisinéir teanga nua ann sa Tuaisceart. Tá Acht ann anois. Tá reachtaíocht curtha i láthair. Is dócha go bhfuil an-chuid oibre le déanamh ag an gcoimisinéir chun é sin a chur i bhfeidhm. Níl an reachtaíocht sin lán-cosúil leis an reachtaíocht atá againn anseo. Más féidir linn aon tacaíocht a thabhairt dó agus do ghluaiseacht na Gaeilge sa Tuaisceart, beimid sásta é sin a dhéanamh. Tá a lán déanta againn ach táimid sásta i bhfad níos mó a dhéanamh. \n Deputy Peadar Tóibín  Will the Taoiseach address the lopsided protections for veterans? \n The Taoiseach  Again, they were not negotiated by this Government, nor are they part of the joint framework. It is our understanding that the accommodation made for witnesses should apply in the cases of all victims equally, regardless of the perspective being brought to the matter. \n Deputy Peadar Tóibín  It is a problem then. \n An Ceann Comhairle  The Taoiseach has another 15 minutes. Did he answer Deputy McGuinness's question? \n The Taoiseach  I did. \n An Ceann Comhairle  You did. I am sorry; I was distracted. I would like to welcome a member of the Down's syndrome community, Declan Moran, who is here with Deputy Albert Dolan. You are very welcome, Declan. \n The Taoiseach  You are very welcome, Declan. ",

        "showAs": " 24. Deputy Ivana Bacik asked the Taoiseach if he will report on the programme plan for his Department's new disability unit for 2025-2027. [65263/25] ",
        "answerText": " An Ceann Comhairle  We have 15 to 16 minutes left. There are 20 Deputies to speak on the next question. I propose to divide the time remaining after the Taoiseach's opening statement between a number of Deputies. \n The Taoiseach  It is a brilliant statement. \n An Ceann Comhairle  The Taoiseach will have to try to be brief. \n The Taoiseach  I jest. \n Deputy Peadar Tóibín  It is all in the delivery. \n The Taoiseach  I will try to cut it short to allow others to come in. I propose to take Questions Nos. 14 to 35, inclusive, together.  I established the disability unit in the Department to bring about a renewed focus and urgency and out of a desire to drive progress on disability issues. The unit's first programme plan, published in September, outlines how the unit will drive the delivery of the Government's new national disability strategy, working across government to make the ambitions a reality. In particular, the unit will look to drive innovation, to get things done, to bring momentum to policy implementation, to troubleshoot, where appropriate, to improve the delivery of services, and to get strategic thinking on future challenges. The unit will also support the Cabinet committee on disability.  The first programme plan for the unit outlines ten priority areas for the period from 2025 to 2027 across five workstreams. The first workstream relates to transforming children's disability services, early years education and health. The second is about increasing system capacity and the third is about opening doors and addressing barriers to employment pathways and supports. The fourth relates to implementing the national disability strategy and the fifth is on planning and designing for the future. The programme plan allows for further workstreams to be assigned to the unit as may be needed.  We do not want to duplicate the work of Ministers or Departments but to support them in improving services and getting things done. It is already up and running. The Cabinet committee on disability has met five times to date. With the support of the unit, we have looked at the new national disability strategy. As the House will know, that has gone through and has now been published. The provision of therapists in special schools is up and running. Some €16 million has been allocated for that this year. There have also been improvements to the delivery of services and the assessment of need process is being reformed, which includes legislative reform.  The budget was impacted by the unit and the Cabinet subcommittee and there was a significant focus on disability, particularly the income disregards for carer's allowance, among other initiatives and payments. The budget also provided a record €3.8 billion allocation towards specialist disability services. This represents a 20% increase year on year. That is to provide permanent dedicated funding for essential disability services. The investment in children's disability services will provide therapy services and strengthen the children's disability network teams through the provision of additional staff and so forth. Some €20 million was targeted at the assessment of need waitlist initiative, providing up to 6,500 clinical assessments. We are developing our budget spotlight on disability. That will be published in due course. It relates to the last budget but will also provide further thinking with regard to future budgets. We are also looking at developments in the area of transport and mobility. We are awaiting proposals from the Departments of Transport and Finance in that regard. \n An Ceann Comhairle  I propose to take the first six Deputies and to allow the Taoiseach six minutes to respond. \n Deputy Pádraig O'Sullivan  This is a topic the Taoiseach is very familiar with. He has visited the Rainbow Club on dozens of occasions at this stage and knows the great work that Jon, Karen and the board do. When Senator Rabbitte was the Minister of State, she was the first to allocate funding to the Rainbow Club under a service level agreement to provide respite care for children. As the Taoiseach will know, every week, over 1,200 children avail of this service, which is provided on a shoestring budget. The Taoiseach will be very familiar with the difficulties the club had in acquiring a nearby site, the former HSE ambulance building. It now has that building and has been lucky enough to engage an architect who is a professional in this field pro bono to design a bespoke building that is fit for the club's purposes. We need to move this project on. We need the HSE and the Government to support it financially to deliver it. It is going to be a massive undertaking for the charity. What is the Taoiseach's office going to do to advance the project? \n Deputy Ruairí Ó Murchú  The National Human Rights Strategy for Disabled People 2025-2030 was launched with great fanfare but we await the action plan. There is much talk of accountability. Will the Taoiseach give me a timeline for the introduction of that action plan? Who will be taking the lead, particularly with regard to oversight and accountability? Will it be the unit, the Cabinet committee or the Department of Children, Disability and Equality? How exactly will it work? How will we see improvements, whether in relation to assessments and therapies or the low level of disabled people who are involved in employment and the need for schemes that actually work? A lot of work is needed to make schemes such as the wage subsidy scheme and the work and access programme fit for purpose. \n Deputy Cian O'Callaghan  The level of unemployment among disabled people in Ireland is among the worst in Europe. I recently met with a number of disabled people in my constituency who have excellent qualifications and skills and who are willing and eager to work but who are stuck in unemployment. There are a number of barriers to employment that need to be removed. We are far behind other European countries in this regard. In 2021, the OECD released a report that made a number of recommendations as to how to tackle this. Those recommendations have still not been implemented. When will they be implemented in full?  What is the Government doing to tackle the scandalously high unemployment levels for disabled people in Ireland? \n Deputy Barry Heneghan  Bhí mé ag caint faoi seo dhá sheachtain ó shin agus an tseachtain seo caite. An rud atá i gceist ná Stapolin Educate Together National School in Baldoyle, which has a petition. Children from the school were in the Dáil last week. It needs two autism classrooms to be sanctioned by the Minister. There are eight children in mainstream classes with eligibility letters and a further 30 in the catchment area who are on waiting lists. This is a huge priority for me and I would love it to be addressed. \n Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett  David and Nicole have a five-year-old son with autism, and an older son. They live in a maisonette, which is 29 sq. m. It is absolutely tiny and rank with damp. Because of his autism, their son has serious sensory processing issues. He is a flight risk. I know these flats well. They have very dangerous concrete steps, which are a serious risk to him. Occupational therapists, medical professionals and people in school have said that he has to be got out of there as he cannot develop or do his occupational therapy if he is living in these conditions. Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council says autism is too prevalent in the community to give it medical priority. That is outrageous. The prevalence of a condition is not a reason to say it is not a priority if the child is in danger. If a child is in danger, it is a priority to get the child out of danger. \n An Ceann Comhairle  I appreciate that. The Taoiseach has the message. \n Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett  I would like there to be an intervention on that. \n Deputy Paul Murphy  The budget was a savage attack on disabled people. It took over €1,000 out of the pockets of disabled people and betrayed the promise in the programme for Government to introduce a permanent annual cost-of-disability support payment. The last time I asked about this, the Taoiseach claimed the cost of disability would be looked at in the next budget. The cost-of-living crisis is now. The cost-of-disability crisis is now. Some 70,000 people who are disabled or have a long-term illness are living in poverty. That is one in three. I have been inundated with emails from disabled people asking for winter cost-of-living and cost-of-disability payment. Many will be forced to choose between heating and eating this Christmas. They also want a permanent cost-of-disability payment without further delay. The Taoiseach has billions of euro in surplus. Do not be a Scrooge this Christmas. Please act on it. \n Deputy Peadar Tóibín  The children's disability network team, CDNT, in Meath is not fully staffed. According to statistics I received today, there are 20 vacant posts across disability teams in Kells, Dunshaughlin, Navan, Slane and Trim. Separate data received by Aontú today show that the Government is actually reducing the number of college places for speech and language therapists, from 370 in the year before Covid to 355 last year. The Government is reducing the number of students filling the necessary college places on an annual basis. What is the Taoiseach saying to parents whose children have been waiting for 14 months to see the CDNT in County Meath and to the children who are being bounced around endlessly from CAMHS, the CDNTs and other services? \n An Ceann Comhairle  Before the Taoiseach replies, could he maybe answer the other Deputies in writing?  Sixteen Deputies did not get to ask questions. They might get some form of response from the Taoiseach. \n The Taoiseach  You can bring some more of them in if you want, a Cheann Comhairle. \n An Ceann Comhairle  Only if the Taoiseach needs less time. We cannot go over the 45 minutes provided. \n The Taoiseach  I am not going to write replies to oral questions. I have given an overall response to everybody. \n An Ceann Comhairle  I am bound by the timelines set down. \n The Taoiseach  Do I have six minutes remaining? \n An Ceann Comhairle  Yes. \n The Taoiseach  I will get around to everybody who has asked a question. \n An Ceann Comhairle  I am talking about the Deputies who have not have not got in. \n Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett  The Taoiseach cannot really answer questions that have not been asked. \n An Ceann Comhairle  I know, but that is it. \n The Taoiseach  It is a new departure if I am going to do a written reply to every oral question. That is not on either. \n An Ceann Comhairle  The Taoiseach should go ahead. I suppose it is just a casualty of how interruptions affect the course of questions. To be fair, the Taoiseach cannot answer a question that has not been asked. We are delaying the answering process. \n Deputy Jennifer Whitmore  Could we even have 30 seconds to ask a question and then maybe the Taoiseach could respond? \n An Ceann Comhairle  No. We cannot go over time. I do not set the time. I do not have that discretion. \n Deputy Jennifer Whitmore  No, but we could stay within the time. \n An Ceann Comhairle  There are 15 Deputies left. \n The Taoiseach  Deputy Pádraig O'Sullivan raised the Rainbow Club, which is doing exceptional work. Jon and Karen O'Mahony have been exceptional leaders in that regard. The former Minister of State, now Senator Rabbitte, did good work on a service level agreement. I was involved in advocating for that building, which was a HSE building, to be allocated to the Rainbow Club. I will certainly continue to work with them and to support them with capital. What is important is that we get a timeline and some idea of how we can progress that as quickly as we possibly can. It is a very good, practical example of how a parent-led, community-based approach can develop services for autism in a nimble and flexible way that has helped so many families.  Deputy Ó Murchú asked about the action plan. That will come.  I do not have an exact date but it is on target. It is fairly imminent. \n Deputy Ruairí Ó Murchú  Who will lead on it? \n An Ceann Comhairle  Please, Deputy Ó Murchú. \n The Taoiseach  The Minister, Deputy Foley, will lead, with the support of the unit in my office, but she will also report to the Cabinet subcommittee, which will then make recommendations to the Cabinet. That is how this will work. The Cabinet subcommittee is very important because all the key Ministers have to be there.  I agree with Deputy Cian O'Callaghan that the unemployment levels among the disability community is too high, and the barriers are too much. Part of the strategy in terms of what I am trying to do with the Minister, Deputy Calleary, is to remove some of those barriers and to create additional supports to make sure that employers are even more incentivised to recruit people. The intention is also to give supports to those who employ people with disabilities on a more sustainable basis. I do not disagree with the Deputy. The historic underemployment of people with disabilities in society is something that is exercising me.  I will pursue the issue raised by Deputy Heneghan about the two autism classes in the Educate Together school in Baldoyle.  I agree with Deputy Boyd Barrett. That is a very strange response from the council referring to the prevalence of autism. Autism is a spectrum, a continuum. There is high-functioning autism, people in the middle and those with autism which is very severe and profound. The council should be able to use the general guidelines in respect of health needs more generally. I am at a loss as to why the council cannot say in this case that the child needs prioritisation and a proper house to facilitate the treatment and life of the child. That is something on which I will go back to the Minister for housing in respect of guidelines to be sent to councils in that respect. I would not have thought it necessary. I thought councils would have enough flexibility to do this.  I disagree with Deputy Paul Murphy's description of the budget as a savage attack, but €3 billion has been invested in special education as an outcome of the budget, as well as €130 million for grants to adapt the houses of older people and disabled people. There was a €10 increase per week in the disability allowance, an expansion of the wage subsidy scheme, an increase of €375 in the income limit for carer's benefit, and a €20 increase in the monthly domiciliary care allowance. That is not a savage attack on disability. We have to pursue the cost of disability and the Minister will bring plans in the next budget in respect of that.  In response to Deputy Tóibín, the vacancy rate nationally has come down for CDNTs. We have increased the allocation of therapy places in third level colleges. \n An Ceann Comhairle  I thank the Taoiseach. Even though there is time left, the point is that this format is not working. The place to discuss that is at the Business Committee on Thursday. I ask Members to bring it up and we can sort out something else. Certainly, where there is a grouping of 19 Members, it is not possible to give the Taoiseach time to answer in the remaining time. I am sorry for those who did not get in but there is just nothing we can do, other than discuss it at the Business Committee and change the format. ",

This followed many years of work by my Department, with the Department of Education and Youth, the Department of Public Expenditure, Education and Training Boards Ireland (ETBI), and the relevant trade unions, SIPTU and TUI.  This grade was established in response to a claim by tutors and the subsequent Labour Court recommendation. The recommendation specified that any new grade could not align with teachers due to differences in the roles, qualifications and regulatory frameworks for tutors and teachers.  Depending on the duration of a contract and whether the adult educator opted for salary spread (those who work 37 weeks or more can opt for salary spread over 52 weeks), there will be instances where annual leave does not cover non-delivery periods/centre closures and there will be temporary lay offs. This is the case for many categories of workers in education. Annual leave for adult educators is 35 days (pro-rated). Leave is used to reduce periods of layoff at traditional closure periods. It cannot be used during delivery periods.  Educational Support Workers, including adult educators, who wish to avail of income support while temporarily being laid-off can apply for jobseekers’ payments. Applicants must satisfy the qualifying conditions. Those who have previously been in contact with the Department of Social Protection (DSP) are issued with repeat jobseekers’ application and holiday entitlement forms in advance of college/school closures. This advance process expediates such workers’ claims. In recent years, DSP has resourced dedicated teams to work on Educational Support Workers’ claims to minimise delays. If any DSP customer is in urgent financial need, DSP’s Community Welfare Service can provide assistance while they wait for their claim to be processed.  Individual ETBs are the employers and, as such, are responsible for staffing matters with Ministerial consents and approvals as may be determined from time to time. ",

        "answerText": " The Taoiseach  I propose to take Questions Nos. 1 to 16, inclusive, together.  The Cabinet Committee on water quality oversees implementation of the programme for Government commitments in relation to the range of issues affecting Ireland’s water system. The committee last met on 30 October and the date of its next meeting has not yet been scheduled. The committee is informed by the work of the Environmental Protection Agency, EPA, which monitors and reports on water quality in Ireland. The EPA recently published its report Water Quality in Ireland 2019-2024, which shows water quality improvements in some areas but also an overall decline in waterbodies in a satisfactory ecological condition. While the overall ecological status of Ireland’s waters is significantly better than the European Union average, the downward trend is a matter of concern. The report shows that targeted actions in the agricultural sector and improvements in wastewater treatment appear to be paying dividends, with lower reported levels of nutrients in water bodies where targeted actions have been taken.  The Cabinet committee has also examined the investment programme of Uisce Éireann to improve wastewater treatment capacity and meet best practice in managing its existing infrastructure. Last week, the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage published a sectoral plan for water services and water quality. This includes record investment of €12.2 billion, largely allocated to Uisce Éireann to support the delivery of the additional water services capacity required to deliver the Government's housing plan and to improve water quality. This investment will help to deliver the Government water action plan, Ireland's roadmap to protect and restore our rivers, lakes, estuaries, coastal waters and ground waters.  Last year, the Government also published Water and Agriculture: A Collaborative Approach, and this report sets out measures to address the twin objectives of improving water quality and demonstrating that a robust case exists for the maintenance of a derogation for Ireland from certain aspects of the EU nitrates directive. In October, the Minister, Deputy Browne, published a draft nitrates action programme, which will form the basis of Ireland’s ongoing discussions with the European Commission on a new derogation. The Minister has invited submissions from the public on its contents. A public consultation process on the strategic environmental assessment and appropriate assessment of the plan is also live, with submissions invited by 1 December.  European Union environmental Commissioner Roswall visited Ireland last week and met with the Minister, Deputy Heydon, as well as farmers and other stakeholders to discuss Ireland's application for a derogation and the importance of its continuation to Ireland's outdoor, grass-based livestock systems. The visit provided an opportunity for the Commissioner to visit a farm in County Kildare to see at first hand the efforts towards improving water quality and to engage with public representatives and stakeholders. Discussions with the Commission are ongoing to find an approach that facilitates the continuation of high-quality dairy and beef production by derogation farmers while ensuring sufficient protection for the quality and ecological status of our rivers, lakes and estuaries. \n An Ceann Comhairle  We have 16 speakers. They have a minute each and I ask them to be as concise as possible. I call on Deputy Cleere. \n Deputy Peter 'Chap' Cleere  Last week, we saw serious disruption for towns and villages like Thomastown, Graiguenamanagh, Inistioge and Freshford, which are currently faced with significant backlogs for the implementation of effective flood relief schemes. I acknowledge there has been extensive consultations with local communities to achieve a solution that satisfies those communities and the needs of the local environment. However, the delivery has been delayed far too long. The conversation needs to move to action. It is all about implementation and delivering effective solutions for these communities at risk.  Let me give the Taoiseach a brief example. In Graiguenamanagh, my own town, there was a major flood issue in 2016. In 2018, funding was announced. In 2020, a design team was assigned. We are now in November 2025, and we have not even gone for planning permission yet. It is anticipated that the planning process will take two years. Construction will then start at the end of 2028, with a two-year timeframe for completion. That just gives an example of the length of time these projects are taking. \n An Ceann Comhairle  The Deputy has five seconds. \n Deputy Peter 'Chap' Cleere  I understand that fish life is important, but what about the lives of Johnny and Mary, living in a house that has been flooded? The people in Freshford, Graiguenamanagh, Thomastown and Inistioge are going to bed at night from November to March wondering if their houses will be flooded come the morning. \n An Ceann Comhairle  I thank the Deputy. \n Deputy Peter 'Chap' Cleere  The injustice to these communities has gone on far too long. \n Deputy Aindrias Moynihan  Farmers are very keen to improve water quality. The recent oversubscription of environmental schemes reflects that appetite. Our grass-based system differs very much from what would be found across Europe. Family farms right across Ireland need to be able to plan for the year ahead and the nitrates derogation is very much part of the planning for the day-to-day operation of the farms. Farmers are really keen to know where they stand and they are going to need to know that for the start of the year. Retaining this derogation is vital. I very much impressed this on Commissioner Roswall during her recent visit to Ireland. She did acknowledge that progress had been made but she was also keen to see that there would be ongoing progress and improvements. Will the Minister and the Government be able to win support across EU colleagues to ensure the derogation will be retained? Additionally, farmers are also being told they are not alone in respect of improving water quality. They are keen to pull their weight and they will, but they also need to know that municipal waste inputs and Irish Water will also pull their weight. \n Deputy Paul Murphy  Two years ago, I raised with the Taoiseach a repeated problem of sewage overflowing in Dodder Valley Park beside Balrothery weir. When there is heavy rainfall, the sewage shoots out beside a residential area in a beautiful park. It is still happening. It happened again last weekend with the heavy rainfall. In March 2024, I got a reply from Uisce Éireann accepting that it was impacting the environment and posing a risk to public health through flooding. At that time, it said it was at stage 3 of a four-stage process and it would have options and costings in quarter 4 of 2024. In August 2024, I followed up on this matter. I got a response in February of this year, over six months after the promised commencement of stage 4. The company apologised for the delay and said it was concluding stage 3 and moving into stage 4. I have followed up again with the company. It is simply unacceptable that the health of residents and park users is put at risk and that the deadlines for action keep getting delayed. Does the Taoiseach agree that Irish Water, Uisce Éireann, must act? \n Deputy Ruairí Ó Murchú  I would like to use this time to remember Chloe McGee, Chloe Hipson, Dylan Commins, Shay Duffy and Alan McCluskey. Ar dheis Dé go raibh a n-anamacha dílse. We think of their families and friends. It is going to be a very difficult time over the next couple of days for communities right across counties Louth, Monaghan and Meath. I have been in O'Fiaich College and DkIT and seen huge supports for students and staff. It was the same in the Sean McDermotts club last night also. This is the level of resilience we will see. My thoughts go out to those affected by what has been an absolutely desperate tragedy. I also think of those injured. We hope for a speedy recovery. Beyond that, we think of the emergency services, whose members saw things nobody should have to see. \n An Ceann Comhairle  Go raibh maith agat. I appreciate that yesterday's proceedings overtook us and we did not get to pay our due respects. What the Deputy said goes for us all. I thank him. I call on Deputy Conor D. McGuinness. \n Deputy Conor D. McGuinness  Go raibh maith agat. I want to raise with the Taoiseach the situation of two households living in Lyre, Mahon Bridge, County Waterford. They live in two adjoining council-built cottages constructed in 1949. At the time, the local authority installed a water supply from an open stream flowing off the Comeragh Mountains, and that is still their only source of water 75 years later. It is untreated and coming from a roadside stream. The water runs black and is full of silt, filth and worse. Each of the men has pulled dead rats and badgers from it on occasion. The supply is so unsafe that the health authorities have warned them not to even wash their hands with it.  I have raised this directly with the Minister for housing and with Uisce Éireann. A brand new public mains runs just 500 m from the townland of Fews across from these men's homes. Connecting these homes would require just a short bore under a regional road but Uisce Éireann has refused to fund it and instead told residents to apply for a private well grant. Unfortunately, the land in the area they live in is not suitable for a private well and they have that on good authority from several professional well drillers. Will the Taoiseach please act in the interests of these two households and instruct Uisce Éireann? I will show the Taoiseach, very briefly, a bottle with a sample of water they provided me with recently. It illustrates the depth of what their public water supply is. \n An Ceann Comhairle  Deputy, we do not allow displays of such nature but I understand it is your first time. I call Deputy Barry Heneghan. \n Deputy Barry Heneghan  I have raised the issue of water quality in Dublin Bay time and time again. I am not going to just single out the north side. This is a north and south Dublin problem. We saw the rain that fell at the weekend. We have all seen the drone footage of the bay being polluted. I have swimmers whose only way of socialising is getting into that water and having the chats but the E. coli levels are not acceptable at the moment. In Dublin Bay and with the way the plumes work with the tides, the north side is affected worse when there is a high level. Some of these constituents are here today with the visual artists from Palestine who raised money for Artists Without Borders in Clontarf Castle. They are going to be swimming in that water. These are the people who need this water protected. We see in Dún Laoghaire that oysters are being brought in to treat the water. Can we get that on the north side as well? I have a mandate for that. It was on my four-pager. Oysters are great natural filters of E. coli and other contaminants. \n Deputy Rose Conway-Walsh  The EU drinking water regulations came into effect in Irish law in March 2023. \n The Taoiseach  Sorry, the which? \n Deputy Rose Conway-Walsh  The EU drinking water regulations. I raise it in the context of the ongoing intolerable situation where 500 households in Ballycroy and Inishbiggle, in County Mayo are left without water for days on end. The way to solve this is to allow some flexibility in the multi-annual water programme to enable moneys that have been returned to the Department, or are to be returned to the Department, from one scheme can be reallocated to another scheme that desperately needs it. There is a gravity-fed group scheme in Ballycroy and it is run by volunteers. What has happened is some of the volunteers have passed away so they are trying to reconfigure the volunteers in the parish to be able to apply for the necessary funding. There is a way to solve this. Mayo County Council applied for emergency funding earlier this year but was unsuccessful so we need emergency funding and some flexibility around the framework. \n Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett  I also wish to raise the issue of water quality in Dublin Bay, for the umpteenth time. Every time there is a massive downpour like the ones we had very recently, rainfall water or stormwater mixes with sewage and pours into Dublin Bay. The pumping station at the west pier in Dún Laoghaire pumps stuff out to Ringsend but Ringsend does not have the capacity. It overflows, goes into Dublin Bay and then water quality is very seriously undermined.  I was looking at a question I asked back in 2019, and it was not the first time. Even then, the Government was promising it was going to upgrade Ringsend. That was 2019 and it still has not been done. It still happens every time it rains. It is unbelievable. When is the Government finally going to make sure that the upgrade at Ringsend and the rehabilitation of our decrepit water infrastructure, which is jeopardising water quality, swimmers and health and causing all sorts of bad, adverse problems, is going to be finally addressed by this Government? \n Deputy Liam Quaide  I know the Taoiseach will reject the claim that rural Ireland is being left behind by his Government but many residents of the village of Ballyhooly in my constituency beg to differ. They have good reason to. The very basic need for a consistent supply of water to drink, bathe in or use in appliances such as dishwashers and showers has been denied to them for many years. Residents in Ballyhooly have to deal with extremely low water pressure alternating with a non-existent supply of water for prolonged periods. This has hit people with chronic illness, disability and age-related care needs the hardest. It has also severely impacted the local school and farming community. In recent months, there has been a reprieve from a full-scale outage but water pressure remains very low and there is no clear timeframe on the extent of works required to resolve the issue. Short-term fixes will no longer cut it for Ballyhooly. When are we going to see movement on this essential project that will allow the village to thrive? \n Deputy Erin McGreehan  Along with my constituency colleague, I want to pay respects to those poor five souls, the young people who lost their lives in the car accident at the weekend: Chloe McGee, Shay Duffy, Alan McCluskey, Dylan Commins and Chloe Hipson. It is a desperate loss for their families, friends, work colleagues and everybody. I only hope their families can find the strength to walk along the pain and agony that comes upon a family when they lose someone so tragically. It seems almost futile and frivolous to mention it during a discussion on water quality.  I have raised on several occasions the state of the water and rivers around Dundalk Bay. Research was published recently in a local newsletter spelling out clearly issues around repeated sewage discharge and wastewater plants operating beyond capacity, with visible waste near Blackrock and protected habitats being steadily damaged. People are seeing it, smelling it and living beside it. As the Taoiseach knows, I raise these concerns regularly and I get very dismissive responses from Irish Water. I often feel almost gaslit by them. I hope that when the Cabinet committee is working on water quality with the infrastructure Department that it will consider fast-tracking projects to make sure our water quality is up to standard. \n Deputy Peadar Tóibín  Keeping the lights and on and water in the taps is surely one of the basic responsibilities of any administration but we live in a country where that is simply not happening. For a country where it seldom stops raining, it hardly goes a week before there is a water or hosepipe ban in this country. In my county of Meath, things are out of control currently. As we speak, a burst mains causing major disruption in Navan. There are multiple outages every week in the system in Enfield. People in Trim can hardly turn the water taps on because of discoloured water or bans on water being used at certain times of the day, etc. Councillor Dave Boyne and I have had to campaign to get water trucks to bring water to other towns in the county. The Taoiseach talks about massive investment, which is welcome, but it is not making a difference on the ground because there are major problems for Irish Water to deliver on infrastructure in terms of planning, permits and tendering etc. When will those be fixed so we can get the system fixed? \n Deputy Paul Lawless  I have raised this many times previously but the water quality in Clew Bay, County Mayo is being massively damaged at the moment. Raw sewage from Newport town is collected and stored in containers. When the high tide comes in to Clew Bay, it washes raw sewage on to the shoreline. Everyone is in agreement that a water treatment plant is needed for the town and it has been in the planning process for decades. There are significant issues in relation to the Maritime Area Regulatory Authority, MARA, which is not meeting its statutory timelines, and indeed Uisce Éireann. It appears that what is happening is a letter-writing club between the two organisations, with no progress being made. I have raised this previously and I ask the Taoiseach to intervene. We cannot have critical infrastructure delayed for decades as a result. I have raised this with Uisce Éireann and MARA but it is time the Government intervened and injected some urgency into this. \n The Taoiseach  I thank all of the Deputies. A comprehensive number spoke in respect of the responsibilities of Irish Water, particularly in terms of wastewater treatment plants and flood relief schemes.  Deputy 'Chap' Cleere raised the issue of a series of flood relief schemes in his constituency. I do not know why the planning process should take two years and that is something we need to analyse further but measures will come to Government in respect of critical infrastructure in the next number of weeks. Flood relief schemes are taking too long because the urgency is very real.  Given the worsening climate, we have more frequent storms and rainfall that is heavier and comes in short bursts and that is creating huge pressure on our systems. I have been to many flooding scenes where the devastation is appalling and negatively impacts on households and businesses. We then have consequential compensation schemes and everything we try to do to alleviate the pressure but there is nothing worse than being the victim of a flooding incident. I will take a look at those schemes and talk to the Minister of State with responsibility for the OPW, Deputy Moran, to see how we can accelerate this. We are also looking at a critical infrastructure Bill and will see whether we can include wastewater and flood relief schemes.  Deputy Aindrias Moynihan raised the derogation and I fully agree with him that retaining the derogation is vital for farm families and for the food production system and the dairy industry. We need a sustainable farming industry but farmers are working with us on various water improvement schemes under the European Union framework and have being doing a lot to measure and assess this work. I have had discussions with the President of the European Commission explaining the unique position in Ireland because we have a pasture-based system that is outdoors more than indoors. Most other European systems are indoors. The Minister for agriculture, Deputy Heydon, has been working with Commissioner Roswall, who came to Ireland last week. She met farmers in Kildare and saw first-hand the measures we are taking to make farming and agriculture more sustainable. We know farmers do need to know. I take the Deputy's point in respect of other contributors to waste and I met representatives of Irish Water recently in the context of the Cabinet subcommittee meeting. Representatives from the Environmental Protection Agency were there as well. In my view, Irish Water has to get it right in respect of its own actions. It cannot contribute negatively to water quality, being a water body itself, nor can local authorities. They also certainly need to step up to the plate in protecting our waterways.  Deputy Murphy raised the issue of Balrothery estate in terms of sewerage overflow. Again, I will talk to Irish Water in respect of where that is at. We have allocated unprecedented resources to Irish Water as a result of the national development plan and we have given it multi-annual funding. Irish Water knows what its funding will be for the next five years, which should enable staff to get on, to plan and do things. There is a lot of work to be done. Our population is growing exponentially, and has grown during the past two decades. That is creating pressure on water services. What will be important as well, for those who correctly referenced wastewater treatment plants, is that we have to try to create a narrative and a consensus in society not to object to wastewater treatment plants, to their upgrade or to supply projects. An awful lot of these projects are getting snarled up in planning and being delayed for far too long. What is happening in the preparation of the schemes, stage III to stage IV, is that everybody is dotting the i's and crossing the t's because they are anticipating an objection or a judicial review so they want to make sure they can be resilient in the face of a court case being heard or a judicial review of a decision taken during the planning process. What we are getting is a very slow process in getting projects through. We will have to deal with that and the Government is determined to deal with that because we have to push ahead. Even on a small issue like apartment guidelines, and we had it earlier this afternoon during Leaders' Questions, we get public representatives judicially reviewing regulation. Then people complain about things not moving. We cannot have it our own way, every way, but that is a general comment on where we are and it is important.  Deputies Ó Murchú and McGreehan correctly articulated all of our shock and horror at the devastating accident in Louth. Five young lives were lost. They were going out for a nice evening. We are all parents and we are all afraid of something like that happening when our young people go out and so on and we all want them to come home. On this occasion, they did not come home and the impacts on the parents are beyond comprehension. It is very difficult for them. We hope the beautiful memories they had with their young children will sustain them in the time ahead. I thank the Deputies for raising this in the House.  In regard to Deputy McGuinness's contribution, I will talk to Irish Water. I cannot get involved in every single case. This relates to two houses. Surely the county council and Irish Water should knock heads together and get that issue sorted if the water mains are 500 m away.  Deputy Heneghan has left the Chamber. He has gone with the swimmers; I would say they are gone too. Deputy Boyd Barrett raised the issue of Dublin Bay as well. It is a very serious issue. E.coli levels are too high and when there is heavy rain. people cannot swim. That is not satisfactory. I am back to the issue that we need wastewater treatment plants. The whole Dublin water project is being judicially reviewed. The Arklow wastewater treatment plant was conceived at the same time as the Dublin scheme. It has opened - I opened it - and the Dublin scheme has not even gotten off the ground. There are other projects of that kind we need to get off the ground and to get going. The points were well made by Deputies Boyd Barrett and Heneghan in that regard.  In terms of the drinking water regulation and the 500 households, again it is a specific issue and I will talk to Irish Water in respect of that. \n Deputy Rose Conway-Walsh  That is not Irish Water \n The Taoiseach  Is it a group scheme? \n Deputy Rose Conway-Walsh  It is a group scheme. \n The Taoiseach  The Deputy wants flexibility in the multi-annual funding. I will talk to the Minister to see whether there is anything that can be done there or not. \n Deputy Rose Conway-Walsh  Thank you. \n The Taoiseach  There is a combination of issues in terms of the reconstitution of the group of volunteers. Deputy Boyd Barrett raised the issue that Ringsend does not have capacity. We have been engaging and have appointed----- \n Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett  It has been going on for years. \n The Taoiseach  I know and we have allocated billions of euro now so hopefully we can get it done.  Deputy Quaide raised the issue of Balyhooly and the basic quality of water. I have spoken to Irish Water representatives about the Cork situation more generally in terms of water quality issues and they are working on that.  Deputy McGreehan again raised the issue of habitats and Dundalk Bay. Again, I asked Irish Water to engage with public representatives. All State agencies should engage with public representatives in a respectful and engaging way and should give proper responses. The State funds these agencies. In many ways they are created as agencies to get things done but that should not absolve the agencies then of their responsibilities to communicate to democratically elected Deputies and Senators or indeed councillors on the local authorities as well. I will have a look at what the story is in Dundalk Bay.  Deputy Tóibín raised the issue of Trim again in terms of keeping the taps on and water quality. Again, it relates to wider issues. They had the plan, we have now funded the plan, and the issue now is getting things done as quickly as we can.  Deputy Lawless raised Clew Bay and Newport. Again, it is about getting the infrastructure in place as quickly as we can. I will relay all of those to Irish Water for a response. \n An Ceann Comhairle  I thank the Taoiseach. We will move to the next questions, which is the grouping of Question Nos. 17 to 31, inclusive, to ask the Taoiseach for a report on the work of the shared island unit. We have 17 minutes and 14 seconds left. ",

        "answerText": " The Taoiseach  I propose to take Questions Nos. 17 to 31, inclusive, together.  Our programme for Government sets out an ambitious agenda for building our shared island. Yesterday, the Government made a major funding commitment of over €50 million through our shared island fund to ten new programmes.  We are investing for the future to improve people’s lives and strengthen connections across the island of Ireland . We are moving forward with €14 million for a major new shared island media initiative by Coimisiún na Meán, delivering on our programme for Government commitment to resource schemes to encourage cross-Border journalism on an ongoing basis;  A sum of €5.9 million is being allocated to the fire and emergency services from North and South to deepen their co-operation to enhance capacity and training on management of flooding events  and on search and rescue operations. There will be €6 million for the new shared home place programme, which will foster a sustained, broad engagement with all communities on this island and with our diaspora on the island of Ireland’s diverse heritage, and how this can shape our shared future. Funding of €14.5 million is being allocated for an expanded creative lreland shared island programme and arts projects. There will be a €1.8 million contribution to the next phase of the all-Ireland pollinator plan to protect the island’s unique biodiversity.  Ministers are also working with confirmed shared island fund resourcing to establish a new air link between Derry and Dublin next year; support development of new cross-Border and Border region greenway routes; deepen our co-operation with Northern Ireland Executive counterparts on tackling bovine TB, the information service for cross-Border workers and commercialising research. The Government also yesterday, as part of the national development plan review, published our shared island investment priorities across virtually all sectors out to 2035, backed by our shared island fund and other resourcing.  The iconic Narrow Water Bridge and Ulster Canal restoration projects are forging ahead. Next year, Government resourcing will enable commencement of construction of a new teaching building at Ulster University in Derry and continue the transformative hourly frequency Dublin to Belfast rail service. In April, I launched a new phase of my Department’s joint research programme with the Economic and Social Research Institute, ESRI, with a focus on strategic policy and co-operation considerations for the island, and research projects for 2025-26 are under way. This includes a new annual report series by the ESRI assessing economic trends across the island of Ireland, which will be published next month.  Through our shared island Initiative, the Government will continue to invest in strategic all-island co-operation and deepen our partnership with the Executive and UK Government as we work every day to build reconciliation between the different traditions of this island. \n Deputy Erin McGreehan  The shared island unit has real potential and has had real results and benefits for County Louth and the country, as the Taoiseach said, in terms of the arts, emergency services and biodiversity. Yesterday's announcement that Dundalk Institute of Technology, DKIT, will gain university status alongside Queen's University Belfast is incredibly exciting news. It will be transformative for the north east, and will be a really complementary match-up with Queen's University as well. This is a huge opportunity for the shared island unit to invest in the future, to invest in our young people and to invest in our economy and our industry.  I wish to ask the Taoiseach about the investment in people and about deeper health care co-operation with our neighbours in the North. There have to be synergies and opportunities there that we can look at with Daisy Hill Hospital in Newry and even further afield in Dundalk. We can start looking at how we can look after the communities in the Cooley Peninsula, Carlingford and Omeath, and how we can reflect this in our usual daily life and health care. They do not match up at the minute and we can do more. \n Deputy Cormac Devlin  I thank the Taoiseach for the reply and in particular the announcement of €50 million for the new projects, which is very welcome. We need to see more of the practical people-focused projects like those. The Taoiseach mentioned the Dublin-Derry link among other initiatives. The Enterprise rail link between Dublin and Belfast has proven very popular. I ask that it be considered to extend that further to support the night-time economy of both cities. That would be a very important move.  In the same spirit, the announcement by Minister for higher education, Deputy Lawless, of a major new partnership between Dundalk IT and Queen's University, establishing DKIT as a University College of Queen's University is a landmark development for higher education and for the Dublin-Belfast corridor. Will the Taoiseach set out how these shared island allocations and DKIT-Queen's partnership will be aligned as part of a cohort plan for the Dublin-Belfast corridor? Will the Taoiseach confirm that the necessary policy and legislative frameworks will be brought to Government early in 2026 so that students, staff and local communities can see these benefits on the ground as quickly as possible? \n Deputy Paul Murphy  I will quote the Taoiseach who told an international audience at COP30:  The science is undeniable. Temperatures are rising, and the clock is ticking. If we are not prepared to tell our citizens the truth about this, we are failing them, and this planet, in the most profound way.  Has the Taoiseach tried telling the truth to the big dairy farmers and the big dairy processors who are driving up carbon emissions and are polluting our waterways, North and South? I have raised the issue previously in terms of Lough Neagh. Lough Derg is the latest of our lakes to turn neon green, a 41st shade of green that the Taoiseach will not be plámásing world leaders about. The main cause is nutrient pollution from agriculture, accelerated by the nitrates derogation. When will the Taoiseach tell the truth that environmental protection and intensive for-profit animal agriculture are incompatible, that we need to reduce the number of dairy cattle, that we need to compensate farmers with a herd reduction scheme and that the nitrates derogation must go? \n An Ceann Comhairle  I will just pause the clock for a minute. We have only eight minutes left in this session and we cannot go over time, I am afraid. I do not have that discretion for Taoiseach's Questions. I will have to limit each Member's contribution to 30 seconds give the Taoiseach an opportunity to respond. \n Deputy Ruairí Ó Murchú  I would like to bring up the fabulous news about the partnership between DKIT and Queen's University. We are talking about a greater level of provision of undergraduate and postgraduate programmes and an innovation and research hub to be based in Dundalk. We know that this can definitely develop the Dublin-Belfast corridor. There is a necessity to follow through with legislative support. Beyond that, this could be part of a vital shared island project. I would like to know what will happen in that regard. \n Deputy Michael Murphy  The question of greater North-South integration and any future constitutional change carries profound economic implications. It is really important that we approach this debate with honesty and clarity. Further integration will require significant investment, aligning public services, connecting infrastructure, integrating health and education and ensuring social welfare compatibility. If we are to maintain public confidence, we need transparent, independent economic analysis. We need to be honest about the challenges and the opportunities. \n Deputy Liam Quaide  In recent times we have seen an alarming escalation in racist violence against immigrants and minority communities both North and South of this island. According to An Garda Síochána statistics, race crimes and related incidents rose by 24% between 2021 and 2024. There were similar increases in such crimes in the North between July 2024 and June of this year. Amnesty International has described this period in the North as \"a year of hate and fear\". There is a striking similarity of experiences of minorities both North and South in respect of these increased threats. There is also clear potential to collaborate on an all-island basis. What initiatives are under way or planned to help support integration through communities North and South to help them learn from each other in terms of best practice? \n Deputy Shane Moynihan  Yesterday's announcement is very welcome in terms of the infrastructure foundations put in place to harness the economic potential of the shared island. Part of that, which we have discussed in this House, is the role of the all-island labour market and the need for focus and skills. I would love to hear from the Taoiseach about what engagement is happening with the Northern Ireland Executive with regard to building up the SME sector across both sides of the island. They will be the fabric that knit the economic fabric of this island together in creating the shared island and creating a shared and united future for all. What schemes are being put in place to incentivise and promote that? \n Deputy Rose Conway-Walsh  I commend the work of Dublin City University, Aberdeen University and University College Dublin on the constitutional deliberations from grassroots that is being done by Dr. Shelley Deane, Professor Joanne McEvoy and Professor Jennifer Todd. I raise this because this work has been done with focus groups in Mayo, Bellaghy, Longford, Cookstown and Monaghan. The shared island unit, which is very much welcome, is doing work on women and the Constitution. I ask that the unit uses this academic work to underpin what the unit is going to do. The credibility of the work the academics are doing would really carry this forward. Why has it not got academic underpinning? \n Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett  Across Britain and the North of Ireland people are being arrested, prosecuted and, in some cases, imprisoned because they support Palestine Action, on the basis that the British Government has designated Palestine Action, a group campaigning against British complicity with the genocide that Israel is committing, as a terrorist organisation. It is absolutely outrageous. There will be a protest this Saturday in Belfast as people stand in solidarity with it. Sally Rooney has written an article in The Guardian this week about prisoners being close enough to being tortured in British prisons who are in prison awaiting trial on this. Will the Taoiseach speak out against the British Government's outrageous decision to designate protesting against genocide as somehow terrorism? \n Deputy Peadar Tóibín  BBC Northern Ireland runs a podcast called \"Borderline\". The podcast is part of the significant debate on Irish unity that is happening across the country. One of the themes of that podcast is the fact that the Irish Government is not participating in that discussion.  Many voices have stated there is a serious reluctance from the Government to even discuss the issue of Irish unity. The debate has moved on. People North and South are now talking about what planning and preparation is necessary for the referendum to be held. Brexit shows the danger of holding a referendum without doing the planning and preparation in the first place. \n An Ceann Comhairle  Thank you, Deputy. I call Deputy Lawless. \n Deputy Peadar Tóibín  This morning the BBC mentioned that the Irish Government is the only place where this planning and preparation could happen. \n An Ceann Comhairle  Deputy Lawless. \n Deputy Peadar Tóibín  When will the Taoiseach step up to the plate? \n Deputy Paul Lawless  I want to raise concerns about the Supreme Court ruling in Britain on religious education and collective worship in the North of Ireland. Aontú is a pluralist republican party. I believe it is really important that all parents can choose the ethos of the school they wish to send their children to. Catholic schools played a significant role in the lives of nationalist families. They were a safe place for Catholics in the North and promoted the Irish language and games. \n An Ceann Comhairle  Thank you, Deputy. \n Deputy Paul Lawless  Will the Taoiseach engage with his counterpart----- \n An Ceann Comhairle  Thank you. \n Deputy Paul Lawless  -----in Britain to ensure we can retain our Catholic schools in the North? Schools can be an inclusive----- \n An Ceann Comhairle  Thank you, Deputy. Your time is up. If you want a response----- \n Deputy Paul Lawless  -----place and a religious place. \n An Ceann Comhairle  I call the Taoiseach, who has limited time I am afraid. \n The Taoiseach  I thank all of the Deputies for raising important issues. Deputy McGreehan in the first instance correctly identified that we are delivering results in respect of the shared island unit. It is practical and impactful. It is not about rhetoric. We have had rhetoric for 60 or 70 years and longer. It is about getting things done and delivering, and that is what we are doing. I take the point the Deputy made in respect of Dundalk IT and Queen's University. That is a very exciting development. It is a huge opportunity. Both institutions have to work now, as Deputy Ó Murchú said, to get the heads of agreement worked out and proper understanding for the benefit of students and staff. Deputy McGreehan has been a strong advocate of this. Deputy Ó Murchú has raised it as well. I have made it clear to the Minister, Deputy James Lawless, that I am supportive. I have no doubt that if the shared island unit gets a concrete proposal, it can respond positively. Obviously there is a lot more detailed work to be done. We need to do this properly, which is why the fund goes out to 2035. We do not need to rush things. We need to get them done properly and effectively so it is informed.  Deputy Devlin used the phrase \"practical people-focused projects\". This sums it up. No other Government since the foundation of the State has invested in Northern Ireland like this Government has. The shared island unit is a unique departure. It speaks far more than a lot of the rhetoric. I have been reading a lot about the 1940s, the 1950s and the 1960s. Some pretty good histories have been published recently on partition. Some good work has been done on all of this. Throughout the decades people spoke about four green fields, unity and all the rest of it but very little happened. We have come through 30 years of horrific violence, which was unnecessary in my view. We have an opportunity now. People are entitled to their constitutional positions. There is no issue there. There is nothing stopping any political party, by the way, from advancing a detailed blueprint. I have yet to see one. There is nothing stopping any political party doing this but we can come back to it on another day. \n Deputy Peadar Tóibín  The Government is the best place to do it. \n The Taoiseach  These questions are on the shared island unit so I will keep it there.  Deputy Devlin raised Dundalk IT and Queen's University and I have explained this. With regard to Dublin and Belfast and the night-time economies, we are very anxious to really develop the Dublin-Belfast economic corridor. The councils are good. I get the point on the night-time economies. I will look at it in terms of what we can do.  To respond to Deputy Paul Murphy, COP is a bit outside the shared island unit but he got it in. When he speaks about \"the big dairy farmers\" - he is classic at this - he is pretending that medium-sized and small dairy farmers would be okay under him. What he is saying would wipe out dairy farming entirely. This is what he is saying and he should be honest about it. The Government has made its position clear on this.  I agree 100% with Deputy Michael Murphy that we need evidence-based, informed and objective research and data. The shared island unit has a separate strand for big funding where we commission the ESRI to do major research. It did one on school completion North and South. The North was higher. We now have an initiative under the shared island unit on healthcare. \n An Ceann Comhairle  Thank you, Taoiseach. \n The Taoiseach  It has done economic studies as well as studies on primary care and health. Very good studies are being done by the ESRI and there will be more. More data will be coming next month. Research is also being done by the National Economic and Social Council.  To respond to Deputy Quaide, we are doing work in the area he mentioned but there is potential for more work if we can get a viable project. He is correct that attacks have increased. People are living in fear and this is a big concern.  To respond to Deputy Shane Moynihan, work has been done under the shared island unit in terms of enterprise centres and on SMEs. Deputy Moynihan can look at InterTradeIreland's project under the shared island unit, which I launched recently. Tremendous work has been done joining companies North and South together using shared island unit funding.  To respond to Deputy Conway-Walsh, there is commissioned research from the ESRI on economics. The shared island unit is outside of the constitutional issue and will remain so to try to get buy-in from all communities without prejudice. This is one of the reasons it has buy-in across the board from all communities and traditions. \n Deputy Rose Conway-Walsh  I am trying to avoid reinventing the wheel. \n The Taoiseach  Yes, but we do not want to undermine and kill what is a good initiative. \n Deputy Rose Conway-Walsh  It is not----- \n An Ceann Comhairle  We are out of time. \n The Taoiseach  Deputy Boyd Barrett raised what is a separate issue really. I would disagree with Deputy----- \n Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett  It is not a separate issue. People in the North are being arrested. \n The Taoiseach  I cannot account for the British----- \n An Ceann Comhairle  Thank you, Taoiseach, we are out of time. That concludes Questions to the Taoiseach. \n The Taoiseach  I will come back to Deputy Boyd Barrett another day on that. ",

        "answerText": " Minister for Justice, Home Affairs and Migration  Ireland is currently accommodating nearly 33,000 people seeking international protection in almost 320 International Protection Accommodation Service (IPAS) centres around the country.  Due to severe shortages of accommodation over recent years, the State was unable to offer accommodation to all people seeking international protection. Single male applicants are most affected by accommodation pressures  While the demand for IPAS accommodation remains high in 2025, the reduced rate of new applications has meant that IPAS has been able to review the cases of people awaiting an offer of accommodation and make offers to those who have been waiting longest.  This review has reduced the number of unaccommodated people from over 3,500 in March 2025, to 613 in October 2025.  This means that eligible people who applied for international protection during 2023 and 2024 and the earlier part of 2025 have received an offer of accommodation.  Depending on availability of spaces and numbers of new applicants, we will continue to make offers of accommodation to more people over the coming weeks and months.  People who are not offered accommodation are given a weekly allowance of €113.80 per week, an increase of €75 more than the standard weekly allowance for asylum-seekers.  IPAS has arrangements in place with a range of NGO partners to provide drop-in day services for unaccommodated people. This means people can access facilities including hot showers, meals and laundry services.  While most applicants are not rough sleeping, IPAS also makes offers of accommodation to any applicant who is, identified through outreach that is organised 7 days a week.  My Department continues to manage a limited supply of accommodation, prioritising people with families or who have specific health needs or other vulnerabilities.  Updated information on unaccommodated international protection applicants is published online at Gov.ie. ",

        "answerText": " Minister for Justice, Home Affairs and Migration  The Government is very conscious of the special place that pets hold in people’s lives, as companions and as a comfort to many.  I recognise that pet theft is an incredibly cruel crime which can cause significant emotional distress to pet owners and their families. It is also a crime which often affects, and is indeed often targeted against, older and particularly vulnerable people, for whom their pet is of huge emotional importance.  The seriousness with which the Government views the issue is reflected in the heavy penalties that can apply to pet theft, with prison sentences of up to ten years for theft and for handling of stolen pets and up to five years for possession of a stolen pet. If a burglary is involved, the sentence may be up to 14 years of imprisonment. When imposing sentences, judges are not limited to considering the monetary value of a pet. The sentimental value and the emotional distress to the victim caused by the offence can be and are taken into account.  I am assured that An Garda Síochána considers the theft of pets as a serious incident and fully investigates all complaints brought to their attention.  The Government and An Garda Síochána are dedicated to preventing the theft of companion animals through a range of measures including microchipping of dogs and awareness campaigns which are led by the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine in conjunction with the Department of Rural and Community Development.  If the work being undertaken by my Government colleagues on this important issue identifies or establishes any evidence-based recommendations for an amendment to criminal legislation, officials in my Department will work collaboratively to establish the best way forward.

Under the NPRO, a phased expansion of the St Lukes Radiation Oncology Network (SLRON) is underway.  The network operates across three sites at Beaumont, St. James’s and St. Luke’s Hospital, Rathgar. The rollout of replacement equipment across the 3 locations is expected to be completed over a 5-year period and installed by Q3 2030, with additional equipment in Beaumont to be completed by Q3 2031. The scope of the programme includes design, construction works and installation of equipment. The HSE has noted that the linear accelerators will take approximately 22-26 weeks each to install.  SLRON is expected to complete Stage 1 of the replacement programme in the coming weeks and subject to completion/approval of the PBC/SAR, commence the procurement process in Q1 2026 with a view to appointing a contractor in Q4 2026.  The delivery of this replacement programme is particularly complex, as upgrade works will be required to the buildings and treatment capacity will have to maintained for patients. In addition, the works and installation of equipment will be undertaken in a live clinical environment. The Government is committed to improving cancer care, ensuring better prevention, maintaining improvements in cancer survival rates, and timely access to treatments, including radiotherapy.

        "answerText": " The Taoiseach  I propose to take Questions Nos. 1 to 14, inclusive, together.  The Cabinet committee on infrastructure last met on Thursday, 17 July and is scheduled to next meet on 3 November. The Cabinet committee works to drive infrastructure delivery and the implementation of the revised national development plan. We are prioritising the delivery of critical, growth-enhancing infrastructure, as outlined in the programme for Government. We have a responsibility to invest in the future and delivery of modern, sustainable and resilient infrastructure is vital for our national competitiveness, fostering regional development, delivering housing and meeting social needs.  The recently published review of the national development plan sets out the largest capital investment in the history of the State to unlock housing, upgrade water and energy infrastructure, deliver more roads and provide better public transport. In budget 2026 we announced €19.1 billion in Exchequer capital investment, an increase of €2 billion on 2025. This represents the highest annual spend to date in this country. Reform of delivery is also key to our approach. The new dedicated infrastructure division in the Department of Public Expenditure, Infrastructure, Public Service Reform and Digitalisation recently published its report outlining the most impactful barriers to infrastructure development, based on extensive consultation. This report has put significant detail behind what we already knew, that delivery of much needed infrastructure is taking too long.  Our regulatory and consent systems have evolved over time to the point where we have a complex landscape, characterised by an increasing number of decisions being referred to the courts for interpretation. All too frequently, this is leading to processes that take too long and an extremely conservative system. Next month, a detailed action plan to begin to tackle these barriers will be published. It will have a focused set of reforms that are practical, time-bound, and impactful. We will be taking action to strike a better balance between the rights of individuals and the public good. We will be simplifying regulation and consenting systems, reducing the administrative burden and cutting the red tape so that our systems are not delaying much-needed investment. The Government has now committed more than €275 billion to investment in infrastructure over the coming decade and the Cabinet committee will oversee the investment and the reforms required to maximise the efficiency with which it is delivered. \n Deputy Peter 'Chap' Cleere  I will speak about the construction of two brand-new multi-storey school buildings for the new post-primary schools, Kilkenny City Vocational School and Coláiste Pobail Osraí. These two schools have to be priority projects. Due to increasing numbers, the situation in these schools is unsustainable. They are currently under pressure to provide for existing and future student needs. The next phase of this project will be to release the funding and appoint the contractor. I hope - please God - that in a short time we will be turning the sod, which will make it real for people on the ground.  I acknowledge that €6 billion has been invested in schools nationally in the past five years and I welcome the July announcement of a further €7.5 billion for the Department of Education and Youth under the national development plan. However, this is a new chapter for both these schools We are looking forward to their development and to welcoming students into new buildings in the not-too-distant future. \n An Ceann Comhairle  Thank you, Deputy. \n Deputy Peter 'Chap' Cleere  We are counting on the Taoiseach's support to get these projects over the line as quickly as possible. \n Deputy Shane Moynihan  I welcome the urgency in the Taoiseach's reply on the need for us to build critical infrastructure to secure the growth of the country. As we seek to build more complex public infrastructure, such as public transport systems like the Luas for Lucan or primary care centres, in rapidly growing communities such as, in my constituency, Saggart, Rathcoole and parts of Citywest, it is important we ensure the international expertise we need to attract to the country to build that infrastructure is not put off by the long planing processes we have in place. If we are not attractive to those international companies and expertise, it will have the knock-on effect of increasing the cost of these projects in the future. We have to be aware of that and keep it to the front of our minds.  I also associate myself with the need for school buildings as a central part of infrastructure. I have raised a number of buildings in my constituency where we need to see progress with the Taoiseach and the Minister for education. Some are more than 40 years old and are in no condition for use at the moment. \n An Ceann Comhairle  Thank you, Deputy. \n Deputy Shane Moynihan  I encourage the Government to prioritise them as a matter of urgency. \n Deputy Séamus McGrath  I thank the Taoiseach for his reply. He mentioned the importance of investing in the future. Critical to that is investment in our city centres. Will he give an update on the task force for Cork city?  The programme for Government states that the model applied to the Dublin city task force will also be applied to Cork and will happen shortly. I hope this task force will deal with such strategic issues as improved transportation connectivity to Cork city, addressing issues around dereliction, vacancy and under-utilisation of buildings, investment in our public realm or streetscape, making the city a more attractive place to be and, critically from a day-to-day point of view, safety in our city centre and improved visibility of gardaí. I commend Cork City Council and Cork Business Association on their initiative of introducing wardens to the city centre recently. It was welcome. I hope the Taoiseach will give an update on when the Cork city task force will move on. \n Deputy Ruairí Ó Murchú  We have to see delivery of the catchment flood risk assessment and management, CFRAM, programme on flood protections, even in the short term. In estates like the one I am from, Bay Estate, there are issues with people trying to get flood insurance. Some who have bought houses recently are looking for letters of comfort which people used to get from the local authority, but are no longer available. The letters are to state the area has not been flooded. That issue needs to be dealt with in relation to the local authorities and insurance companies. However, beyond that we need to see delivery of CFRAM. That part of Dundalk is seriously suffering from the fact it does not have the requisite wastewater infrastructure. When we see heavy rains in my estate, we are incredibly worried about what will happen.  I am still waiting for a follow-up meeting with Uisce Éireann. I hope that will happen in the near future. However, we also need to ensure resourcing and finances are made available. \n Deputy Darren O'Rourke  I raise a number of important issues, including school buildings for Coláiste Ríoga in Dunshaughlin and Dunshaughlin Community National School, which have been waiting for a long time, despite having planning permission as far back as 2020. However, I will focus on the creaking wastewater treatment infrastructure. There have been numerous reports by the Environmental Protection Agency, EPA, and others on the need for investment in this infrastructure. It is welcome that there is a commitment to investment. How will projects be prioritised? I am particularly interested in the need for investment in the Kells wastewater treatment plant and in it happening as quickly as possible. \n Deputy Ruth Coppinger  A document was produced by Fingal County Council which identifies land banks, including one in Dublin 15 which could accommodate 20,000 homes.  Today, I received a reply from Fingal County Council. It has 105 families with termination notices or notices of eviction in Dublin 15 alone. I am coming to the Taoiseach as a TD from that area reporting a humanitarian crisis. I want to highlight some of the cases that our councillors are dealing with due to these notices of termination. One person has a child with cerebral palsy. Another person is in homeless accommodation with children who have no space to move and no area to play. Another person is in homeless accommodation and has to cross the M50 every single day. Another person has a child in an autism unit and, as the Taoiseach knows, it is very hard to get an alternative place if they lose their home. Another woman is still breastfeeding after having her newborn. There are many others with disabilities, autism and neurodiversity. When will we address the fact that instead of throwing money at developers, that money could have been given to councils to develop land banks like this, build real affordable homes and social homes, and end this humanitarian disaster? \n Deputy Paul Murphy  I want to ask about transport infrastructure, of which buses are the easiest, quickest and cheapest part to deploy. Every day, pretty much, I get emails about the state of the bus services in Ballycullen, Knocklyon and Rathfarnham. The 15 bus service is the busiest route in Dublin and the 15B is also grossly overcrowded. What is happening is that buses routinely fill up in the morning after the first few stops and then leave everyone behind at the later stops. This is a daily occurrence. One constituent says:  I now leave home at 7.15 a.m. to get to work for 9 a.m. My home is exactly 5 miles from the GPO. Who is accountable for privatising the buses? I do not remember getting to vote on it. I'm going to lose my job if this goes on.  A student says:  Something needs to be done quickly. I am increasingly desperate, anxious that I will miss something like an exam or something far more important than just a lecture in the near future.  For years, we have been promised that BusConnects is the answer but the A-spine is now delayed until the autumn of 2026 at the earliest, and it will likely be over capacity as soon as it starts. What is the Government planning to do to fix the bus service? \n Deputy Liam Quaide  Our two historic coastal towns in Cork East, Youghal and Cobh, are held back from realising their full potential by the absence of key infrastructural links. For Cobh, it is the lack of a second road access point to the Great Island. For Youghal, it is the failure to restore its rail connection with Midleton and, hence, its isolation from the eventual light rail system in the city. There are real and far-reaching impacts for residents of those towns as a result. They include safety on our congested roads and reduced potential for residential and economic development. In the case of Youghal, the daily quality of life impact of not having rail is grinding and immense. When will the Government show the infrastructural ambition that is needed in east Cork to allow Cobh and Youghal to reach their full, majestic potential? \n Deputy Peadar Tóibín  Storm Babet hit Cork two years ago. It caused damage estimated at about €200 million. It hammered the area, and it is very lucky that nobody was killed. Since then, practically nothing has been done. The area has been promised flood defences for decades but, in the best-case scenario, it is going to take eight years for those flood defences to come into play.  Navan is the largest town in the country without a rail line. More Meath people commute than in any other county and we commute further. Return journey times are about four hours at the moment. The former TD, Noel Dempsey, promised the rail line in 1994 but the best-case scenario is that it will be 2036 before it is built.  The Taoiseach said that the planning process has evolved. The planning process has not evolved. The Government created the planning process. We have the longest planning in Europe. We have the longest licensing and permits system in Europe. We have the longest tendering time in Europe at the moment. It is incredible. The whole system is falling apart. When will the Government reform it to make sure we can build infrastructure properly and on time in this country? \n Deputy Pádraig O'Sullivan  I raised an issue with the Taoiseach three weeks ago regarding the elective hospital in Cork. To be fair, the Taoiseach gave a good response and said it was a political decision that was made on the timing of the hospital, not a HSE decision. As I told the Taoiseach, the hospital was initially meant to take patients in 2027, but it is now looking like 2030 because the project will go from being a one-phase project to a multi-phase project. To be fair, the Taoiseach was quite forceful a number of weeks ago when he gave me his response. However, since that response, nothing has changed. I do not expect things to happen that quickly, to be fair, but the mood music is the same, unfortunately.  I would also reference capital projects in education, whether for ASD classes that were promised last year, extensions to buildings or new-build capital projects. The experience that I am hearing of in the House today is also being experienced by me, particularly in regard to the larger projects.  We talk about delivery here, and the Taoiseach has consistently talked about it since he was elected Taoiseach on the first occasion. Unfortunately, I am just seeing stalling, whether because of bureaucracy in the planning process, cost or issues with implementation. We need to ensure that the delivery is going to happen. \n Deputy Barry Heneghan  It is no surprise that I am bringing up the issue of private wires again. This is something that is going to reduce energy costs and speed up housing supply. It is a win-win for the Irish people. It will bypass bottlenecks in grid connections. I have recently been contacted by people who have solar farms that are waiting 18 to 24 months for connection. It will help businesses with large roof spaces to allow the loads and reduce their carbon footprints. It will also reduce the grid connection. It will enable large batteries for long-term energy storage to be more easily built out for our grid. With our offshore renewable energy, ORE, development, we are going to have huge curtailment. Electrolysis factories can easily be built for green hydrogen with private wires legislation. I urge that my Bill with the OPLA gets pushed through as fast as possible. It is going to benefit the Irish people. \n The Taoiseach  I thank the Deputies for raising these issues. I appreciate the focus from Deputy Cleere on Kilkenny City Vocational School and Coláite Pobail Osraí. I visited these schools many years ago with the late Bobby Aylward. I think his son was working there. I will certainly keep an eye on those and will talk to the Minister for education in respect of them. It is important. Substantial funding has been made available for education on the capital front. If we look at capital, we keep saying that delivery is not happening, and I did say that myself. At the same time, we are now spending the capital that has been allocated over the past two years. In 2020, 2021 and 2022, not all of the capital was spent and it was moved to other Departments to get spent. I refer to the past two to three years. This year, it is €2 billion-plus. We are at €19 billion, so we would have spent €17 billion last year. Inflation has happened and construction inflation has been higher than normal inflation, which has been a problem. The issue of European directives and European frameworks on the environmental side is proving very problematic in terms of flood relief programmes and so on, and there is no point in saying otherwise. I will pursue those.  Deputy Shane Moynihan reflected the idea that if we do not accelerate, we could lose international experience, which we are certainly seeking in respect of the metro and some of the more complex transport projects, such as light rail and so on. We have seen how that has worked in the past in terms of the Luas and other big developments. There are a lot of roadshows going on in terms of the implementation of the planning Act, the commencement of all regulations there, further legislation in respect of judicial review, which the Minister for justice is going to bring in, and the report coming back from the Minister, Deputy Chambers, in respect of removing the barriers and having a programme for the accelerated delivery of infrastructure projects. I know there are a number of school projects in the Deputy’s constituency that he has highlighted.  Deputy Seamus McGrath highlighted the need for investment in city centres. We significantly improved the living city initiative in the budget, which I advocated very strongly for. A lot will depend on the city council getting the maps back as quickly as possible for designation. With regard to shops, there will not be any timeline in respect of the date of the building, so any shop can convert and avail of the scheme. In terms of housing and other buildings, the year is now 1975 as opposed to 1915, so, hopefully, that will create some activity in the five cities and regional centres like Dundalk, Drogheda and other areas.  I have had meetings with the city council. People do not like the word “taskforce” in Cork - we are kind of fussy - so they are looking for a different title because the city has made progress. They had issues with that but, in any case, we are going to set up a group in terms of the roadmap for progress and a fresh approach to Cork city itself. It is important that we get the terms of reference and the focus right. Some work has been undertaken between UCC, the city council, the Cork Business Association and others in respect of how the city should progress. We want to make sure that in what we establish, we capture that and not duplicate or do something on a different strand or track.  The current development plan, up to 2028, is important. We are talking about a world class city driving local and regional growth and embracing diversity and inclusiveness. We have the large-scale regeneration projects in Cork docklands and Tivoli and the development of a much-enhanced, citywide public transport system. A lot of active travel projects have been delivered in Cork city. which is quite good to see. It is about bringing all of that together. I would be particularly interested in the inner city core - that we create new opportunities there. There is more work to be done for towns around the country in that respect. We need to bring more residential back in. This then creates new opportunities for a different kind of retail and hospitality into the future.  Deputy Ó Murchú referenced flood projection and CFRAM. I could not agree with the Deputy more. All the flood relief schemes are slow-moving, by definition, in terms of consultation with various groups, stakeholders and so forth. It is something I have raised with the Attorney General and others in terms of EU frameworks that govern a lot of this. Adaptation and flood relief are critical to the survival of towns and cities. They are urgent because of the impact of climate change, which is very real. \n Deputy Peadar Tóibín  Our averages are higher. \n The Taoiseach  Where we have implemented flood relief schemes, for example, Bandon, which I would be aware of, Fermoy and Clonmel, the impacts have been very significant in protecting those towns. The public good has to take precedence.  Deputy McGreehan raised the growth in population and the issue around wastewater treatment and so forth. Deputy O'Rourke raised the topic of school buildings, including a number in his area, creaking water infrastructure and the Kells wastewater treatment plant. We will be engaging with Irish Water given the additional it has now received.  Deputy Coppinger mentioned Fingal County Council. She said there are 20,000 homes. That is a matter for the council to get going. There is about €11 billion of public expenditure allocated to housing this year between capital, current and Exchequer funding. That is a lot of funding from the State side. We are not throwing money at developers. We are putting a lot of money into housing. We are putting a lot of money into social housing. \n Deputy Ruth Coppinger  They do not have the money for that, though. \n The Taoiseach  We need the private sector as well, in addition to the huge unprecedented public sector investment.  Deputy Paul Murphy raised public transport and the state of the bus services. A lot of investment has gone into the bus services. BusConnects has been slower because there has been huge consultation with people, residents and communities who had issues with BusConnects - let us be honest - and those were legitimate issues. We will continue to prioritise public services. It is not a privatised bus service. There is a substantial Bus Éireann contribution to public buses. Bus Éireann and Iarnród Éireann have expanded.  In reply to Deputy Quaide, there is work under way in respect of the alternative route into Cobh. There is the issue of the rail connection to the Youghal greenway. That is being developed but I get the issue. Cork to Midleton was the first railway expansion in its time and it reversed a trend lasting 50 or 60 years. It has been extremely effective. However, we need to continue to work on the economy within Youghal and create opportunities for people living in the town. It is an iconic and attractive area. That is something we have to continue to work on. We are very focused on the need to get that road situation into Cobh sorted. There are economic implications arising from that, in terms of releasing the docklands, the port, marina point and so on.  Deputy Tóibín raised Storm Babet. I dealt with some aspects of that in terms of the flood defence issues. The county council has worked on certain households and businesses and protecting them as interim steps, but, again, that is a complex scheme. It has numerous challenges and Midleton has numerous challenges in terms of potential flooding risks. That is understood. There is a lot of work going on to try to get that scheme going.  Deputy O'Sullivan raised the elective hospital. I put that back on the map at the time. I am going to pursue this. We have the site, and likewise in Galway. There has been a lot of school expansions in Cork as well. We will continue to focus to get more of those done, and more quickly. There are quite a number on the list that we need to get done. Now, with the allocation that has been given to education, we will certainly keep the pressure on to complete the projects. The Minister of State, Deputy Moynihan, is working particularly on the special education side to get special classes provided and get extensions done to accommodate extra autism classes.  Deputy Heneghen raised private wires. The Minister has got sanction from Cabinet and is progressing with the legislation. This is important because it will help some companies that are waiting for connection and so on. ",

        "answerText": " Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade  Ireland consistently advocates for the promotion and protection of the rights of LGBTIQ+ people in Hungary and throughout the world. Our concerns in relation to serious Rule of Law backsliding, and the targeting of civil society and minority rights in Hungary, have been regularly raised, including in direct contacts with our Hungarian interlocutors.  We are closely monitoring the situation in Hungary and continue to engage with the European Commission and EU Member States, including in relation to the banning of Budapest Pride as well as Pécs Pride. The Irish Embassy in Budapest was represented at both events.  Ireland supports the Commission in Case C-769/22 on the grounds that Hungary's Child Protection Law infringes Article 2 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU) and the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union. This case, taken by the Commission as guardian of the Treaties, addresses important legal questions that are of direct relevance to the current, concerning situation in Hungary.  Though little used, Article 259 of the TFEU provides a specific procedure for a Member State which considers that another Member State has failed to fulfil an obligation under the Treaties to bring the matter before the Court of Justice of the European Union. I believe that the best approach is to work with the suite of instruments available in the EU's Rule of Law toolbox, and I look forward to these being further strengthened but we will keep all available actions under review.  Ireland remains committed to working constructively with the European Commission and other Member States to ensure that EU law is upheld and that concerns are addressed in accordance with the Treaties.

        "answerText": " The Taoiseach  I propose to take Questions Nos. 1 to 12, inclusive, together.  The Cabinet committee on the economy, trade and competitiveness last met on 14 July and the next meeting is scheduled for 27 November. The membership comprises the Taoiseach; Tánaiste; Minister for Finance; Minister Public Expenditure, Infrastructure, Public Service Reform and Digitalisation; Minister for Climate, Energy and the Environment, and for Transport; Minister for Agriculture, Food, Fisheries and the Marine; Minister for Enterprise, Tourism and Employment; Minister for Culture, Communications and Sport; and Minister for Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science. Other Ministers and Ministers of State are invited to attend when requested.  The committee oversees the implementation of the programme for Government commitments related to sustainable economic and employment growth; trade; competitiveness and productivity; innovation; the national digital strategy and pensions.  Despite many external challenges we continue to see strong economic performance with record numbers of people in work, low unemployment and real wage growth. The economy continues to demonstrate its resilience and ability to adapt to changing global circumstances. As evidenced by last week's budget we will continue to advance an economic model founded on a well-established and successful pro-enterprise policy framework, a stable and sustainable regulatory and tax environment with sound management of the public finances and significant investment in the infrastructure, energy and skills required to ensure our future competitiveness and productivity.  In an increasingly unpredictable global economy a proactive approach to market diversification will promote Ireland's economic resilience, foster competitiveness and productivity and strengthen and support our trade and investment model ensuring sustainable growth. For example, last month I met with Prime Minister Carney. While in Ottawa I launched a comprehensive Ireland-Canada economic report. The report highlights that Ireland is now the tenth-largest investor in Canada, with inward investment flows of more than €14 billion. Trade agreements are essential to our efforts to strengthen our economy, increase market diversification, protect jobs and positively benefit enterprises and consumers alike through increasing their options, reducing tariffs and costs and maintaining standards. Irish and European Union exports to the world facilitated by trade agreements support more than 750,000 jobs here, which is approximately one in three jobs. This trade supports real livelihoods.  I ask the Opposition parties why they continually oppose the Canada-European Union Comprehensive Economic and Trade Agreement, CETA, when it has worked both ways and enhanced jobs in Ireland, created more jobs in Ireland and protected jobs. Yet the Opposition parties opposed it all the way. That is completely out of touch with and disconnected from what puts bread on the table in Ireland. We will continue as a Government to invest in the future of Ireland while preserving the jobs, stability and prosperity of today.  As with all policy areas, issues relating to the economy are regularly discussed also at full Cabinet meetings where all formal decisions are made. \n Deputy Malcolm Byrne  I strongly welcome the Taoiseach's commitment to the implementation of CETA and to the growth of our trade relations with Canada. However, I want to raise EU competitiveness. It is over a year since the publication of the Draghi report yet the European Policy Innovation Council, the Brussels-based think-tank states that only 11% of the recommendations are on the road to implementation. We are seriously falling behind in Europe in terms of competitiveness. One of the areas is network resilience and our digital infrastructure. We are shortly to publish the new national digital and AI strategy. The Taoiseach might give us an update on that. As part of Ireland's competitiveness strategy, will the Taoiseach ensure we will have the necessary digital infrastructure to be able to compete in this century? \n Deputy Shane Moynihan  Cuirim failte roimh an dul chun cinn atá á dhéanamh i leith saorthrádáil timpeall an domhain. Key to any free trade and any strong trading relationships is a strong, export-led economy driven by our indigenous firms. While the budget made some moves in increasing the attractiveness of entrepreneurship and developing an entrepreneurial economy, could other issues be considered such as setting up a number of metrics around how we measure the number of employees employed by indigenous SMEs and the proportion of corporation tax those companies pay? Can some funding be allocated or thought given to schemes designed to mentor new entrepreneurs from existing proven entrepreneurs who have been successful in this field? For those companies that we want to scale up and keep in Ireland can the Government make it easier for employee-share options to be made available in those companies to ensure everybody has bought into the success of those companies and that they are allowed to scale up?  We need to scale up our indigenous industry and I encourage the Taoiseach to consider that too. \n Deputy Shay Brennan  Internationally recognised digital hubs like Station F in Paris have profoundly transformed their local and regional economies by attracting start-ups, venture capital and cutting-edge innovation ecosystems. The Government has signalled strong backing for digital hubs as cornerstones of Ireland's economic competitiveness and future growth. Sandyford Business District is at an advanced stage of planning its own large-scale digital innovation campus. This is uniquely suited due to its strategic location, quality infrastructure and well-established international business community. With proactive Government support, Sandyford could emerge as a flagship hub of digital entrepreneurship and innovation on the European stage. How can local stakeholders best engage with and bring this opportunity to the Government's immediate attention to ensure it receives the co-ordinated backing necessary for success? \n Deputy Naoise Ó Cearúil  I spent my summer months drafting my first Bill to establish a national AI office. I was delighted to see on 8 September the Minister, Deputy Peter Burke, announcing that this office will be established. Indeed, in the budget last week funding was allocated for this very office. Can the Cabinet committee consider naming this office an oifig náisiúnta um intleacht shaorga, or ONIS for short? It is a good name, one we can all remember. It also fits with in with Acht na dTeangacha Oifigiúla as well. It is a name people will remember. Making sure it is in Irish will give it that little bit of strength as well. \n Deputy Tony McCormack  Our national success in enterprise depends on our competitiveness and our competitiveness depends on reliable energy infrastructure. In County Offaly we have a great energy infrastructure that is close to capacity. EirGrid is under real pressure to expand it. Offaly’s central location and long history in energy generation means it is ideally placed to help to meet that challenge. Bord na Móna, with its expertise and local presence, could play a key part in strengthening grid capacity across the midlands. I urge the Government to work with Bord na Móna and EirGrid to unlock Offaly’s full potential as an energy investment hub. \n Deputy Ruth Coppinger  The Government took a decision in the budget to give huge tax cuts to developers, the fast food industry and the hospitality sector to boost trade and competitiveness. In doing so, it has made people 2% worse off according to the ESRI and the bottom 10% of society are 4.4% worse off.  I will specifically ask the Taoiseach about electricity. We have the highest electricity costs in the EU and we hear that retail prices are three times higher than wholesale prices. Massive profiteering is taking place in electricity that will increase poverty, but it is also a huge cost on small businesses, which the Government claims it wants to help. When will we have a not-for-profit electricity sector? The Taoiseach talked as if it was a terrible thing in response to an earlier question. It would be hugely supported in society because it is the cost that is worrying people more than anything else. Average bills are also due to increase €207 more than last year with no support. \n An Ceann Comhairle  Thank you, Deputy. \n Deputy Ruth Coppinger  Maybe it is not such a bad idea after all to go back to the model we had in the 1970s and 1980s when people could afford electricity. \n Deputy Darren O'Rourke  In the audiovisual room this afternoon, a briefing organised by Deputy Guirke was addressed by Ciaran Staunton and Kelly Fincham on barriers faced by Irish citizens returning from abroad. They raised a range of barriers, such as access to driving licences and planning permission, but the issue I want to raise that relates to the economy and trade is the dearth of teachers, occupational therapists and other allied health professionals and the recognition of nursing qualifications from abroad. Is that something the Taoiseach can address to allow people to come home and contribute to the economy in the public sector or private sector? \n Deputy Paul Murphy  Education is crucial to competitiveness. We will not have it without teachers, yet many schools are in crisis situations. I will give one example from my constituency. St. Mary's Boys National School in Rathfarnham is set to lose another teacher next year, having lost one in September, unless the Government commits to reducing class sizes. I have been contacted by many parents, one of whom wrote to say:  My son is already in a class that exceeds the national average size. Without intervention, he may soon be placed in an even larger multigrade class, which would significantly affect the quality of his education. The school is currently just four pupils short of retaining its 16 class teachers.  In the budget, it was announced that 1,042 teachers will be hired, which will not cover the 1,046 teachers who will be retiring so it will not reduce the pupil-teacher ratio. The hospitality VAT rate cut cost the equivalent of hiring 7,800 teachers, illustrating where the Government's priorities lie. Will the Taoiseach commit to reducing class sizes? \n Deputy Emer Currie  I raise the deemed disposal rule for exchange traded funds, ETF. I welcome the reduction in the exit tax rate announced in the budget, but the rule itself remains the difficulty. Under the deemed disposal rule, investors are taxed every eight years on gains they have not realised. This creates an opportunity cost for savers. To pay the tax, investors may need to liquidate part of their ETF holdings or use cash that otherwise could have remained invested, meaning the long-term growth is reduced and the benefits of compounding are not fully realised. In both cases, I am told, it penalises prudent, long-term investments. Will the Taoiseach indicate whether the Government has any short- or long-term plans to address the rule? \n Deputy Rose Conway-Walsh  Energy costs in the State are astronomical and are having a detrimental impact on competitiveness. This rip-off of Irish customers was confirmed again today by a recent international report, which revealed that our retail electricity prices are three times higher than wholesale prices, one of the highest price gaps in the world. We are completely exposed to the price of fossil fuels on the international markets and this is driving up the cost of doing business here, with businesses being ripped off.  Decarbonising and renewable energy must be prioritised to address this, but the technology for businesses to decarbonise often requires an upfront investment that is unrealistic and too expensive for many businesses. Existing supports in place from Enterprise Ireland, under the green transition fund among others, are not seeing participation rates that will contribute to Ireland achieving its goals of reducing emissions by 51% by 2030 and climate neutrality by 2050. What additional measures to assist businesses to decarbonise is the Government putting in place to make energy more affordable, reduce the cost of doing business and boost our competitiveness? \n The Taoiseach  I thank all the Deputies who contributed. Deputy Malcolm Byrne was first out of the traps about the 11% of recommendations, which is quite low, implemented from the Draghi report. Ireland is already identifying the Single Market and some of the reforms in the Draghi and Letta reports for our Presidency of the European Union in the latter half of next year. We would like to see an acceleration of the implementation of the recommendations of the Draghi report because they are essential to European Union competitiveness. Draghi pointed out that barriers that exist are much more costly than any tariff imposed by the US, by three times in some cases.  The publication of the digital strategy and of an updated AI strategy is imminent. Aontaím leis an Teachta Shane Moynihan go bhfuil cúrsaí trádála ríthábhachtach ó thaobh cúrsaí geilleagair na tíre. On employee metrics, I fully agree we need to scale up indigenous companies. Looking strategically at the country into the future, there is an inextricable link between multinational investment and our own SMEs or indigenous enterprises. Many of them are part of the supply chain. Many have grown in expertise because of their relationships with multinational companies but there has been in issue with scaling and growing multinationals in such areas as life sciences or technology. The one area in which we have grown multinationals is food- and agriculture-based industries with such examples as Glanbia, Kerry Group and so on. There is certainly an issue in regard to employee share options and so forth.  Enterprise Ireland manages a leadership for growth programme for companies. In the past, they went to Harvard. I met representatives of 35 companies in New York recently. When I was at the UN , we did a bit of work with our companies and 35 are availing of the leadership for growth programme. They are SMEs. I have met many people who have been on that programme over the years and they all say it had a beneficial impact on their mindset, their ambitions as CEOs and how they had been organising their companies up to that point. Mentorship is extremely important and we work with many companies in the US and the larger Irish companies that help us to mentor emerging Irish companies. However, strategically, the future has to be to increase the scaling up of Irish-owned companies for long-term competitiveness.  Deputy Shay Brennan is on a similar mission, with a specific application to Sandyford. I met the owner of Station F recently. He is an innovative medical person. He is one of the first people I have met in Europe who I can say is a real business leader. We generally interact with US behemoths, such as the digital giants Google, Amazon and so on, but here is a French person, a European, who has a clear vision of the enterprise side and the digital side in particular, including incubation and so on. In terms of Sandyford and how to progress, engaging with Enterprise Ireland is critical in the whole area of incubation and supports available from that unit. Linking up with third level institutions is important in that area because it can give added heft and companies can draw on talent, ability and brains on the campus and link them to the business campus. I recommend those two options and if I can be of any help in talking to Enterprise Ireland and going out to see it, I will because the future is in creating hubs like that to enable entrepreneurship to flourish.  We can do more, if I am honest, on budgetary and fiscal policy, but we can only do so much in any one budget. Very often when we do things for entrepreneurship, they get attacked politically as looking after the wealthy or businesses and so on, whereas we are trying to enable an environment where jobs will be created in the future and they are good high-quality jobs.  Deputy  Ó Cearúil's suggestion on the national AI office was excellent. I will talk to the Minister in respect of oifig náisiúnta na h-intleachta saorga. The tuiseal ginideach was spot on. That was the old de Valera policy - name it in Irish and people will cop on and learn a bit of Irish along the way.  It is good news. We made rapid progress on the proposals. Many Deputies recommended the creation and establishment of a national AI office. It is only some months ago it was aired at Leaders’ Questions. We have moved to progressing that and putting it on a statutory basis. I think the AI issue is huge. We have a lot of catching up to do in Europe and in Ireland in respect of AI. There is also the relationship with energy use and AI, which is going to be very challenging, which means we will definitively need offshore wind from 2030 onwards to enable us to avail of the AI revolution. Okay, people will question it. Some are saying now it could be like dot.com, but it is here to stay long term. We need to make sure we can get our heads around it and be part of that agenda into the future. The general view worldwide is that Europe is way behind the United States and China in respect of this.  On Deputy McCormack’s point, because of their previous history Offaly and the midlands is well positioned to become an energy hub using Bord na Móna. I pay tribute to Bord na Móna. As a state company it has transformed very effectively from being a fossil fuel-based company with many climate issues to transforming it to almost the opposite agenda very quickly. It is a very good example of a state company aligning itself with state policy very quickly; not resisting it but going with it. I have been down there quite a lot with Bord na Móna which has enlisted third-party companies which are investing in energy projects in the midlands. The transition programme funding we have received from Europe and, indeed, the national transition funding should help to underpin the continuation of the midlands and Offaly as an energy hub into the future.  Deputy Coppinger spoke about not-for-profit. Someone has to pay in the end. You just cannot magic the grid or investment in it. There is an onus on the Deputy to identify the massive state investment that would be required in addition to what we are investing already to get to a not-for-profit electricity or energy system in Ireland. She referenced the 1970s and 1980s. I was a student in the early 1980s. The 1980s was not a good decade economically. \n Deputy Ruth Coppinger  I know. Fianna Fáil sent a lot of people emigrating. I remember it. \n The Taoiseach  I would not be sentimentally returning to the 1980s as a model for the future. I just would not do that. \n Deputy Ruth Coppinger  You are gas. \n An Ceann Comhairle  Deputy, please. \n The Taoiseach  The population was much lower. There have been dramatic changes in Irish society in terms of population growth, economic growth, the challenge of climate and all of that. It is not as simple as presented. We cannot keep doing one-off budget packages forever. That seems to be the suggestion from the Opposition----- \n Deputy Ruth Coppinger  We are saying to nationalise electricity. \n An Ceann Comhairle  Deputy, please. \n The Taoiseach  -----that we should have a one-off package this year, a one-off package next year and so on. We just cannot continue to do that.  Deputy O’Rourke raised an important issue. The qualifications issue pertains to some of the regulatory bodies in specific areas, namely the Medical Council, the Teaching Council – it may not like me saying this but I think it can be quite conservative – and some of the other bodies such as Coru. I have been in touch with the Minister for Health and the Department is moving on Coru. It says it is moving on therapists, for example. It is interesting. It has taken too long to register people who are clearly well qualified and have good international qualifications in speech and language, physio or occupational therapy and it could be a year or a year and a half before they are recognised here. We must be much more nimble. Then there are things like driving licences and all of that. There is a very legitimate issue in terms of people returning to live in Ireland from overseas and how we can reduce the barriers to them reintegrating into society and facilitating that.  Deputy Murphy spoke about education. If a school is four pupils short, he knows it can appeal on the basis of developing school status to retain a teacher. That system has been there for a long time for retaining teachers. Over the last number of years, we have significantly reduced the pupil teacher ratio. I am not saying that is in this case but sometimes it depends on how a principal or the management of a school will deploy teachers. They may have other priorities and they may do it in different ways. That also happens. In this case the Deputy is saying the school is down a teacher and due to lose again next year. I do not know if that is because of population demographics in the area or not but we are investing a lot in education in recent years and we will continue to do that.  Deputy Currie mentioned the exit tax rate in terms of funds and so on. I think the Finance Bill might be an opportunity for her to press that case with the Minister, Deputy Donohoe. That allows for more detailed examination of issues of that kind. I accept the basic principle that sustainable investment and good practice is what we should be encouraging and facilitating.  To Deputy Conway-Walsh I would say renewable energy is the key. Deputy Conway-Walsh is gone. I am kind of alarmed - there were terrible protests about having Leaders' Questions once a week and so on but the leaders of all the parties are not here at all. There we go. Deputy Conway-Walsh has left after asking her question. She will be back, I think, to be fair. \n An Ceann Comhairle  She is here. \n The Taoiseach  I am sorry, Deputy Conway-Walsh. I was just saying that renewable energy is the key and the green transition is the key. I accept her point. One of the issues we have is the over-reliance on fossil fuel important on a number of fronts. Energy security is the key one, by the way. Everybody here is complaining about the decision to have a LNG facility. It would be utterly irresponsible if we do not develop that. My concern is the time line to develop it because we have no back up if anything was to happen to the interconnectors. That is a big security vulnerability. \n An Ceann Comhairle  We have two questions left with 20 minutes and 30 seconds. ",

Applicants can expect to receive their certificate within around a month of the date of the ceremony.  By not issuing certificates on the day of the ceremonies, my Department has been able to simplify the administrative steps required to be completed on the day. This in turn has made it possible to significantly increase the number of attendees who can attend any one day of ceremonies, and to reduce the time it takes for people to complete the naturalisation process.  These steps are part of an overall programme of work to speed up the naturalisation process for applicants. This includes introducing an online digital application, online payments, and the introduction of eVetting.  My Department held 24 citizenship ceremonies last year, an increase from 15 held in 2023, and 6 in 2022. My Department has already held 19 ceremonies this year and will continue to hold more ceremonies on a regular basis.  In just over two years the Citizenship Division of my Department has gone from processing around 12,000 applications a year to processing over 20,000 applications in 2023 and more than 31,000 decisions in 2024.  My Department is doing everything possible to ensure that new citizens receive their certificates as soon as possible. ",

In the case of annual changes, both the current year and the preceding year are taken into account when deciding whether the estimate should be suppressed or flagged as having a wider margin of error.

        "answerText": " Minister of State at the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage  Public participation is a long established and key element of all substantive decision-making processes under the Planning and Development Act 2000 (Act of 2000) and which will continue under the Planning and Development Act 2024 (Act of 2024). It is open to any person to make a submission or observation in relation to a planning application during the public consultation period and on payment of the required fee. Planning authorities and An Coimisiún Pleanála (the Commission) must have regard to any valid submission or observation made when making a decision to grant or refuse a planning application. In addition, a person who made a submission or observation on a planning application that a planning authority has decided to grant or refuse may subsequently appeal that decision to the Commission or may make a further submission in relation to an appeal of that decision.  The Act of 2024 will introduce new procedures to address 'spurious' planning submissions, appeals and judicial reviews. Section 587 of that Act prohibits a person from requesting from another person a payment, benefit in kind, or conferral of financial or economic benefit in order for that person to not make a planning submission or take a planning appeal or judicial review, or so that person will withdraw such a submission, planning appeal or a judicial review already made or taken. A person who contravenes this prohibition will be liable on summary conviction to a fine not exceeding €5,000 or imprisonment for a term not exceeding 12 months or both. It should be noted that section 587 does not apply to a request made by the owner or occupier of land or a maritime site which is made in good faith for the purpose of compensation for loss of enjoyment of that land or maritime site by the owner or occupier and which is likely to be occasioned by the proposed development.  Furthermore, section 587 also provides that an applicant for planning permission may apply to the High Court for a direction to be issued to a planning authority or the Commission to disregard such a submission or observation and the High Court may direct the Commission to dismiss an appeal in such circumstances. The High Court may also dismiss a judicial review brought where such a request in contravention of section 587 was made.  Section 588 of the Act of 2024 provides that submissions in relation to planning applications, appeals of applications and judicial reviews must be accompanied by a declaration stating that the submission, planning appeal or judicial review is not being made or taken for the purposes of delaying a development or for receiving a payment or other benefit. A declaration must also be made when withdrawing a submission, appeal or a judicial review. A person who fails to comply with these declaration requirements or knowingly makes a false or misleading declaration will be liable, on summary conviction, to a class A fine or to imprisonment for a term not exceeding 12 months or to both.  I am satisfied that the introduction of sections 587 and 587 will contribute significantly to the intended operation of the planning process while ensuring public participation for genuine purposes is maintained.  My Department is in the processes of commencing of the Act of 2024 on a phased basis to facilitate the transition to the new legislation across the planning system, taking into account the need to liaise with local authorities, planning bodies and other stakeholders. It should be noted that the existing provisions in the Act of 2000 will remain in place until repealed and the relevant provisions in the Act of 2024 are commenced. A detailed implementation plan is available at www.gov.ie/planning. ",

On the 4th June 2025, after two years of negotiations on the file, the Council of the European Union agreed their Mandate to enter into negotiations with the Parliament and the Commission.  The Council's mandate was agreed for both the proposal for a Directive on the Union code relating to medicinal products and a Regulation laying down Union procedures for the authorisation and supervision of medicinal products for human use and establishing rules governing the European Medicines Agency . This mandate was supported by 26 Member States, including Ireland.  The wording in Article 1(10)(a) of the Commission’s proposal maintains the text in the current Directive.  The Council’s agreed mandate in June did not propose any change to the wording contained in the Commission’s proposal.  The European Parliament adopted its position in April 2023, proposing hundreds of amendments to the texts, including the deletion of Article 1(10)(a) of the Directive.  Trilogue negotiations between the Institutions are now underway with a view to reaching political agreement on all elements of this important and complex legislative package later this year. Ireland is working intensively with the other Member States to ensure that the final text will provide Europe with a modernised regulatory system for medicines which is in the interests of patients and maintains a strong, innovative pharmaceutical sector in Europe.

        "answerText": " Minister of State at the Department of Health  The Chief Inspector of Social Care and the Health Information Quality Authority (HIQA) is the national independent regulator of designed centres for older people including public community nursing units and private nursing homes.  Department of Health officials directed this query to HIQA who have advised the following:  \"HIQA was established under the Health Act 2007, as amended, to promote safety and quality in the provision of health and personal social services for the benefit of the health and welfare of the public. HIQA’s regulatory role is to regulate designated centres for older people, people with a disability and special care units. HIQA also regulates medical ionising radiation exposure and monitors standards in acute and community hospitals and private hospitals, some children’s social care services and permanent international protection accommodation services (IPAS) centres.  In addition, HIQA has no statutory remit to manage or respond to individual complaints, this is the statutory responsibility of the service provider. However, while we are unable to investigate or resolve individual complaints, we do welcome feedback about centres and services under our remit. We call this ‘unsolicited information’.  All unsolicited information (UROI) received is acknowledged, logged and examined by HIQA. If the information relates to a service within HIQA’s remit, it is reviewed by an inspector to establish if the information received indicates a risk to the safety, effectiveness, and management of the service, and the day-to-day care the resident or patient receives. Unsolicited information received can help inform HIQA’s work to:  - ensure services continue to meet high standards of care for patients and residents  - consider how well providers handle complaints and use them as opportunities to improve care for patients and residents  - identify any trends or patterns that could indicate that something unacceptable is happening in a service  - make decisions when registering and or renewing the registration of designated centres.  If HIQA considers that the service provider may not be compliant with the regulations and or national standards, we can respond by:  - asking the service provider to submit additional information on the issue  - requesting a plan from the service provider outlining how the issue will be investigated and addressed  - using the information on inspection  - carrying out an unannounced inspection to assess the quality and safety of the care being provided in the service.  In addition, where the information indicates that people may be at immediate risk, HIQA will use its full legal powers and report the incident, where appropriate, to An Garda Síochána, the Child and Family Agency (Tusla) or the Health Service Executive (HSE’s) Adult Safeguarding Team.\"   Total number or UROIs per year about designated centres for older people      -    2020    2021    2022    2023    2024    2025(to 30 September)       Total UROIs received     1213    1024    978    1107    1021    894        Number of UROIs per county per year about designated centres for older people       County      2020      2021      2022      2023      2024      2025 (to 30 September)      Total per county 2020-2025 YTD)        Carlow     9    16    14    19    9    9     76        Cavan     20    8    9    8    5    7     57        Clare     49    34    48    45    43    48     267        Cork     112    138    109    160    87    55     661        Donegal     34    29    25    36    26    26     176        Dublin     353    220    218    271    269    257     1588        Galway     48    59    70    78    67    28     350        Kerry     44    31    34    51    26    22     208        Kildare     100    73    61    72    70    47     423        Kilkenny     23    27    25    27    22    34     158        Laois     8    18    12    8    12    51     109        Leitrim     7    3    2    2    2    3     19        Limerick     26    41    30    37    41    40     215        Longford     7    6    15    10    7    6     51        Louth     42    27    22    21    44    16     172        Mayo     28    27    26    26    17    18     142        Meath     81    52    47    44    53    34     311        Monaghan     12    7    10    10    0    6     45        Offaly     17    19    12    12    27    11     98        Roscommon     32    24    22    11    14    17     120        Sligo     8    10    9    11    5    13     56        Tipperary     33    45    29    29    45    61     242        Waterford     16    23    36    53    17    12     157        Westmeath     12    12    12    7    10    10     63        Wexford     37    45    45    33    65    39     264        Wicklow     55    30    36    26    38    24     209         ",

        "answerText": " The Taoiseach  I propose to take Questions Nos. 1 to 10, inclusive, together.  The Cabinet committee on health last met on 17 July and is due to meet again soon. The committee oversees implementation of programme for Government commitments in relation to health, receives detailed reports on identified policy areas and considers health reforms including Sláintecare, the reform of public health and health system preparedness for future health threats. It also receives reports in relation to programme for Government commitments in the areas of mental health and drugs policy. Sláintecare 2025+, our latest Sláintecare strategy published in May 2025, aims to forge the way forward towards accessible, affordable and high-quality healthcare for the people of Ireland when they need it and where they need it. We will deliver faster access to care. Funding of €420 million has been allocated for the waiting list action plan this year. The new regional structures within the HSE have been established, with six new health regions and 20 integrated healthcare areas. Health and social care services are planned and delivered around the specific needs of local populations, leading to better co-ordination of care and access to services. We will continue to review capacity in emergency departments, increase the number of public-only consultants in emergency medicine and ensure more senior staff are rostered in emergency departments during weekends and public holidays for better decision-making. We will continue to build our workforce through the recruitment of key roles, retention measures and additional college places for key disciplines. We will continue to invest in a healthier future, with a national physical activity framework and action plan due to be published in 2025 and a new obesity policy and action plan to be published in 2026. We are launching a new era of innovation and digital transformation in health. The national patient app has been rolled out. The national shared care record is being developed and the electronic health record will also be progressed. Additional projects which are key to the increased digitalisation of the health service include a national system for electronic prescribing and remote health monitoring and virtual care solutions.  In mental health, we will continue to build the mental health workforce and infrastructure and support community-based services. In older people’s services, we will support people to live at home within their own communities and strengthen the nursing home sector. The forthcoming national policy on adult safeguarding for the health and social care sector, a programme for Government commitment, will set out how existing protections will be strengthened. All of these commitments build on the investment and reforms undertaken over the past number of years, including the delivery of approximately 1,330 acute beds, an increased workforce of over 29,000 whole-time equivalents since December 2019, more affordable healthcare through a reduction in the drugs payment scheme threshold to €80, the removal of hospital inpatient charges, the extension of the eligibility for free GP cards for all children under eight and to all earning no more than the median income, State-funded IVF, free contraception for women aged 17 to 35 and free access to HRT. From September 2021 to the end of August 2025, there has been an almost 56% reduction in the number of patients waiting over 12 months. The surgical hub for south Dublin opened in February this year with additional hubs becoming operational in 2026. Care is being delivered closer to home in 180 primary care centres through 96 community health networks. Twenty-seven community specialist teams for older persons and 26 community specialist teams for chronic disease are now operational and 23 community intervention teams are operational, with national coverage secured. We will continue to invest and reform, changing the way our services are delivered this year and into the future \n Deputy Paul McAuliffe  The Taoiseach may be aware that there are four capital projects currently under way in Beaumont Hospital which are at different stages. They include a new emergency department, a new 95-bed ward block, a 64-bed critical care unit and an extension to radiation and oncology departments. Will the Taoiseach give an assurance to the House that these projects will be funded and will be done in a timely way? Despite the complexity of it being a live campus site with services being continued, can we be assured that sufficient supports will be put in place to allow these important extensions to a hospital which serves the north side of Dublin? \n Deputy Ivana Bacik  The Taoiseach outlined some of what the Government has been doing on health. In this budget forthcoming next week, will he clarify if there will be provision to increase the level of GP coverage around the country? I think all of us, in rural and urban areas alike, are hearing about the difficulty in accessing GP services, and about GPs who report being overworked and facing difficulties in establishing practices and in succession. GPs are retiring and are unable to recruit successors. What will be done in the budget for that? I also want to ask about the extension of free GP care to all those under 18. The Taoiseach referred to it in his opening remarks. The Labour Party in particular has been committed to ensuring that roll-out is continued and we are keen to see something in the budget for that. Finally, I return to the question of the inquiry which we welcome for children with scoliosis and spina bifida as a result of the meeting between the Tánaiste and the Minister for Health with the parents of Harvey Morrison Sherratt. I asked earlier for clarification on the publication of the relevant reports. We need a schedule for publication of the Nayagam report. It was commissioned two years ago but we still have not seen it published. \n Deputy Pádraig O'Sullivan  I raise the elective hospitals and surgical hubs that are being delivered across the country, with particular reference to the Cork situation. Initially, in response to parliamentary questions, we were told it was envisaged that patients would be seen by 2027, all going well. The language used in parliamentary questions of late is frustrating and now suggests patients might not be seen until 2030 in the elective hospitals around the country, including that in Cork. It is a commitment in the programme for Government. There is an envelope of €9.25 million under the national development plan up to 2030. We are disappointed that the language is now changing to say that patients will not be seen until the end of this decade. It is incredibly frustrating. There are waiting lists out your ears to get appointments for certain procedures in CUH. We have been told repeatedly that the elective hospital in Glanmire will be a gamechanger. We need to get it back on track to make sure we will not be waiting until 2030. \n Deputy Michael Cahill  There are former residential and reformatory school survivors on hunger strike outside the gates of Leinster House as we speak. I raised this matter last week with the Minister for justice in the Dáil. This is their tenth day on hunger strike. This very serious situation has reached an impasse, with the Minister for education having advised them that their demands cannot be met. The hunger strikers assure me they will see this out to a tragic conclusion if necessary. Is there nothing we can offer them to end this tragic event? After their years of suffering in the control of a State body, they have been left with nothing. Others in similar circumstances have received some compensation. Their demands include each being issued with a HAA card to access comprehensive healthcare and full contributory State pensions to compensate for the years of forced unpaid labour they provided to the State. \n Deputy David Cullinane  There is no family that is not impacted by mental health difficulties and challenges at some point. We know early intervention is key to preventing serious illness, particularly for young people if a mental illness is caught at a young age and the intervention services are available. Jigsaw is an important service as part of the overall supports for young people.  In Waterford, unfortunately, we do not have a Jigsaw service. Waterford is the largest city without that service. Deputy Conor D. McGuinness and I, as well as the Minister of State, Deputy Butler, have raised this issue. I am looking for an update on where that is at.  The second issue I raise is the need to deliver 24-7 cardiac services for the people of Waterford. The Minister committed to doing this, in principle at least. We have the second cath lab but, at this point in time, we do not know when the staff will be hired and what the timeline is. Will the Taoiseach outline when full 24-7 cardiac services will be in place in Waterford and the south east? \n Deputy Peadar Tóibín  I welcome the announcement that there will be an inquiry into the care of spina bifida and scoliosis patients by CHI. It is good news and I give credit to Stephen and Gillian and the advocacy groups for achieving this. It is really important that it be a statutory public inquiry. Any inquiry without the power to compel people or papers will not get to the truth in relation to this. It is also important that the terms of reference are in agreement with the family of Harvey Sherratt and the advocacy groups. We have been here before where terms of reference were promised to be done in agreement with the campaign and then, at the last minute, the group found the terms of reference were not in sympathy with its views. In the case of the Women of Honour, a number of women who were part of that campaign did not agree with the terms of reference. Mention was previously made of the establishment of an office of inquiry. Given that these statutory inquiries can go on at length----- \n An Ceann Comhairle  I call Deputy Emer Currie. \n Deputy Peadar Tóibín  -----it is important that we get to a situation where we have a permanent office of inquiry to make sure----- \n An Ceann Comhairle  Thank you, Deputy Tóibín. \n Deputy Peadar Tóibín  -----these inquiries can be delivered efficiently and speedily. \n Deputy Emer Currie  Approximately 10,000 people in Ireland develop shingles every year, two thirds of them over the age of 50. One in three of us who had chickenpox as children will develop shingles in our lifetime. The national immunisation advisory committee recommends five vaccines for older adults - flu, pneumococcal, Covid, shingles and RSV - yet only three are publicly funded. The shingles vaccine is available only to those who can pay for it, the cost being almost €500. This creates inequity, leaving many unprotected. Ireland is now an outlier, with 15 European countries, including the UK, France, Germany and Italy, already funding shingles vaccination for older and vulnerable people. Will the Taoiseach please consider adding shingles to the vaccination programme? \n Deputy Rose Conway-Walsh  I raise the serious issue of the shortage of beds in Beaumont Hospital. An example of the impact of this shortage is brought home by the very serious case of one of my constituents. I have his family's permission to raise his case with the Taoiseach because they are absolutely desperate. His name is Henry Keane from Blacksod and he was recently diagnosed with a brain tumour. Since 17 September, he has been waiting in Mayo University Hospital for a transfer to Beaumont Hospital. He is listed under a consultant in Beaumont who has accepted the transfer but Beaumont is waiting to have a bed available. There is no bed available. We can imagine what it is like to be lying in a hospital bed not knowing what the future holds, unable to get the treatment you need and not knowing when that treatment will be given. Every day, you wait and hope and, every day, nothing happens. There is no bed for you today. Is that the way we treat our most vulnerable people in 2025? \n An Ceann Comhairle  Before the Taoiseach responds----- \n Deputy Paul Murphy  May I come in on this group of questions, a Cheann Comhairle? \n An Ceann Comhairle  No, I have called nine Deputies. I will call Deputy Murphy on the next group of questions.  If the Taoiseach will allow me the liberty, I acknowledge that the Mexican ambassador, Her Excellency Carolina Zaragoza Flores, has joined us in the Gallery. The ambassador is retiring today. I take the opportunity to thank her for her sterling body of work. Her husband, José, is with her. I thank the ambassador for her kindness to me during her tenure and I wish her all the best in her retirement. \n The Taoiseach  I thank the ambassador for her work over the past number of years. We enjoyed our engagement with her and I really appreciate that.  Deputy McAuliffe raised the issue of Beaumont Hospital. There are four major projects under way there. The national development plan has allocated very substantial funding to the Department of Health and the HSE for the realisation of those projects. The key is to keep the pressure on to get them through the various stages. Health capital tends to be slow and health projects tend to be slow moving. We need to accelerate some of these projects and get them delivered. They are well under way in some respects, with planning going on and so on. I appreciate the point the Deputy made. Beaumont is a national centre for key disciplines and a very important centre.  Deputy Bacik raised the issue of access to and coverage of GP services. In terms of the budget, Estimates discussions are going on. I recall her colleague Senator McDowell saying the Government is being fiscally reckless. He thinks we are spending too much. On the other hand, Deputy Bacik and others will come along and say that we should spend more on health services. Expansion of eligibility and so on will have a cost attached to it. Public expenditure will grow significantly again this year but we have to watch the rate of growth, without question. That will limit what is possible within the health budget in the next couple of weeks and in the announcement in the budget itself. We are endeavouring to have a sustainable health budget along the lines of what we planned over the past two years, which has worked effectively enough in terms of outcomes and improvements and also in terms of fiscal sustainability for the health service. The increase in the budget has been exponential over the past number of years. In my reply, I went through all the various initiatives we have provided in terms of reducing costs for patients. Capacity is very important.  Regarding the inquiry we spoke about earlier into CHI and the publication of reports, I will talk to the Minister in respect of timelines. My understanding is that the Nayagam report will be ready before the end of the year. It needs to be published and it will be important in terms of feeding into any inquiry that will be established.  Deputies Cahill and O'Sullivan referred to the elective hospitals. I will pursue that issue. It is annoying in that going back to 2016 or 2017, there was a different Government planning a second hospital for Cork. We correctly looked at that when we came in after 2020 and we agreed on elective hospitals in Galway and Cork initially and in Dublin subsequently. Those projects have been progressing and are in planning, design and all of that, but they need to get a move on. We have a site in Galway and a site in Cork. The surgical hubs are moving as well. I have made it very clear to officials and to the HSE that these are commitments the Government has decided on and they need to be delivered and implemented. Sometimes, notwithstanding Government decisions, there can be elements in the system who think these things do not have to be delivered. It is my job to sort that out.  Deputy Cahill raised a very difficult and sad situation. I ask that we do everything we can to ask those people to come off hunger strike, which can be very damaging to people's health. There has been a long history of institutional abuse. There have been a lot of supports over the years for survivors of institutional abuse, going back even prior to the report of the Ryan commission being concluded. Redress happened for quite large numbers much in advance of any inquiries. Other initiatives were taken in terms of housing and so on. The Government will engage with the survivors but for their own health and well-being, it is important that they would come off the strike. I understand the Minister met with some of the survivors. I will follow up with her to see what can be done.  Deputy Tóibín spoke about the public inquiry into CHI. I used the words \"timely\" and \"effective\" and the Deputy made the point that he would prefer a permanent office of inquiry. He said inquiries can go on, which they can. We have had statutory public inquiries that have gone on for five or six years. I hope that will not be the case here. The Minister is endeavouring to work with the parents and advocates to see whether we can get a bespoke inquiry that will meet the needs and objectives of such an inquiry, which have to be to improve services and have a sustainable improvement in services for children with spina bifida and requiring spinal surgery.  Because of our Constitution and people's legal entitlements, very often these inquiries can evolve into adversarial-type inquiries. One concern we have, which we need to be very clear-eyed about, is the impact on current services. Presumably any inquiry would involve personnel working in the service. We have got to be very clear-eyed and ensure we design this in such a way that we maintain current services, and that we do not have any negative impact on the provision of services on an ongoing basis. A three-week timeline has been provided for work on this. I am confident that we can arrive at a conclusion to this that would be satisfactory all round. \n Deputy David Cullinane  The Taoiseach left out my questions. This is just a reminder. \n The Taoiseach  I have the reply to Deputy Cullinane somewhere. \n Deputy David Cullinane  The Taoiseach skipped over them. \n The Taoiseach  I apologise. They relate to mental health, early intervention and Jigsaw. I will talk to the Minister. There has been a significant growth in Jigsaw services across the country. I will talk to the Minister in respect of Waterford. I agree with the sentiments the Deputy has articulated. Jigsaw is a very good organisation. It has got a lot of good State support in recent years.  A decision has been taken on 24-7 cardiac services. Deputy Cullinane asked about the implementation and delivery of it. A lot of progress has been made on this agenda. I can see that all of the Deputies in Waterford work together. I appreciate that. We will keep the pressure on to get this done in a reasonable timeline.  Deputy Currie raised shingles. Again, we are now into costs. The health budget was €1.3 billion last year. It is an enormous budget. We have done a lot in recent years. I am a great believer in vaccines. They can save money too in terms of people having to be treated subsequently in the acute care system if they develop something like shingles, which can be very serious in its effect on the immune system, elderly people, and those with RSV in particular.  Deputy Conway-Walsh referred to the shortage of beds in Beaumont Hospital. I will speak to the Minister for Health. I ask the Deputy to send the details in respect of Mr. Keane to the Minister. It is shocking that he is waiting since 17 September. He obviously requires specialist care in Beaumont. We will see what can be done in that case. I take the Deputy's point. That relates to the first question I was asked by Deputy McAuliffe about projects that are under way in Beaumont to increase bed capacity and to get a greater flow of patients. ",

        "answerText": " The Taoiseach  I propose to take Questions Nos. 11 to 20, inclusive, together.  Ireland has accepted challenging emissions reduction targets at EU and national levels. Our programme for Government has reaffirmed the Government's determination that Ireland will play its full part in tackling what is a global issue.  We are seeing encouraging signs. Ireland's emissions have been falling for the last three years, and we now have lower overall emissions than at any point in the last 35 years, despite our population growing by 50% over that period.  Change is under way across our economy and society to realign ourselves to a low-carbon future. Reducing emissions is now at the heart of all our policies and sectors. We are seeing real progress in the areas of energy, transport, and agriculture; however, EPA projections make clear one thing: we must move faster and do more if we are to meet our targets for emissions reduction.  The Cabinet committee on climate action, environment and energy oversees implementation of programme for Government commitments on the environment, climate action, energy and emergency planning. It considers the wide range of issues that require action in Ireland's transition to a low-carbon, climate resilient and sustainable future: a future in which we take full advantage of the renewable energy potential that we possess, while ensuring that energy policies contribute to energy security, affordability and competitiveness.  The Cabinet committee also oversees implementation of the climate action plan. The committee meets quarterly. The last meeting took place on 7 July. The next meeting will be scheduled in due course. \n Deputy Peter 'Chap' Cleere  We all know there is a huge amount of work to be done on flood protection and flood mitigation. I acknowledge the €1.3 billion that has been set aside under the flood risk investment programme. Flooding in Ireland can have a significant impact on homes, businesses, people and communities. While I accept the problem of flooding cannot be eliminated, it can be managed or mitigated to reduce its likelihood, severity or impact. Flood relief schemes are complex projects. They require detailed engineering analysis and public engagement to make sure schemes will work and have the support of the whole community. Six such schemes have been approved in County Kilkenny – in Graiguenamanagh, Ballyhale, Freshford, Inistioge, Piltown and Thomastown. They are all at various stages. Could the Taoiseach give assurances to me and the people of Kilkenny today that these approved projects will be completed and fully funded? \n Deputy Malcolm Byrne  I am glad to see the Government has agreed to progress with the private wires Bill and the development of a private wires policy. It is critical to addressing the energy deficit we face that we move as soon as possible. It is also important that we ensure we have the necessary digital infrastructure to support the digital economy, and that includes data centres. I am sure the Taoiseach would agree with me that data centres, as a critical part of the economy, would benefit from the private wires Bill, in particular if they partner with renewable energy sources in order to be able to power them but also to engage in district heating systems such as the one we see in Tallaght. Could the Taoiseach indicate a timeframe for when we will be moving forward with the private wires legislation and when we may see companies being able to avail of it? In that context, would he envisage nuclear energy forming part of the solution? \n Deputy Naoise Ó Cearúil  In 2004 the Taoiseach introduced the smoking ban, which has saved thousands of lives. This week the EPA reported that approximately 1,700 premature deaths occur in Ireland every year due to poor air quality. A lot of this is due to the continuous burning of solid fossil fuels and traffic emissions. Will the Cabinet committee on climate action, environment and energy consider this report and look at actions to try to resolve it? \n Deputy Tony McCormack  The SEAI better energy warmer homes scheme is crucial for tackling climate change and energy poverty but in Offaly and across the country families are waiting up to two years for works to be completed - 12 months for a BER assessment, 14 months for a survey and further delays for retrofitting. Could the Taoiseach outline what steps are being taken, be it increasing the number of assessors and surveyors, streamlining the process or boosting delivery capacity to shorten waiting times so households can benefit much sooner from warmer, more energy efficient homes? \n Deputy Darren O'Rourke  There is a major issue with the retrofitting schemes that are in place. On the one hand, as the Climate Change Advisory Council states, the funding supports for heat pumps are not sufficient and this lock many people out of access to a heat pump. On the other hand, a heat pump is not a practical or feasible solution for many homes, in particular one-off rural homes. Very many people are locked out of access to a heat pump, but also locked out of low-emission and zero-emission alternatives, whatever they might be. The vast majority still have fossil fuels. There is potential for a significant improvement on what families are currently using, be it dirty solid fuels or kerosine. Will the Taoiseach consider reviewing the schemes to ensure that people can make progress? \n Deputy Ivana Bacik  The European Environment Agency's recent report is nothing short of damning. It sets out the reality for biodiversity and finds that Ireland's natural environment is in very poor condition. Some 85% of protected habitats and almost one third of protected species have an unfavourable status. It is clear that excessive car dependency, unsustainable food production and emissions that are simply not reducing at a fast enough rate are doing untold damage to biodiversity. We are seeing an outrageous situation in Dublin Bay with sewage being pumped into our waters. Swim bans are the norm on far too many beaches and there are fish kills on lakes and rivers with alarming regularity. We need urgent systemic action in this budget.  We need to ensure the budget will take climate seriously. Will the Taoiseach take the urgent action in this budget, which is so obviously needed, to invest in the protection of biodiversity and to reverse some of the decisions made? We are very concerned that the ban on imported fracked gas has been overturned and that it looks as if his Government is opening the door to more fossil fuel infrastructure. \n Deputy Paul Murphy  I welcome to the Gallery the relatives of the participants in the Global Sumud Flotilla.  The EU confirmed this week that nature in this country is in a very poor state and that economic growth has been achieved at the expense of the environment. Even in that context, the Blackwater fish kill stands out as an unprecedented ecocide - over 46,000 dead fish floating to the surface, bringing home the mass extinction event happening silently every day due to intensive, industrialised agriculture. It is incredible that none of our State agencies apparently can find the culprit. These are the agencies that are supposed to protect our environment. No wonder locals, anglers and environmentalists are convinced there must be a cover-up. It is scandalous that the investigations have discovered several other criminal polluters that we would never have known about without this event. What is the Taoiseach going to do about this? Will he properly resource protection and enforcement? Will he ensure that repeat offenders, like North Cork Creameries, which has had 122 non-compliance issues and is still non-compliant, are prosecuted and have their licences revoked? Will he stop defending the nitrates derogation and accept it is contributing to the devastation of our rivers? \n The Taoiseach  Deputy Cleere was the first into the fray, regarding flood schemes in Kilkenny. He gave a very articulate presentation of the challenges and complexities of flood schemes. They take a lot of time and consultation. Given the frequency and ferocity of storms today, we need to move faster with some of these schemes, because the devastation of a flood on a household or on a town, or on shops and businesses, is huge and shocking for people. The national development plan, NDP, has allocated substantial money and capital. We want to get all of those schemes approved. I do not have clear details as to where each scheme is right now. I have no doubt Deputy Cleere does, as he is a local TD for the area. He has listed six schemes. I will work with him to ensure those schemes are approved, fully funded and delivered. A lot will depend on the progress in terms of the execution of the issues.  Deputy Malcolm Byrne raised the issue of a private wires Bill. I think it is good legislation and I welcome the fact the Government has accepted a memorandum outlining the legislation and proposals and that we have agreed it, in that respect. We have challenges in terms of data centres, as Deputy Byrne knows. He has been specialising in AI for quite some time. AI will mean a much greater need for energy. It will be energy intensive. Data centres are going to be important in that regard. Offshore wind energy is critical for this. That is why I have convened a clearing house, involving industry and the Government, to deal with macro issues around delivering offshore wind generation as quickly as we possibly can to enable us to be adopters of AI and to maximise the potential of AI into the future. It will also allow us to deal with future industry needs in terms of major, larger sites the IDA will be acquiring to provide for industry well into the future. We have been working with the Commission for Regulation of Utilities, CRU, the Department of enterprise and others on that specific issue. I will come back to Deputy Byrne on the timeline for the legislation. My understanding is that it should not take that long.  On nuclear, we may very well import nuclear through various connectors. We are putting a lot of funding into wind energy, offshore wind in particular, and some onshore wind and some solar. It is interesting. There are people who have come to me in the House saying they are against solar energy, wind energy and fossil fuels. I do not know where we are going to get our energy if we do not have a combination of all three in the short term. We will need a combination of all three. From a State perspective, nuclear would entail a lot of capital investment. We are putting a lot of capital investment into the wind energy side. A lot of it will be private sector developed, but we have to do the ports and a lot of other stuff with that.  Deputy Naoise Ó Cearúil asked a question around premature deaths. The last Government did enact comprehensive legislation in respect of towns, and to make fully nationwide the ban on solid fuels. A lot of it was coming in from the North, actually, and it was leading to a deterioration in health quality. It was way back in the early 1990s that Mary Harney, the then Minister of State, brought in a ban in cities. People may not remember, but at 5 o'clock on a winter evening in Dublin you could hardly walk through Dublin because of the smog. You were breathing in awful stuff, and it was a radical move that improved health quality in cities. The issue will be enforcement. Local authorities and others need to do more on enforcement regarding air quality in towns across the country. Up to a couple of years ago, Enniscorthy had poor quality air on a par with some towns in India, because of the penetration of imported smoky coal getting in under the radar, not being properly monitored and a lack of enforcement. That is critical for health. Deaths, lung injury and COPD can be avoided if we just do the sensible thing.  Deputy Tony McCormack asked about the delays in delivering the SEAI, Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland, grants and the better energy warmer homes scheme. I take his point. The Minister is reviewing these schemes to see if he can get simpler grant schemes in place and maybe fast-track some of this. We will work on that. I appreciate the point Deputy McCormack has raised.  Deputy O'Rourke raised retrofitting heat pumps and an insufficiency of money. Again, huge money has gone into this in the last five years compared with what went on for the previous 20 years. There are limits to what the State can do with public expenditure, to remind the House of that every now and again. I am sure the Deputy reads the comments from the Irish Fiscal Advisory Council, the Economic and Social Research Institute, ESRI, and the Central Bank. They are suggesting - even a Deputy from the Labour Party has been very conscious about this - that we are spending far too much money on all of these schemes. We do need to be fiscally sustainable. That said, these are important schemes because they save energy in the future and save on household bills for people.  Deputy Bacik raised the issue of the natural environment. In the last five years, we have doubled the budget of the National Parks and Wildlife Service. I involved myself five years ago and met the NPWS. A board was created within the Department. It is an agency within the State. It has had lots of successes. For example, there has been good progress with the corncrake and the white-tailed eagle. We have created new national parks in the last number of years in the north east, and acquired the Conor Pass and marshes around Clonakilty. A lot of good progress has been made. We are dealing with the previous 20-odd years of progress and so on. The Infrastructure, Climate and Nature Fund needs to allocate money specifically for nature restoration and, in my view, for the acquisition of more land for rewilding and for national parks. We will continue on that track. Obviously, I am concerned about the report, and we need to respond to it.  Deputy Murphy raised the issue of the fish kill in the Blackwater, which is absolutely shocking but the EPA, Environmental Protection Agency, has not come up with a culprit for this. It is wrong to just throw up the charge of a cover-up. I do not think that is fair. I do not think it is fair on the EPA because I do not believe the EPA would cover it up. Equally, however, if the EPA cannot pinpoint the exact source of this pollution, it needs to be honest about that too. There is no point in getting ahead. Deputy Murphy would be the first person, in other walks of life, attacking the Garda or the justice system for getting ahead without any evidence. We have to have an evidence-based approach to this. North Cork Creameries has been involved in other compliance issues but not this one. There has been no tracing of it to this fish kill. It employs a lot of people and has been a very successful industry at other levels in that area, which is an area that has not been blessed with multinationals or with other industry. We have to balance the perspective. There is no evidence this fish kill was caused by the agriculture sector either, in terms of farming or anything like that, which the Deputy might have been suggesting, or maybe he had other targets in that regard.  That said, it is not satisfactory that we do not know how such a large fish kill happened. That is a worry. Is our scientific capacity up to speed? This is a major kill and will have major repercussions for biodiversity along the Blackwater and that area in its entirety. \n An Leas-Cheann Comhairle  The next group of questions is Nos. 21 to 32 but we only have five minutes left for this item of business. Therefore, with the agreement of the House, I will move to the next piece of business, which is the motion. Is that agreed? Agreed.  That concludes questions. \n Deputy Paul Murphy  It is agreed, but it is not satisfactory that we only ever get through two groups of questions. We are even losing five minutes today. We used to get six Question Time sessions per week. The Government got rid of Wednesday's Question Time against our objections. We are down to just Tuesday for Taoiseach's Questions and now, more weeks than not, we get through two groupings rather than three. It is on us as well, but we need to have a discussion about it. We should try to get through three groupings. \n An Leas-Cheann Comhairle  I suggest the Deputy raise it with the Ceann Comhairle or at the Business Committee meeting----- \n Deputy Paul Murphy  I have. \n An Leas-Cheann Comhairle  -----or maybe he can just be more efficient with the use of time. \n Deputy Ivana Bacik  It is unsatisfactory. I add my voice to that. We do need to raise this at the Business Committee. Clearly, the debate on the motion on the flotilla is hugely important. We all looked for that so on this occasion, there is no difficulty with moving straight to that debate. However, in principle, to have just two groupings of Taoiseach's Questions when we have all prepared for three is not acceptable and we need to change that. \n An Leas-Cheann Comhairle  Yes, but I have asked Members to bear in mind that they make contributions on the questions. There is an issue there as well. As I said, the Ceann Comhairle can deal with it in the context of the Business Committee or Members who are on that committee can raise it. \n The Taoiseach  I was up late last night preparing for the third grouping after watching the presidential debate. \n An Leas-Cheann Comhairle  I am sure you were. We can take it if you wish. \n The Taoiseach  It is fine. \n Deputy Ivana Bacik  I hope he watched the debate. It was very good. \n Deputy Paul Murphy  He tweeted about it anyway, although it looked like he did not watch it. \n The Taoiseach  I watched it and then I worked on the parliamentary questions. ",

        "answerText": " Minister for Justice, Home Affairs and Migration  The Government is committed to ensuring that communities are safe. Tackling anti-social behaviour is an important part of that commitment.  The Government is taking a number of ongoing actions to ensure safer communities and public spaces, including:  • Getting more Gardaí on our streets through increased recruitment.  • Introducing Community Safety Partnerships around the country, to develop Community Safety Plans for every area.  • Continuing the expansion of youth justice and youth diversion measures.  • Piloting Garda body-cams in three locations (Dublin, Waterford, Limerick) with national roll-out to follow.  • Providing €1 million in 2025 for local authorities to apply for Community CCTV.  The Government continues to invest in the expansion of youth justice and youth diversion measures, including the full coverage of Youth Diversion Projects nationwide, a focus on early intervention and preventative work and proposals to develop diversion-based responses for young adults aged 18-24.  As of 31 July 2025, there are 731 members of An Garda Síochána based in the Dublin Metropolitan Region South Central Division, an increase of 16% since 2015. This figure includes 43 Community Gardaí.  I have been assured by the Garda Commissioner that the high visibility policing plan in place in Central Dublin will continue and the Commissioner has stated that this plan will be replicated in other areas of the DMR.  A long-term strategic approach to anti-social behaviour in communities assists in addressing potential problems before they arise, so An Garda Síochána work collaboratively with Local Authorities, community leaders and groups to find solutions to problems associated with anti-social behaviour.  Local Community Safety Partnerships (LCSP) represent a significant step towards a more collaborative, responsive, and locally driven model of public safety. They will play a major role in enhancing public safety alongside An Garda Síochána, residents, businesses and state agencies.  In June of this year, I signed regulations that provide for the establishment of Local Community Safety Partnerships in each local authority area across the country. I appointed the members of the first Local Community Safety Partnerships in recent weeks and aim to have all of the Partnerships up and running in the coming months.  My Department has also examined and introduced initiatives to tackle the misuse of scramblers and quadbikes, knife crime, responses to ASB impacts on housing complexes and the powers available to An Garda Síochána in relation to public order offences. New laws were introduced in 2024 which criminalise the grooming of children into crime. In addition, the Greentown project, which aims to break the link between children and the gangs that seek to recruit them, was extended in 2024 for a further 3 years. ",

The OPW has provided defibrillators at a large number of the managed sites and offices under its direct control. Life-saving Automated External Defibrillators (AEDs) for cardiac emergencies are in place at the OPW headquarters building in Trim, Co. Meath and at offices at 1GQ Dublin, Claremorris Co.

The installation of defibrillators at OPW heritage sites has been done over time on a case by case basis with an emphasis on sites and locations that have significant footfall. In recent years the aim is to add AEDs to as many of the heritage sites as possible. The OPW has already provided defibrillators at the most frequently visited heritage sites that it manages.

        "answerText": " Minister for Social Protection  The State Pension (Contributory) (SPC) is funded from the Social Insurance Fund through the contributions paid by workers. The rate of payment reflects the number of social insurance contributions paid over a working life. Eligibility for SPC is based on a number of criteria:  • Being aged 66 or over,  • Having entered the Social Insurance system 10 years before drawdown of SPC, and  • Having a minimum of 520 paid social insurance contributions (i.e., 10 years reckonable PRSI contributions).  This Government acknowledges the important role that family carers play and is fully committed to supporting them in that role. Once a person has met the minimum requirement of 520 paid contributions, the State Pension system gives significant recognition to those whose work history includes extended periods outside of paid employment, often to raise families or in a full-time caring role including:  • PRSI credits (which include Credits for Carers Benefit and Carers Allowance).  • Homemaking Disregards and HomeCaring Periods to recognise caring periods of up to 20 years outside of paid employment in the calculation of a payment rate.  Despite these measures, some long-term carers of incapacitated dependants faced barriers in accessing the SPC. They may, for example, have difficulty establishing the minimum number of 10 years paid contributions.  As part of its work, the Commission on Pensions, which was established in November 2020, examined how people who have provided long-term care for incapacitated dependants, the majority of whom are women, could be accommodated within the State Pension system in recognition of the enormous value of the work carried out by them.  The Commission engaged in a public consultation process and had the benefit of presentations from Family Carer’s Ireland and the National Women’s Council in forming its recommendations on the proposals and the period of care. The Commission recommended that long-term carers should be given access to SPC and defined long-term caring as caring for more than 20 years. Setting the criteria of more than 20 years is in recognition of the existing access to SPC for carers who may have up to 20 years of caring periods.  Since January 2024, long-term carer's contributions can be awarded to a person who has cared for an incapacitated person for a period of 20 years or more. These contributions are treated the same as paid contributions for State Pension (Contributory) entitlement only and can be used to fill any gaps in a person's contribution record, including satisfying the minimum 520 contributions required for eligibility.  There are no limits on the amount of long-term carer's contributions that a person may avail of, allowing those who have cared for most of their adult life to qualify for the pension at the maximum rate of pay if they have a combined 40 years worth of paid contributions and/or long-term carer's contributions.  Where a person reaches State Pension age and does not satisfy the conditions to qualify for State Pension (Contributory) or qualifies for less than the maximum rate, they may instead qualify for one of the following:  • The State Pension (Non-Contributory) which is a means-tested payment (based on their share of household means) with a maximum payment of above 96% of the State Pension (Contributory); or  • An increase for a qualified adult (IQA) (based on their own means), amounting up to 90% of a full rate State Pension (Contributory) where their spouse has a contributory pension; or  • Where their spouse/civil partner is deceased, a widow's/widower's/civil partner's contributory pension, which they may claim either based on their spouse's or their own social insurance record. The qualifying conditions for this require fewer contributions paid (260) than the SPC for the maximum personal rate for those aged 66 or over.  This combination of all of the above measures ensures that no person with a viable income need falls outside these schemes.  I trust this clarifies the matter for the Deputy. ",

        "answerText": " Minister for Justice, Home Affairs and Migration  I condemn in the strongest terms any acts of vandalism or theft involving life saving equipment such as defibrillators and life buoys.  I am advised that a person who damages life saving equipment is liable to prosecution for an offence of criminal damage under section 2 of the Criminal Damage Act 1991. A person convicted of such an offence is liable on summary conviction to a fine not exceeding €2,500 or imprisonment for a term not exceeding 12 months or both. On conviction on indictment, the general penalty is a fine not exceeding €22,220 or imprisonment for a term not exceeding 10 years or both. Where the offence committed involves arson or where the damage is committed with the intent by the damage to endanger the life of another or being reckless as to whether the life of another would be thereby endangered, the person concerned is liable to a fine or imprisonment for life or both.  I am also advised that a person who engages in the theft of lifesaving equipment is liable to prosecution for an offence of theft under section 4 of the Criminal Justice (Theft and Fraud Offences) Act 2001. A person convicted of such an offence is liable on summary conviction to a Class A fine (up to €5000) or imprisonment for a term not exceeding 12 months or both such fine and imprisonment. On conviction on indictment, the penalty is a fine or imprisonment for a term not exceeding 10 years or both.  The investigation of any allegations of offences committed under these Acts is an operational policing matter for an Garda Síochána. I would encourage anyone with knowledge of damage or vandalism of life saving equipment to report this to the local Garda station.  It is always the case that the adequacy of legislation is kept under ongoing review, including the associated sentences.  With respect to the final part of the Deputy's question, it is important to note that under the provisions of the Courts Service Act 1998, management of the courts is the responsibility of the Courts Service, which is independent in exercising its functions. It is a matter for the Courts and the presiding Judge to assess individual cases, including the intentions of persons in circumstances as outlined by the Deputy. ",
