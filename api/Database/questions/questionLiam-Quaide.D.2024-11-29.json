        "answerText": " Deputy Liam Quaide  Has the Minister undertaken an equality and human rights impact assessment of the Department's practice of locating people with intellectual and similar disabilities in excess of 100 km from their home in residential services for prolonged periods of time? Will she comment on her Department's failure to maintain even broad-brush statistics on these distances given their clear breach of the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, UNCRPD, which enshrines the right of community living for people with a disability? \n Minister of State at the Department of Children, Disability and Equality (Deputy Emer Higgins)  I thank the Deputy for raising this question and providing me with an opportunity to speak on this matter. The Government is committed to supporting people with disabilities through the implementation of the UNCRPD.  To further the work in this area the Department of Children, Disability and Equality has recently published the National Human Rights Strategy for Disabled People 2025-2030. This includes commitments to promote independent living and active participation and supports our obligations under Article 19 of the UNCRPD. Demand for residential placements is very high for a number of reasons, including demographic challenges associated with the increase in the number of people living with a disability, changing needs and the increase in age profile of those in existing placements.  The HSE advises that while every effort is made by the referring agency to ensure the provision of residential services is close to family and natural supports, taking will and preference into account, there are multiple important factors to be considered simultaneously in order to achieve a residential placement that will best meet the unique and assessed needs and requirements of each individual. Prior to placement, consultation with the individual and their family is undertaken and consent is documented as part of the decision-making process. A comprehensive needs assessment is undertaken by the multidisciplinary team to determine suitability and impact on the individual and their family. Funded placement reviews focus on areas such as the individual’s well-being and continuity of supports, in accordance with the national standards and Health Act regulations.  The HSE advises that each case is reviewed regularly where a transition closer to home is the will and preference of the individual. These actions are aligned with the principles of the UNCRPD and the HSE’s commitment to equality and human rights. In recognition of the impact that distance can have on people and their loved ones, HSE south west has recently engaged with a private provider to purchase houses in Cork to create capacity in order for people to be repatriated to their home county and create additional new placements. HSE mid-west also confirms it is endeavouring to offer individuals the option of living in residential services closer to their communities through capacity building. \n Deputy Liam Quaide  I thank the Minister of State for her response. It is very concerning to hear of the rapidly increasing investment by her Department in privately outsourced residential services for people with disabilities. In many cases a person will move into such a service in the context of a crisis. The HSE will be under pressure to find any place for the person. The residential service they are offered will quite likely be located extremely far from home and sometimes in quite an isolated setting that is not joined up to community or other supports that would allow a person to grow towards increasing independence, connection and integration. We have a scenario where very wealthy private companies are amassing large sums of money with which they are building up significant property portfolios while section 38 and 39 services are struggling to keep the lights on and sometimes paying rent on properties. This is a disjointed, costly and reactive way to provide these services. When will the Government devise a national disability service plan that is implemented through multiannual funding and when will it move away from private outsourcing, which comes with such a human cost to the person with a disability as well as such a financial cost to the State? \n Deputy Emer Higgins  I thank the Deputy. While the chief inspector of social services within HIQA does not have the remit to look at the specific issue of an individual’s distance from their original home, where inspectors see that residents are away from their support network or having to travel extended distances to their family, work or school, it is addressed in inspection reports under regulation 9 on residents’ rights and regulation 13 on general welfare and development.  On private and not-for-profit providers, the proportion of residential placements for people with disabilities provided by for-profit providers has increased in recent years. This has been in response to demand for new residential places. We have 1,988 residential placements being provided by private providers. This constitutes 15% of the total of all placements and represents an increase of 3% since December 2023, so while it is rising it is rising at 3% over two years. \n Deputy Liam Quaide  I thank the Minister of State. The Minister said in a recent budget Estimate session that she wants to move away from private outsourcing but the proportion of money the Department is spending on these services has nearly doubled over the past four years. While the Minister is saying one thing, her Department's actions are the opposite. I can understand the ongoing reliance on these providers but this will not change as long as the Department is devoid of a plan for residential, vocational and community support services that are integrated with each other in each community. We need a service plan for disability akin to A Vision for Change. That document had key staffing targets per mental health service and per head of population. We have a very haphazard pattern of disability services in different areas based, essentially, on a tradition of the service being in that territory. When is the Department going to provide data - even general data - on the distance between a disabled person's house and their community of origin? This is a human rights issue and data on it should be recorded. \n Deputy Emer Higgins  On data, I wish to be clear that the cost of care is completely dependent on the level of complexity and the support required. It is imperative to note that as a result, cost is not a reflection of performance and rather is indicative of individualised care needs. What is most important here is the person with the care need at the heart of this. The Deputy has the data on the average cost of residential places. That data is published and publicly available. The Department of Children, Disability and Equality's spending review 2025 contains this information, which is publicly available on our website. It should be noted these average costs are derived from a relatively small sample of placements from 2024 because there is a relatively small sample of placements in existence. ",

        "answerText": " Minister of State at the Department of Children, Disability and Equality  Day Services are part of a suite of support services that enable people with specialist disability service needs to live within the community. The New Directions Policy, which was published in 2013 , outlines the manner in which adults with disabilities receive disability day services. This policy is underpinned by the values of person centredness, community inclusion, active citizenship and quality. Each person should have access to flexible and outcome-driven supports to enable them to live a life of their choosing that meets their own wishes, aspirations and needs.  In 2025 , it is expected that there will be Day Services provided for 20,600 individuals with a disability – up from just over 19,500 in 2024 - together with a further over 2,000 in Rehabilitative Training services. These services are provided at almost 1,300 locations around the country by 97 service provider agencies. Adult day services and RT programmes are delivered by a combination of the HSE, Section 38 and, Section 39 organisations, as well as private providers.  Funding is allocated each year to provide HSE adult disability day service supports to over 1,700 people leaving school and Rehabilitative Training annually. Placements are identified by the local HSE Day Opportunities teams in line with the person’s support needs and within the funding available. Each person should have a Person Centred Plan (PCP) and be supported to achieve that plan with the aim to support people in “living ordinary lives in ordinary places”.  Where a person presents with complex support needs, or where there may not be sufficient capacity or suitable supports within existing HSE-funded services in the local area, it may be necessary to contract a private provider to ensure that their needs are met.  From 2021 to 2024 not-for-profit organisations were funded to provide Day Services to around 6,000 new school leavers. In the same period, private providers were contracted to provide new day service placements to 198 new school leavers with an establishment cost of €6.9 million .  In 2021, 9 private providers were contracted to support 29 new school leavers at a cost of €1.2m.  In 2022, 8 private providers were contracted to support 46 new school leavers at a cost of €1.5m.  In 2023, 7 private providers were contracted to support 33 new school leavers at a cost of €1.2m.  In 2024, 15 private providers were contracted to support 90 new school leavers at a cost of €3m.  The figures for 2025 are not yet available as the commencement process for the 2025 school leaver cohort is ongoing.  This Government’s ambition is to bring about a step-change in services for people with a disability in Ireland and it is committed to the expansion and reform of disability services in order to maximise people’s independence and help support them to live their lives on the same basis as every other citizen.  This is reflected in the very significant investment being made in specialist disability services in recent years with record investment of €3.2bn in 2025 alone. ",

        "answerText": " Minister of State at the Department of Children, Disability and Equality  The Government recognises the need for reform of the Assessment of Need process to ensure the effective and efficient delivery of assessment of need reports to children and their families.  It is important to emphasise that children do not require an Assessment of Need to access health services , including Primary Care, Children’s Disability Network Teams or Mental Health Services.  Section 8 of the Disability Act, 2005 makes provision for the carrying out of Assessments of Need, including the appointment of assessment officers by the HSE. They are responsible for carrying out assessments of applicants for assessments of need or for arranging for them to be carried out by other persons with appropriate experience. The latter can include the procurement of clinical assessments from private providers.  Clinical assessments undertaken as part of the Assessment of Need process can be provided by both private providers and HSE clinicians. Data is not currently available on the number of completed assessment reports where clinical assessments from private providers were requested.  Notwithstanding this, the HSE assessment officers are solely responsible for the production of assessment reports as set out in Section 8(7) of the Act.  Since 2022, there has been a noticeable increase in the number of completed assessments of need with a 30% increase in 2024 compared to 2023. This trend has continued this year with a 57% increase in completed assessments in the first nine months of the year compared to 2024.  • 2020: 3,911  • 2021: 8,353  • 2022: 3,071  • 2023: 3,205  • 2024: 4,162  • 2025: 4,544 (to end September)  The HSE reports that funding was provided in a number of years to address overdue Assessment of Need applications, including:  • In 2020, funding of €7.8m was provided for both the public system and for the procurement of clinical assessments from private providers  • In 2022, funding of €11m was provided to commission clinical assessments from the private sector, with a focus on diagnostic autism assessments  The Assessment of Need Targeted Waitlist Initiative was introduced in May 2024 to support the delivery of Assessments of Need to those families who have been waiting longest. Under this Initiative, the HSE provides for the procurement of clinical assessments from approved private providers.  In 2024, funding of €8.23m was provided under the Initiative while €14.7m has been utilised to the end of September 2025.  Recent HSE data shows that over 6,300 clinical assessments have been commissioned from private providers since the Initiative started in June 2024. Budget 2026 provides for the continuation of this Initiative next year with €20 million provided for the delivery of some 6,000 clinical assessments.  Ensuring that there are sufficient resources allocated to the delivery of the Assessment of Need process, both in terms of staffing and financial resources, continues to be focus for the Department and the HSE.  In 2026, the HSE is establishing eleven new teams, initially, to support HSE assessment processes, including Assessments of Need. Each team will include a psychologist, a speech and language therapist, an occupational therapist, and an administrator, to provide clinical guidance where required throughout the process.  Work is also ongoing to increase the staffing capacity of the HSE Assessment of Need Teams including assessment officers, liaison officers and administrative supports.  The provision of an effective and efficient Assessment of Need system continues to be a priority for Government. ",

The EU’s new approach to investment protection includes the Investment Court System (ICS), which will replace the long-standing Investor-State Dispute Settlement or ISDS mechanism. The European Union and its Member States are keenly aware of the criticisms of the ISDS system. To overcome the shortcomings attributed to the ISDS system, the EU and its Member States have put forward new reforms addressing these concerns head-on. This new, progressive system contains investment protection provisions that are balanced against a State’s right to regulate in the public interest.  The Government is currently progressing the Arbitration (Amendment) Bill 2025 in Dáil Éireann as part of ongoing efforts to take forward ratification of the EU-Canada Comprehensive Economic and Trade Agreement (CETA) and other international agreements containing similar ICS investment dispute resolution provisions. The preparation of this Bill has been informed by careful assessment.  These agreements include clearly defined investment protection standards, including on fair and equitable treatment, and provide clear guidance to standing dispute resolution Tribunals on how these standards should be applied. Furthermore, in order to ensure that Tribunals in all circumstances respect the intent of the Parties, the agreements establishing these Tribunals include provisions that provide for the issuance of binding notes of interpretation where serious concerns have arisen as regards matters of interpretation. In the case of CETA, the Joint Interpretative Instrument confirms that “ Canada and the European Union and its Member States are committed to using these provisions to avoid and correct any misinterpretation of CETA by Tribunals. ”  These agreements include provisions that affirm that the Parties preserve their rights to regulate for public policy purposes. They also provide that investment protection provisions shall not be interpreted as a commitment from governments that their legal frameworks will remain unchanged.

The agreements further clarify that the fact that a measure may negatively affect an investment or affect an investor’s expectations of profits is not sufficient to say that the measure is inconsistent with the agreement.

Each Member State has different rules regarding treaties, both the joining and exiting of them. In Ireland’s case, a decision to withdraw from an international treaty, such as the Energy Charter Treaty, is a matter of executive power under Article 29 of the Irish Constitution and will require a Government Decision.  Given her formal role in international treaties, a Memorandum for Government regarding the formal exit from the Treaty will be brought by my colleague the Minister for Foreign Affairs and this decision will formally end Ireland’s membership. My officials are working with the Department of Foreign Affairs to expedite this process.  The Government is committed to exiting the ECT as soon as is practicable and the relevant Memorandum is expected to be brought to Government in the near future.  Ireland is still a member of the Treaty and will remain so until we officially leave. The modernised treaty provides for less exposure to investor claims than the original treaty, and the modernised Treaty is available to view on the ECT website. However, the Government's position remains that Ireland will exit the Treaty. ",

        "answerText": " Minister for Enterprise, Tourism and Employment  IDA Ireland’s mission is to promote Ireland and its regions as a premier destination for investment, facilitate the expansion of multinational companies, and nurture long-term relationships with key industry leaders. The agency operates a network of offices across the United States and Canada, engaging with a diverse range of sectors including technology, life sciences, financial services, and advanced manufacturing.  In Canada, IDA Ireland is co-located with Enterprise Ireland in Toronto and its presence in Canada is being reviewed by the IDA as part of the Government’s Market Diversification Action Plan.  This year, the IDA launched its new strategy, ‘Adapt Intelligently’ with goals of strengthening long term investments, scaling cutting edge innovation, driving sustainable change and to maximising regional opportunities. With this focus, the IDA advocates Ireland as an attractive, stable, and innovative gateway to the European market, leveraging Ireland’s highly skilled workforce, business-friendly environment, and robust regulatory framework.  Canada is an important source of Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) for Ireland with the number of new IDA clients originating from Canada growing steadily over the last number of years, due to the growing links between the two economies and increased opportunities between Canada and Europe.  Ireland is an attractive location for Canadian companies to invest due to access to the European/EU Market, the deep talent pool available and to grow and serve the customer base in a business friendly and pro-enterprise country.  At the end of 2024, IDA supported 65 Canadian operations employing 7,056 people. Canadian Inward Investment into Ireland has grown steadily over the last number of years and IDA’s Canadian investors include some of the strongest companies in Canada including: 6 of the Top 10 Canadian companies (by market cap); 4 of the top 5 Canadian banks; and 4 of the top 5 Canadian software companies.  There is a strong regional aspect to Canadian investment with 40% of client operations and 70% of employment by Canadian companies based outside of Dublin. The Canadian market is particularly strong in sectors such as ICT, financial services, fintech, business services and industrial technologies. These companies are engaged in a range of functions in Ireland including EMEA Headquarters, European sales & marketing, Manufacturing, R&D, Software Development and Business Services.  The outlook for Canadian investment in Ireland is positive, and IDA Ireland continues to engage confidentially with many companies on an ongoing basis to discuss potential investments.  IDA does not publicly disclose the names of companies it engages with, to respect confidentiality, protect business-sensitive information and for competitive reasons.  When a company is ready to announce significant investment and growth plans in Ireland, IDA supports this to maximise the impact of all announcements.  The table below, outlines public announcements made by Canadian companies since 2018 to-date in 2025.   Announcements made by Canadian companies in Ireland since 2018 to 2025      2018    SOTI – R&D Hub in Galway  Trulioo – EU HQ in Dublin  Telus International – Expanding in Cork  Circle K – Couche Tard – Expanding through Acquisition      2019    TD Bank – Expanding in Dublin  Greenfield Global – EMEA HQ in Ireland  Manulife Investment Management – EU Offices Dublin      2020    Bathfitter – EU HQ in Limerick  Greenfield Gobal – EMEA Manufacturing in Portlaoise      2021    Telus Digital - Expanding in Mayo  Bausch & Lomb – Expaning in Waterford  N’ware – EMEA HQ in Laois      2022    Telus International – Expanding in Ireland  Sun Life – Sustainability Investment in Waterford  RBC – Expanding through Acquisition  Clearco – EU HQ      2023    Zymeworks – EU HQ in Dublin  Sun Life – 25th Anniversary in Waterford  Clio – 10 years of success in Europe  OpenText – Expanding through Acquisition in Cork      2024    Element Fleet Management – EU HQ in Dublin  Mark Anthony Brands International – Expanding in Dublin      2025    Klohn Crippen Berger – EMEA Office in Dublin  Trulioo – New HQ in Dublin  Clio – New HQ and Expanding  Valsoft – Expanding through Acquisition       As the Deputy may be aware I led a joint Enterprise Ireland and IDA Ireland four-day Trade Mission to Toronto and Ottawa in November, to boost trade relationships, promote world class Irish companies to the Canadian market and highlight Ireland’s attractiveness for Canadian companies seeking to expand to Europe. With Ireland is poised to fully ratify the Canada-EU Comprehensive Economic and Trade Agreement (CETA) - enterprise.gov.ie/en/what-we-do/trade-investment/free-trade-agreements/ceta.html - in 2026, the recent trade mission underscored a shared goal of deepening investment, expanding procurement access, and creating jobs on both sides of the Atlantic.  Insofar as Enterprise Ireland is concerned, EI has had a presence in Montreal since 2020, and in Toronto since 2006, to promote the potential of the Canadian market for Irish businesses. The recent Trade Mission to Canada reaffirmed Enterprise Ireland’s commitment to strengthening bilateral trade, promoting world-class innovation, and supporting the continued diversification of Irish companies in one of the world’s most dynamic and growing markets.  More than 500 Enterprise Ireland clients have done business in the Canadian market in the last three years, and Canada is increasingly recognised by EI Clients as being a stable market, technology forward and generally have a favourable economic outlook.  Although not brokered by Enterprise Ireland, a Canadian company known as Sofina through its acquisition of Eight Fifty Food Group in 2021, is now the ultimate parent of four Enterprise Ireland client companies: Callan Bacon, Karro McGee, M&M Walshe and Carroll Cuisine.  Also, the Mark Anthony Brand acquired 100% of an EI client company Glendalough Distilleries in 2019.

      "question": {
        "answerText": " Minister for Justice, Home Affairs and Migration  The General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) is an EU wide instrument and Member States, including Ireland, cannot deviate from its provisions. Commencement of section 30 of the Data Protection Act 2018 has been raised previously by way of parliamentary question and the position, as outlined at that time, remains the same. Should section 30 be commenced, Ireland could face the serious risk of infringement proceedings and the potential for significant penalties against the State.  Processing of personal data for marketing and profiling purposes takes place under Article 6(1)(f) (“legitimate interests” ground) of the GDPR, with the case law of the European Court of Justice underlining the importance of free movement of personal data and establishing that Member States are not permitted to impose additional conditions that would have the effect of amending the scope of any of the grounds now set out in Article 6.1 of the GDPR. The Office of the Attorney General has also previously advised my Department that section 30 of the 2018 Act appears to go beyond the margin of discretion afforded to Member States in giving further effect to the GDPR and would conflict with Article 6(1)(f), read alongside Recital (47).  Additionally, the European Commission has confirmed that processing of personal data for direct marketing purposes may be regarded as being carried out for a legitimate interest and that Article 6(1)(f) of the GDPR does not make the processing of personal data of a child for the purposes of direct marketing unlawful. The EU Commission also indicated that subject to Article 22 (automated decision-making), processing of personal data of a child for the purposes of profiling is not generally prohibited, albeit the processing must take into account that children merit specific protection as clarified in recital (38). Moreover, the Commission has indicated that the term \"micro-targeting\", as referenced in Section 30 of the Act, is not mentioned in the GDPR, as such its scope remains uncertain and undefined.  Put simply, it is not an option for a Member State to unilaterally prohibit a category of processing activities which might otherwise be lawful under Article 6(1)(f). The commencement of section 30 could, therefore, give rise to a substantial risk of infringement proceedings against the State pursuant to Article 258 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union.  Notwithstanding the above-mentioned issues with section 30 of the Data Protection Act 2018, the protection of minors is a priority for the Data Protection Commission (DPC). For example, in early December 2025, the DPC launched a nationwide awareness campaign to highlight the potential risks and consequences of sharing of personal information, photos and videos by parents of their children online.  Furthermore, apart from this apparent conflict with the GDPR, the Office of the Attorney General has advised that section 30 gives rise to difficulties under Article 38.1 of the Constitution and under Article 7 of the European Convention on Human Rights. Article 38.1 provides that no person shall be tried on any criminal charge save in due course of law. For a domestic offence provision to comply with Article 38.1, it must be clear, precise and foreseeable in its application. It is not clear under section 30 what might constitute the processing of personal data of a child for the purposes of micro-targeting. It is also a requirement under Article 7 of the Convention that offence provisions must be sufficiently clear and precise to enable individuals to ascertain which conduct constitutes a criminal offence and to foresee the consequences of engaging in such conduct.  Finally, since the last parliamentary question on this matter, the Digital Services Act (DSA) has come into force across the EU. The DSA is a key EU Regulation designed to regulate and harmonise how digital and online platforms operate and engage with users. The DSA contains many features dedicated to the protection of minors. These include obligations to implement privacy by design, provide default high security settings for minors, a prohibition on profiling minors for targeted ads and requirements around age warnings and a possibility for the implementation of age verification measures.  Coimisiún na Meán is Ireland's designated Digital Services Coordinator (DSC) under the DSA and is responsible for overseeing and enforcing DSA rules for online platforms established in Ireland. Coimisiún na Meán has also published guidelines on the protection of minors under the DSA: digital-strategy.ec.europa.eu/en/library/commission-publishes-guidelines-protection-minors. ",

        "answerText": " The Taoiseach  I propose to take Questions Nos. 1 to 15, inclusive, together.  The Cabinet committee on housing last met yesterday, Monday, 15 December. The committee works to ensure a cross-Government approach to the implementation of our commitments regarding housing policy. This week’s meeting was specifically focused on our homelessness challenge, in particular the national housing plan commitments in this regard, including the development of a homeless prevention framework and a child and family homelessness action plan.  We are making good progress on the delivery of homes to those most in need across the country, with the new housing plan committed to delivering 72,000 social homes over its lifetime. However, as we increase supply, we also recognise that those experiencing, or at risk of, homelessness have a wide and complex variety of needs. We need to ensure that the appropriate services and policies are in place to support them. Housing is our single biggest issue as a country, with profound social and economic consequences. That is why it is at the centre of the Government’s focus.  Along with the largest ever commitment on social housing, the new national housing plan commits to delivering 300,000 new homes, including 90,000 affordable supports to help people who are struggling to have a home of their own. The plan sets out the highest ever commitment of State funding for housing, with €28 billion over the next five years, coupled with additional funding through State vehicles, including the Land Development Agency, the Housing Finance Agency, Home Building Finance Ireland, the First Home Scheme and the Irish Strategic Investment Fund. Housing delivery, along with infrastructure and utility investment to enable delivery at scale, is at the core of the agreed national development plan published in July, and, at €275 billion, the largest ever capital injection in the history of the State.  To build homes at the scale now required, we need improved and more resilient water, energy and transport services. We will see large-scale investment in all of these areas over the coming years. Last month under price review 6, the investment plan for energy infrastructure was finalised, including funding allocations of up to €18 billion to ESB and EirGrid, leveraged by the Government injection of €3.5 billion in equity to these companies. This will enable thousands more homes to be connected to the grid.  We have also published the investment plan for water, which sets out over €12 billion investment in our water infrastructure, the majority of which will support the delivery of our housing targets. In addition, we are tackling barriers to delivery, through the accelerating infrastructure report and action plan, which includes reforms which will support public and private sector delivery of homes at scale.  Housing is at the centre of the State’s investment and focus for the coming years. However, to meet our targets, we will also need significant delivery from the private sector and we have implemented a number of measures and reforms in support of this. We have focused on making apartment delivery more financially viable, reformed our planning process and created a stable policy environment to enable the private sector to deliver at scale.  We are seeing indications now that our measures are beginning to take effect, evidenced by CSO data showing that we have had an increase of almost 30% in homes approved for planning in quarter 3 of this year, in comparison with the same time period last year, with the number of apartments approved up by over 50%. These are clear indications of confidence. Work is under way to zone a significantly higher quantum of land across the country. Now is the time for ambitious execution, and we have set out a clear framework and roadmap for the coming years to do this. I am confident that we can build on our success to date and bring about a very significant scale-up in our delivery of housing over the lifetime of this Government. \n Deputy Séamus McGrath  I thank the Taoiseach. I welcome today's announcement in relation to the vacant property refurbishment grant and the extension of this grant until 2030. This provides important certainty from a policy point of view in relation to vacant properties. We know they are still a very significant challenge. I also welcome the new initiative in relation to the above the shop grant. Up to €140,000, where multiple properties are involved, is potentially available. That is very significant and the fact that it will be available by quarter 1 of the new year is very important. It is important to look at the local authorities and their resourcing in terms of being able to deal with this grant. I ask the Taoiseach to also look at that. We want these grants to be processed in a timely manner so that we can get on with utilising this currently under-occupied space. The resourcing of local authorities is important and I ask the Taoiseach to look at that. \n Deputy Paul McAuliffe  In my constituency between Shanowen Road and Collins Avenue there are proposals to build new apartment developments. While the additional new housing is incredibly welcome, unfortunately the under-utilised industrial estate there is currently occupied by Santry Boxing Club. Would the Taoiseach agree as well as powering ahead with the provision of new housing, Dublin City Council needs to have a more proactive strategy of making land available to sports clubs so they can avail of programmes like the sports capital grant? Santry Boxing Club is an amazing local facility and will be a great facility for those new homes that will be built. As well as enabling new homes, we need to put in place new facilities, and Dublin City Council needs to be more proactive in making land available to sports clubs. \n Deputy Shane Moynihan  As the Taoiseach said, the delivery of housing is the number one priority for this Government. That is why it is strategically important that all sectors of the Government support that aim, namely through the national development plan's transport sectoral plan, which was published recently. In my constituency, which the Taoiseach visited, we see it as one of the fastest-growing constituencies in the country, with large developments like Adamstown and Clonburris flying ahead. In its county development plans, South Dublin County Council is setting very ambitious targets for zoning. The key to enabling this zoning and to enabling delivery of those homes is the deployment and development of DART+ South West as a transport programme, to intensify the capacity on that line, not only benefitting commuters in Dublin Mid-West but also Kildare North, Dublin South-Central and Dublin-Central.  I am asking the Taoiseach for his support to do all we can to prioritise and bring forward, where possible, the delivery of Dart+ South West as a long overdue infrastructure requirement to not only allow catch-up on public transport in my area but also to plan for the future. \n Deputy John Connolly  One of the actions in the recently published housing plan is that the Department will be publishing quarterly and annual performance tables for new-build output versus targets per local authority, thereby ensuring transparency and accountability.  I understand that will commence next June in relation to social housing. We should also provide similar tables in relation to affordable housing. The local authorities should also be assessed on their output of affordable housing. What actions will the Government take with local authorities that are not meeting their housing targets? \n Deputy Ryan O'Meara  Last February the Government announced its intention to remove the requirement for planning permission for log cabins and modular homes in backyard developments. By the end of the Christmas recess, it will be nearly a year since we heard that announcement. One-off houses in rural Ireland can benefit if we allow log cabins and modular homes to be built not just in backyard developments. They are also one of the few affordable houses out there for young people in rural Ireland whom I speak to. I could give numerous examples of log cabins and modular homes across north Tipperary and north-west Kilkenny that are at threat of enforcement proceedings because they do not have planning permission. Enforcement should not be ongoing until we know what these regulations say. In addition, the development contributions for one-off rural houses should be scrapped again. They are simply a privilege for building on your own land. First, will we see these planning regulations that will exempt log cabins? Second, will this go beyond backyard developments and allow them in rural areas? Third, when will we see the regulations? \n An Ceann Comhairle  I call Deputy Ruth Coppinger. One question. \n Deputy Ruth Coppinger  I also send my solidarity to the Jewish community in Sydney following the appalling attack.  I am sure the Taoiseach agrees with me that cities should be liveable and should have culture as well as venues where people can meet, socialise and enjoy themselves. Will the Cabinet committee on housing and local government discuss the issue of The Complex, a very important cultural space in our capital where artists are currently housed but have been given an eviction notice for the middle of January? A protest on this will come to the Dáil tomorrow. I have attended meetings and other get-togethers in The Complex. In fact, it was the venue for the launch of one of the presidential campaigns. Dublin City Council is open to buying The Complex but only if it can be given 80% to 90% of the funding. We need to intervene to buy this for €10 million. It would be €80 million to buy or to build a similar space. \n Deputy Rose Conway-Walsh  I ask the Taoiseach to consider issuing an upfront fund to local authorities, but to Mayo County Council in particular, in order that they can turn around the vacant properties they have without having to go through the bureaucratic nightmare of applying for funding from central government on a house-by-house, unit-by-unit basis. Can the Taoiseach imagine what it is like to be a homeless person in Mayo watching council houses remain empty month after month while nothing is done? I will give him an example from a young mother in my constituency:  I am homeless, living in a friend's house. I've just had my first baby. She's now a month old. She was born at 36 weeks. I've been in and out of hospital the whole of the pregnancy with stress and anxiety. I developed diabetes also. I was rushed to a Dublin hospital for a week from bleeding and pains. I had a terrible experience. A lot of this stress has been brought on because of my homeless situation.  That is the case for many people. \n Deputy Barry Heneghan  I too join in the condolences on the attack that happened on the Jewish community in Australia.  I also support the plea for funding for The Complex.  Regarding the Cabinet committee on housing, across the country AHBs have signed turnkey deals that then collapse. In Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown, there was a recent scheme that had the contract signed, everything was above board, they were all ready and, at the last minute, when they were looking for funding, the Department denied the funding for 40 turnkey units. If we are to bring medium-sized and small developers into the market, this risk cannot be acceptable. We will not get the funding from the funding schemes, and it is putting all the risk on the developers. The homes are built, the deal collapses and the investor walks away. We want these small-scale developers to meet the housing targets. I have hundreds of people in my constituency looking for affordable housing, and this cannot happen. \n Deputy Darren O'Rourke  I want to raise the issue of child homelessness. In October there were 5,274 children in emergency accommodation. More than 150 of those were in my county, Meath. There is an expectation that at Christmas there will be more than 5,000 and that almost 1,000 of those will be in emergency accommodation for their second or third Christmas. Are there specific measures the Government will take in advance of Christmas, now a handful of days away, to minimise the number of children in homelessness this Christmas? \n Deputy Ruairí Ó Murchú  We all know the issue that exists in relation to housing, whether it is homelessness, the lack of supply, those who cannot get houses, whether from a rental point of view or a purchase point of view, and those languishing on social housing lists. However, we also have to look at the issue of estate management. I do not believe the local authorities, like Louth County Council, have the necessary powers when dealing with chaotic tenants. They may need supports, but even beyond that, we have seen outright criminality and drug-dealing. We know that AHBs have greater levels of power even in relation to the nuclear action of eviction. That should be the last thing that is looked at but, at the end of the day, it is a requirement. I have worked alongside the Louth local authority, the Garda and others in dealing with some situations and we have attempted to move people sideways to deal with the issue. Some very good work has been done, but we do not have the necessary tools, and that is the problem. \n Deputy Liam Quaide  One of the most infuriating parts of the housing crisis is the tens of thousands of properties that have been left idle and decaying throughout the country. Youghal's potential to be on a par with Kinsale for economic prosperity and tourism has been thwarted by the epic scale of dereliction that has been allowed to take place there over many years. Likewise, Castlemartyr and Midleton have many prime-location properties left like deserted husks where boutiques could be flourishing or community hubs or accommodation created. In Holland or Germany this would not be tolerated. Landlords would have to sell up or repurpose a vacant property within a reasonable period or face losing it. The Government's softly-softly approach to vacancy and dereliction is clearly not working, and our towns and villages are haunted by this policy failure. We need to see swift direct action by our local authorities with landlords who blight our streets with decaying properties and a much more urgent pursuit of derelict site levies. The collection of derelict site levies by Revenue is welcome, but why is the Government waiting until 2027 to implement this? \n Deputy Peadar Tóibín  The housing crisis has had varied and wide ramifications in Irish society. One of them is a serious fall in the fertility rate in this State. There has been a 30% fall in the number of births annually. There has been a 20,000 fall in the number of births annually since Celtic tiger times. Some 69% of people aged 25 years or under are living with their parents. Well over 40% of adults who are under 30 are living with their parents. That is changing the very nature of Irish society. The ability for adults to form relationships to have children is being deleted for hundreds of thousands of people. This is having massive ramifications. Schools are now noticing that there is a fall in the number of children being enrolled. An unbalanced demographic structure has serious consequences for our workforce and our pensions. Planning, permitting, licensing, tendering and judicial reviews here are among the slowest in the whole of the European Union. While the Taoiseach's Government has announced plans, they are not ambitious enough and I do not believe they will be implemented in a timely fashion. \n The Taoiseach  There were quite a number of questions there, beginning with Deputy Séamus McGrath. I welcome also the good initiative we have announced today, namely the extension of the vacant refurbishment grant to 2030, but specifically on the commercial properties and the €140,000 plus a €5,000 grant for assistance to support the owner to design a project. The Deputy is right in saying that we need to make sure that the local authorities prioritise this - in other words, that they put a project manager or whatever in charge of this operation in the towns and the cities to make this a reality. It needs to be driven with someone who is accountable and who is doing this every single day, in my view. I will talk to the Minister about that.  We need to alert all the business committees in towns and cities because people need to know. If you combine it with the living city initiative, there are real prospects of, once and for all, getting activity in towns and city centres to address dereliction and allow for change of use. Due to changing patterns of trade and so on, many commercial uses are no longer sustainable, so there is an opportunity for increased numbers residential units in towns and cities.  Deputy McAuliffe raised the topic of the Santry Boxing Club. I was recently with the Land Development Agency, LDA, on the southside, where an existing boxing club has been incorporated into a housing development. A new boxing club is being built in the housing development. That is the way to go. Is the local authority involved in the specific development to which the Deputy referred? It is. The local authority should look seriously at that example. Amenities matter in communities and society. They give young people opportunities. It seems to me that some accommodation must be made for Santry Boxing Club. The other example was a good initiative. The name of the boxing club escapes me now, but the people will have a first-class boxing club as a result of the development. It might be a bigger development. In fairness to the LDA, it saw that needed to be done. The Deputy might give me the details.  Deputy Shane Moynihan spoke about the interdependence of the national transport plan in terms of infrastructure and housing delivery. Housing delivery will depend on infrastructure delivery. I am acutely aware of planning considerations. South Dublin County Council is looking at 10,000 to 18,000 new zonings for housing. That will be dependent on DART+ South West. I have had meetings with the Minister for public expenditure and the Minister for climate and transport, Deputy Darragh O'Brien, to ensure we can underpin the development of DART+ South West. We can make progress on that to give the certainty that the council, Deputy Moynihan and the people in the area require.  Deputy Connolly asked about quarterly tables for social housing. He asked about applying such an approach to affordable housing. I will talk to the Minister. It is a fair point. The councils control a bit more for social housing, but outputs should be across the board. The first issue is to highlight those councils that are not performing. It becomes fairly obvious in a league table scenario which councils are not performing. The actions can take a number of forms. We have to work through the actions. There could be disincentives or limited finance. We have to work through that, but there must be consequences or direct action from the State to override councils that are not performing in respect of housing more generally.  Deputy O'Meara spoke about log cabins and modular homes. I hope that the Minister will in February have a list of exempted developments. I understand it has expanded significantly. There have been a lot of submissions from Government Departments and agencies, particularly those with acute issues, including health, for example, where we need urgent public services. The Minister recently indicated to me that it would be February that we will have completion of that. It is fairly complex and much bigger than we originally anticipated.  The rural housing guidelines need to be published. I have asked the Minister to prioritise that. I fully accept what the Deputy is saying about the potential for enabling and helping young people in rural Ireland to afford housing at a reasonable cost when it comes to buying or renting. We will keep an eye on that. We will look at the development levies over time in respect of rural buildings on people's land although services of one kind or another are required.  I fundamentally agree with Deputy Coppinger that cities should be liveable and that there should be strong social support and creative cultural amenities. The Deputy said the local authority is depending on someone else. Other local authorities tend to get on with it and are in a position to facilitate either the acquisition or purchase of a building without having to do the simple equation and getting the Department to pay out for every single acquisition. The Minister for public expenditure has taken an interest in this issue. I will check the current lie of the land in respect of the Complex. I know Deputy Heneghan also raised that issue.  To Deputy Conway-Walsh, I say that there is no reason why voids should take so long. There has to be some framework of control for the Department. We discovered recently with the tenant in situ scheme that houses were being bought with people living in them. Those houses are bought by councils and suddenly there is €80,000 or €100,000 going into the house. The original objective of that was to stop people going into homelessness. When a local authority house becomes vacant, unless there is something majorly wrong structurally, it should be occupied within a month. We have given huge money to local authorities for voids over the past five years. They should get on with it. They let the houses lie idle for too long. It is inexcusable. In some councils, there is inertia. I have seen it. People leave very good houses for one reason or another, the shutters go up and the houses are left there for three or four months. Those houses should be reoccupied once the electrics and everything else are grand. If we have to get around to repairing them, we can at least give someone the house. That is my view. I get impatient about it from time to time, to be honest. I hear what the Deputy is saying. If you give an upfront grant, there is no guarantee it will be spent on voids, and that is the problem.  I do not have the details of the 40-turnkey units to which Deputy Heneghan referred. Are they in Dún Laoghaire? \n Deputy Barry Heneghan  Yes. \n The Taoiseach  Has the Deputy moved across? \n Deputy Barry Heneghan  I am national now. \n The Taoiseach  The Deputy has a wide compass. He is national now. I ask him to give me the details and I will follow through. It should not happen. I do not know the background to that.  I appreciate the Deputy's comments about the Jewish community in Ireland and the impact that what happened in Bondi Beach has had on the Jewish community globally and in Ireland. The murder that took place was quite shocking. Others were injured. The Deputy also referenced the Complex.  Deputy O'Rourke spoke about child homelessness. The meeting of the Cabinet subcommittee on housing yesterday was entirely about different aspects of homelessness. We had good presentation of data. The data illustrates that there is a wide variety of reason why people become homeless. There are different factors. There is a high rate for singles in homelessness as well as children. There are different elements to the issue. An increasing amount of those who leave direct provision end up homeless. Family reunification comes with that. The link between migration and housing has grown, but is not the only factor. Family separation is a factor. Different factors give rise to homelessness, and specifically child homelessness. The Minister has specific measures. He achieved €100 million in the budget to acquire social housing and housing more generally to take more families out of emergency accommodation and get them into either local authority houses or acquired homes. There is a specific programme ahead now.  Have I dealt with everyone? I have not. \n An Ceann Comhairle  Deputies Ó Murchú and Tóibín. \n The Taoiseach  How could I forget Deputy Ó Murchú? He spoke about estate management powers to deal with what he described as \"chaotic tenants\". There are powers. I am not sure that the AHBs have different powers. They just have a different way of operating. \n Deputy Ruairí Ó Murchú  It is about eviction. \n The Taoiseach  They have a different of operating. They lay it down from the beginning. \n Deputy Ruairí Ó Murchú  It is easier for them to evict people. \n The Taoiseach  Local authorities have struggled with this for quite a long time. My own belief is that persistent misbehaviour and so on should mean you lose the tenancy. That is what should happen. It is hard. We know of housing estates that have awful tensions, difficulties and challenges. I would be glad to work with the Deputy on the issue. I will talk to the Minister about it.  Deputy Quaide spoke about the thousands of houses that have been left lying idle. We give responsibilities to the local authorities. Deputy Connolly talked about league tables. There is a league table showing which local authorities did what in respect of derelict sites. It is very telling. There are two or three that did an exceptional job. If they can do it, why cannot others? It begs the question of whether there is, or has been historically, inertia in local authorities about the Derelict Sites Act. Revenue will now be charged with it. That will bring about a change and better behaviour. The reason for the length of time, and I hope it can be accelerated, is the mapping. I have challenged officials from the Department of Finance and Revenue about this issue. I have asked why the maps are not there already and why they would take so long. Apparently, at the time of the land tax and others, the mapping was not as comprehensive as people would have expected.  That is the issue there. I think it is a game-changer and will be a game-changer.  Deputy Tóibín is making a link between falling fertility and the housing issue. Again, there are a number of variables, I imagine, responsible for that. The bottom line is we do need to provide more housing more quickly to as many young people as possible. It is a social need. Every young person in the country has a right to aspire to owning a home, and many do aspire to owning a home, or some young families being able to rent a home at an affordable cost. We are building substantially more houses than we did five years ago. We are doing about 30,000 odd now compared to 20,000 in 2020. We need to go to 50,000 and we need all hands on deck in that respect. I do not think enrolments are going down in schools yet, I think they are going up. \n Deputy Peadar Tóibín  They are; 30 schools are falling this year. And childcare. ",

        "answerText": " The Taoiseach  I propose to take Questions Nos. 16 to 24, inclusive, together.  I attended the leaders’ summit at COP30 in Belém, Brazil, on 6 and 7 November. Coming a decade after the Paris Agreement and during a period of enhanced geopolitical turbulence, my attendance at the summit was an important opportunity to show Ireland’s continuing commitment to the objectives of the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change and the Paris Agreement to limit emissions in order to avoid the worst impacts of climate change. I delivered Ireland’s national statement on 6 November, highlighting the reality that climate change is no longer a distant threat and pointing to the remarkable litany of record-breaking climate events in the 12 months since COP29 in Azerbaijan, including Storm Éowyn which brought the strongest wind gusts ever recorded in Ireland and the highest storm surges on the western seaboard. We saw the damage that Storm Bram caused last week to counties all over the country. I also argued that the sharpest impacts of climate change are felt by the world’s most vulnerable people and countries and noted that no country can successfully address the crisis of climate change alone.  I participated in two thematic round tables with my fellow leaders to discuss climate issues of common concern. The first focused on \"Climate and Nature: Forests and Oceans\". I reiterated Ireland’s strong support for the agreement reached at COP15 to protect at least 30% of land and oceans by 2030. The second thematic session took the form of a panel discussion on \"Energy transition and ten years of the Paris Agreement: NDCs and financing\". I expressed Ireland’s commitment to ensuring a just and inclusive energy transition pathway for all nations. I also shared Ireland’s focus on accelerating the delivery of renewable generation. I also participated in a small round table hosted by President Lula da Silva and attended also by the United Nations Secretary General, António Guterres, on climate adaptation and resilience. I spoke of Ireland’s commitment in this area with 80% of our climate finance concentrated on adaptation.  I also attended an event launching the Tropical Forest Forever Fund, hosted by President Lula. This global initiative aims to finance the conservation of tropical forests. I reaffirmed Ireland’s commitment to the preservation and sustainable use of the Amazon rainforest. I announced Ireland’s commitment to provide €15 million over the next three years to the Amazon fund, with the aim of preventing and combating deforestation.  While in Belém, I also took the opportunity to visit the offices of the United Nations High Commission for Refugees, where I met with representatives of some of the refugees they work with, including indigenous people from the Amazon displaced by climate change. To date in 2025, Ireland has provided over €25.5 million in funding to UNHCR. \n Deputy Malcolm Byrne  I welcome the fact that the Taoiseach attended the COP in Brazil as head of Government. It is appropriate that he did so. I welcome his remarks while there. I ask the Taoiseach to consider that Ireland might consider hosting a future COP to raise awareness of the important issues he has outlined.  I do want to express concern that if we are going to reduce our own dependence on fossil fuels and get people out of cars, we have to provide them with a realistic public transport alternative. I am passionate about rail travel but unfortunately the M11 is increasingly becoming a car park every morning. The problem for those travelling along the M11 into the capital, unlike a number of other commuter routes, is that we do not have a realistic rail alternative. We have fewer services, worse rolling stock and more overcrowding than any other rail service. What particularly annoys me is the fact that yesterday, the rail project prioritisation strategy made no commitments whatsoever about improvements for the Rosslare rail line and further looked at abandoning the proposals to develop and reopen the Rosslare to Waterford rail line. If we are to provide a real alternative and reduce our dependence on fossil fuels and car use, there has to be a real public transport alternative. I want assurances that the Department of Transport has not abandoned the rail commuters along the Rosslare rail line. \n Deputy Naoise Ó Cearúil  I note that, following the Taoiseach's attendance at COP in Belém, the EU made a significant decision to permanently stop Russian gas imports and phase out Russian oil. Similar to Deputy Byrne, I wish to highlight the issue of reducing our reliance on fossil fuels in the context of significant investment in public transport, in terms of DART+ West, for example, going to Maynooth and then Kilcock. The prioritisation of DART+ South West was not announced. There is significant traffic and build-up on the N7, M7, N4 and M4, particularly the N7 coming from Naas, Sallins and Celbridge. Indeed, Deputy Shane Moynihan has raised it previously. We need to ensure that these key pieces of infrastructure are prioritised along the commuter line that is causing the greatest amount of traffic. \n Deputy Darren O'Rourke  One of the most effective ways we can reduce emissions is by encouraging people on to public transport. I want to raise the lack of public transport in Bellewstown, County Meath. A 13-year-old boy, James Black, has started a campaign there and has hundreds of petition signatures calling for a public bus services for the village of Bellewstown. Fair play and well done to him for that. He has got an amount of media attention about it. He is very articulate and very clear in what he is trying to achieve.  The connecting Ireland scheme in the Department of Transport is a very good one but it is underfunded and Bellewstown is not included in it. Will the Taoiseach increase funding to the connecting Ireland scheme and will he include Bellewstown, County Meath in it? \n Deputy Liam Quaide  We heard a lot during the last Government about how much more investment went into the National Parks and Wildlife Service but in east Cork and Waterford, the level of under-resourcing has been baffling. In east Cork, we have had no ranger for approximately 12 of the last 15 years. There has been no district conservation officer for 18 months and no regional manager in place for years over east Cork and Waterford. It is difficult to give precise figures for these vacancies, because the Department has been incredibly opaque in response to questions I have submitted on recruitment to the NPWS. In one response, the Minister referred to \"perceived vacancies\", as if we were all imagining those roles being vacant. Also, bizarrely, the Department will not give details of staffing by geographical area for \"operational security reasons\". This is akin to An Garda Síochána not sharing numbers of gardaí employed in a given division. The Department also will not give any information on recruitment campaigns being undertaken. Meanwhile, hedgerows and trees are being trashed with impunity and the whole idea of habitat protection looks more like a bad joke in this country. When are we going to see more transparency from the Department of heritage on staffing of the NPWS? When are we going to see those crucial roles in east Cork and Waterford filled? \n Deputy Peadar Tóibín  Today the Minister of State, Deputy Thomas Byrne, stated that the Mercosur deal held many benefits for the Irish farmers and the wider economy. He said that for Ireland, Mercosur could be a significant beneficiary. This is incredible. It is the Minister of State putting up the white flag of surrender in terms of Mercosur. It comes just a few days after the Government put up the white flag in terms of the Irish fishing industry. Make no mistake about it, the Mercosur trade agreement will damage the livelihoods of hundreds of thousands of farmers in this country. All the fine words about COP mean nothing if we are going to facilitate or allow Mercosur to go through. It beggars belief that at a time of climate crisis, we will be bringing in Brazilian beef, which is produced in an environmentally unfriendly way, by which forests are burnt down and land is overgrazed, not to mention the environmental cost of transporting all that beef from South America to Europe. Will the Government stop speaking from both sides of its mouth in terms of Mercosur? \n Deputy Ruairí Ó Murchú  It is difficult to believe that we are talking about rail services being cancelled. These are proposed new services that make complete sense because we want people to move to public transport. We know the advantages that exist in that regard. One of the new rail services that was being proposed between Clongriffin and Drogheda has been mothballed. This would have allowed for further express services to Dundalk, Drogheda, Newry and Belfast. Such services are absolutely necessary because they are allowed to skip slower services. What is happening does not make any sense at this point. Will the Taoiseach seek some clarity in respect of this matter? I other colleagues in expressing absolute anger if this is the road we are going to take. No pun intended. \n The Taoiseach  I thank Deputy Byrne for acknowledging that it was important to attend the COP, even though it was a long distance to go. We needed to send a signal given that we are at a point at which the issue of climate change is receding in terms of political prioritisation. This is a real concern. Some people are pulling back from their commitments.  On hosting a future COP in Ireland, next autumn we will have the largest ever political meeting held in Ireland. There will be over 40 states represented. It is a ginormous undertaking to host a COP, but it is something the country should aspire to do in the future. It depends on the shape and nature of a COP. In some ways it has become very big. Maybe it is has gone too far in some respects in the context of how it has evolved. We need to get back to the more fundamental origin and idea around COP, which was countries coming together to make decisions on global agreements in respect of sustainability, the future of the planet and the impact of climate change.  I will look at the matter of rail project prioritisation. I take on board what the Deputy said. We have a lot of projects that are needed. We do not have commensurate capital, but I will have a look at where the Rosslare railway line is. We put a lot of money into Rosslare on the custom side and all of that in the context of Brexit. We did it in double-quick time. Rosslare to Waterford is an important link. I will have a look at that to see what we can do and where we are. \n Deputy Malcolm Byrne  There is nothing on the roster----- \n An Ceann Comhairle  This is not a back-and-forth. \n The Taoiseach  I said I am going to have a look at it. The Deputy asked me to have a look at it, so I am telling him that I am going to have a look at it.  Deputy Ó Cearúil is correct on the moves we made in terms of dependency on Russian oil and gas. On public transport, it is key. I have spoken to the Ministers for public expenditure and Transport in respect of DART+ South West. That has gone through all the planning and is shovel ready. The county council has zonings for between 10,000 to 18,000 houses. It feels that this is essential infrastructure. I am seeing if we can do something to make that we progress the project. That is work I am engaged in at the moment with the relevant Ministers.  Deputy O'Rourke referred to public transport more generally and to a young person named James Black. I pay tribute to him for his civic initiative, participation and being involved in something like that in terms of public service for Bellewstown. I will talk to the Minister and make him aware of that. On Connecting Ireland, I take on board the Deputy's views.  Deputy Quaide referred to the National Parks and Wildlife Service, NPWS. There has been huge investment in recruitment. The investment in the NPWS has more or less doubled since 2020. I took a personal interest in this. I worked previous with the then Minister, Malcolm Noonan, on it and continue to work on it with the Minister of State, Deputy Christopher O'Sullivan. Recently, we announced a €700,000 lifeline for Fota Wildlife Park through the NPWS because of the understanding work that Fota does in respect of conservation of particular species and so forth. I will engage with NPWS in respect of the issues the Deputy has raised to see if we can throw some light on the situation.  Deputy Tóibín referred to Mercosur. There was no agreement on that. It was not put to COREPER last Friday. I do not have the up-to-date information, but it seems unlikely now that it will put before COREPER before Christmas. What we have undertaken to do is work with like-minded countries, particularly France and Italy----- \n Deputy Peadar Tóibín  What is our position? \n The Taoiseach  -----in terms of securing additional safeguards. Quite a significant number of safeguards have been secured. That is contrary to what was there a year ago. They are taking the form of legal instruments that the Commission has committed to.  We succeeded in securing the nitrates derogation. It is a significant advancement that we now have that for a further three years. It was challenging and difficult. We worked hard with the Commission to get it over the line. Approximately 200,000 tonnes of Mercosur beef come into Europe on an annual basis as it stands. The new initiative under Mercosur would allow 99,000 of those to be brought in under a reduced tariff preference. The Minister of State, Deputy Thomas Byrne, spoke about the wider issues around Mercosur. All trade agreements bring benefits and losses. There is no any heresy in saying that. The Canada deal was tremendous for Ireland in terms of the increased exports for SMEs and so on. I accept that every agreement is different. At the moment, there is no sense of any breakthrough or agreement in respect of Mercosur. That is where we are at present.  Deputy Ó Murchú referred to the Clongriffin to Drogheda service. Capital is not limitlessness. \n Deputy Ruairí Ó Murchú  I get that. I was just wondering. \n The Taoiseach  If we were to add up the figures from everybody's contributions, I would guess that we would arrive at another €50 billion. We have to try keep things moving with planning in the context of progressing as many projects as we possibly can and to make sure that we have sustainability, financing and all of that. I will have to look at the rail prioritisation strategy that emerged on Friday. \n An Ceann Comhairle  I thank the Taoiseach. ",

        "answerText": " Minister of State at the Department of Education and Youth  I propose to take Questions Nos. 517 and 518 together.  The Assessment of Need (AON) process is provided for under the Disability Act 2005 and is under the remit of the Health Service Executive (HSE).  It is important to note that children and young people in mainstream schools do not require an AON or a diagnosis of disability to access mainstream supports from the 15,000 special education teachers in our school system. The Department has removed the need for health-related information to support special education teaching allocation (SET), to transition from a primary to post primary special class, for assistive technology supports and/or for additional SNA requirements.  There has been a very significant growth in demand for special school and special class places in recent years. This has seen an unprecedented rise in the number of children and young people enrolled in special classes and the opening of 16 new special schools.  There is evidence that, in areas where disability services are unable to meet the full range of needs of children and young people, such as for early intervention, therapy supports and/or respite, many families are choosing to apply to all local services, regardless of whether this is the appropriate route for provision for their child. In these circumstances, provision of education services is viewed by some, as being a driver for the AON process with families seeking an AON to secure a diagnosis, which is currently required to access a special school/class placement.  Additionally, while a diagnosis is currently required to access a special class or a special school, this does not have to be linked to an AON.  The Department of Education and Youth will bring forward a proposal through a Memorandum for Government early in 2026 to agree a process which is intended to result in the removal of the requirement for professional reports, such as Assessment of Need reports, from entry requirements for special schools and special classes and the adoption of a needs-based approach, subject to the availability of necessary resources.  There will be a comprehensive consultation process with the full range of education stakeholders and advocacy groups in respect of this proposed measure.  The AON process as it applies to schools and as outlined in DEY Circular 0069/2025 will remain in place. For clarity, there is no change to the AON process as it applies in schools. ",

It is important to note that children and young people in mainstream schools do not require an AON or a diagnosis of disability to access mainstream supports from the 15,000 special education teachers in our school system. The Department has removed the need for health-related information to support special education teaching allocation (SET), to transition from a primary to post primary special class, for assistive technology supports and/or for additional SNA requirements.  There has been a very significant growth in demand for special school and special class places in recent years. This has seen an unprecedented rise in the number of children and young people enrolled in special classes and the opening of 16 new special schools.  There is evidence that, in areas where disability services are unable to meet the full range of needs of children and young people, such as for early intervention, therapy supports and/or respite, many families are choosing to apply to all local services, regardless of whether this is the appropriate route for provision for their child. In these circumstances, provision of education services is viewed by some, as being a driver for the AON process with families seeking an AON to secure a diagnosis, which is currently required to access a special school/class placement.  Additionally, while a diagnosis is currently required to access a special class or a special school, this does not have to be linked to an AON.  The Department of Education and Youth will bring forward a proposal through a Memorandum for Government early in 2026 to agree a process which is intended to result in the removal of the requirement for professional reports, such as Assessment of Need reports, from entry requirements for special schools and special classes and the adoption of a needs-based approach, subject to the availability of necessary resources.  There will be a comprehensive consultation process with the full range of education stakeholders and advocacy groups in respect of this proposed measure.  The AON process as it applies to schools and as outlined in DEY Circular 0069/2025 will remain in place. For clarity, there is no change to the AON process as it applies in schools. ",

        "answerText": " Minister for Children, Disability and Equality  I propose to take Questions Nos. 865 and 866 together.  Under the Disability Act, an Assessment of Need is an assessment process carried out by the HSE where a person is of the opinion that he/she may have a disability, for anyone born on/after 1st June 2002. It first establishes whether the person has a disability (as defined within the Act). It then identifies the health and education needs of the person with a disability and the services required to meet those needs.  On December 9th, Government announced a series of reforms to the Assessment of Need (AON) process which will make the process more effective and efficient for children and families. These reforms include changes to Part 2 of the Disability Act, 2005, which provides for Assessments of Need. The General Scheme of the Disability (Amendment) Bill 2025 was approved by Government on 9 December and will be published on the Department’s website shortly.  These changes will not remove any rights for parents to apply for an Assessment of Need for their child, nor will they alter the statutory six-month timeline set out in the Disability Act.  The Department is currently at an early stage of the legislative process. It is expected that the General Scheme will undergo pre-legislative scrutiny by the Oireachtas Committee on Disability Matters early in the New Year. As the Deputy is aware, the Committee may invite stakeholders to participate and produce a report with recommendations to the Bill based on its scrutiny.  In tandem with this, officials in the Department will be conducting stakeholder engagement sessions with a range of groups, the first of which is scheduled to take place this week. This will build on previous engagement by the Department with the Department of Education and Youth, the National Council for Special Education, the HSE and the National Clinical Programme for People with Disability.  It is also important to note that the work on the proposed changes to Part 2 of the Disability Act was informed by inputs from stakeholders during the development of the National Human Rights Strategy for Disabled People and by the review of the Interim Guidance for the HSE Assessment of Need Standard Operating Procedure, undertaken by the National Clinical Programme for People with Disability (NCPPD). The latter was supported by a multistakeholder Task Group who contributed to the evidence base for changes.  Section 8 of the Disability Act, 2005 makes provision for the carrying out of Assessments of Need, including the appointment of assessment officers by the HSE. They are responsible for carrying out assessments of applicants for assessments of need or for arranging for them to be carried out by other persons with appropriate experience. Notwithstanding this, the HSE assessment officers are solely responsible for the production of the assessment report as set out in Section 8(7) of the Act. This will remain unchanged under the proposed reforms to the AON system.  As part of the reforms to the Assessment of Need process, additional supports will be provided for the assessment officers including:  • The development of new statutory guidelines to ensure that Assessments of Need focus on identifying a child’s needs, engaging in more intensive assessments only where required to identify those needs.  • The establishment by the HSE of eleven new teams, initially, to support HSE assessment processes, including Assessments of Need. Each team will include a psychologist, a speech and language therapist, an occupational therapist, and an administrator, providing clinical guidance where required throughout the process.  • A continued focus by the HSE on the training and development of assessment officers.  The Department is also working with the HSE to identify further opportunities to enhance processes and increase administrative supports for HSE assessment officers.  The provision of an effective and efficient Assessment of Need system continues to be a priority for the Government. ",

        "answerText": " Minister for Education and Youth  I am pleased to announce that, arising from Budget 2026, an additional €8 million in current and capital funding has been allocated to support the sustainability and development of youth services. This investment strengthens the foundation for inclusive, high-quality provision — ensuring continuity, expanding reach, and enabling services to respond to the evolving needs of Ireland’s diverse youth population.  The department remains committed to supporting youth work at both national and local levels, and recognises the importance of inclusive, community-based engagement in supporting the mental-health and wellbeing needs of young people across the country. The increased funding will enable both universal and targeted youth services to continue delivering tailored supports and safe, welcoming spaces for young people across the country.  While the policy responsibility for youth mental health rests with the Minister for Health, the youth sector plays a significant role in fostering wellbeing and resilience. In this context, the department’s largest targeted youth funding scheme, UBU Your Place Your Space - which received an allocation of over €51 million in 2025 - supports young people in a preventative and developmental way. UBU provides safe spaces, builds trusted relationships, and funds services that help disadvantaged and marginalised young people address challenges such as social isolation, while strengthening their overall wellbeing.  In Budget 2025, an additional €1.2 million was allocated for the establishment of ten new UBU services which will provide targeted youth worker-led support for up to 1,000 young people where they are most needed. Each ETB was invited to make a submission for one new UBU service in their area and following a competitive assessment process, the ten locations that secured funding for a new UBU service were as follows:  • Castlepollard, Co. Westmeath  • Laois Rural – UBU Laois Connect (including Mountmellick/Dangans/ Mountrath and Rathdowney), Co. Laois  • East Donegal/South Central Donegal (including Lifford, Stranorlar, Raphoe, Ballindrait, Castlefinn, Killygordon), Co. Donegal  • Carrick on Súir, Co Tipperary  • Johnstown and Urlingford (North Kilkenny), Co. Kilkenny  • Monaghan Town, Co Monaghan  • Deeside Region, Co. Louth/Co. Meath  • Castlebar and Ballinrobe, Co. Mayo  • Greater Kenmare, Co. Kerry  • Newbridge, Co. Kildare  Opportunities for Youth: National Strategy for Youth Work and Related Services is the strategic framework for the youth work sector and was published in September 2024. The purpose of the strategy is to provide a platform for an effective, data-driven, and joined-up approach to the delivery of youth work and related services. In relation to supports being prioritised for mental health, Action 4 of the strategy commits to ensuring that schemes and services include a focus on a number of key policy themes for the next two years, one of which is promoting mental and social well-being among young people.  As part of Opportunities for Youth, Action 9 commits to mapping the availability and distribution of youth work and wider youth services across Ireland, charted against key demographic data. The department is undertaking a comprehensive exercise to capture the provision of youth spaces nationwide, encompassing both youth worker-led and volunteer-led services. Significant progress has already been made through the development of a mapping tool, with the first phase producing an internal dashboard that provides a structured overview of services by location and type. Work is now beginning on the external map, which will be accessible to young people, parents, guardians, and teachers. This initiative will inform future investment decisions, guide service expansion, and enhance accessibility by identifying geographic and thematic gaps in provision.  The department also supports 21 youth information centres (YICs) nationally. These centres provide young people with a trusted source of information on rights, opportunities, health, wellbeing, welfare and other matters, and are a means by which they can find their way to more specialised help when they need it. In 2025, the department allocated over €1.5 million in funding for YICs. One of the organisations in receipt of this funding is Spunout, Ireland’s national youth information website, which provides youth information online including on such matters as mental and sexual health, employment and training. Spunout also hosts an online youth information chat service. Spunout also receives additional grant funding from the department under the Youth Services Grant Scheme.  Funding is provided to Foróige to support the Big Brother Big Sister Programme which is an internationally renowned youth mentoring programme that forms friendships between an adult volunteer and a young person who would benefit from extra support. They also aim to involve vulnerable young people in mentoring programmes to support their active and conscious development. Foróige’s allocation for Big Brother Big Sister in 2025 was €1,213,000.  Furthermore, the department provides funding to the National Youth Council of Ireland (NYCI) to support its national youth health programme. This programme seeks to build capacity within the youth work sector to support young people's health and wellbeing. €86,952 has been allocated to this programme by the department in 2025.  The Budget documentation published sets out funding for key measures and actions?agreed for the coming year. As the Deputy may be aware, in line with standard practice,?the final allocation of funding for the department for 2026 will be set out in the 2026 Revised Estimates Volume (REV) which is?due to be published later this year. Further details on the 2026 allocations for the department will be available after the 2026 REV process is complete. ",

        "answerText": " Minister for Education and Youth  Maynooth University is now offering a new three-year Professional Doctorate programme in Educational Psychology. Launched in September 2025 with an intake of twenty Trainee Educational Psychologists in Year 1, this programme will support a substantial increase in the number of qualified educational psychologists available to the Department of Education and Youth’s National Educational Psychological Service (NEPS). It marks a significant step forward on the Government’s commitment to double the number of college places for educational psychologists as outlined in the Programme for Government 2025.  Over the three-year programme, trainees will develop expertise in the core skills of assessment, intervention, consultation, training and research within a variety of educational and service settings. They will gain hands-on experience working with children, young people, families and professionals, ensuring they are well-prepared to support the learning, development, and emotional wellbeing of children and young people.  The Maynooth University programme will be compliant with the Standards of Proficiency and Criteria for Education and Training Programmes for Educational Psychologists recently published by CORU, Ireland’s multi-profession health and social care regulator. Practice placements as part of this programme will ensure that the graduate Educational Psychologists will have achieved all the Standards of Proficiency upon successful completion of an education and training programme.  The two other professional doctorate training programmes for educational psychologists in Ireland provided by UCD and MIC will also now be required to comply with the new Standards of Proficiency and Criteria for Education and Training programmes for educational psychologists as set out by CORU. Previously these programmes were regulated by the Psychological Society of Ireland.  The graduates of the Maynooth University Educational Psychology programme will be qualified to register with CORU as Educational Psychologists. The HSE employment criteria for HSE services is a matter for the Department of Health. The Maynooth University students are in receipt of a bursary from the Department of Education and Youth, and as such have committed to working in NEPS for three years post-graduation. The bursary scheme will enable an increase in the supply of educational psychologists available to NEPS, and thus, will help to ensure the ongoing delivery of a high-quality educational psychology service to children, young people and their teachers in school communities across Ireland.  This commitment is part of the broader, long-term commitment by Government to radically reshape and significantly enhance the provision of therapy services and educational psychology services for children and young people in schools.

Planning permission has been granted for a further 14,908 beds, with nearly 2,500 of these in Cork. The Rent-a-Room Scheme continues to play an important role in the overall student housing landscape. All higher education institutions maintain online databases or private accommodation lists. Currently, there are over 5,200 beds being advertised with approximately 1,300 beds advertised across Cork.  I will be publishing the National Student Accommodation Strategy in the coming weeks. This Strategy aims to support the viability of PBSA projects and increase the supply of student accommodation for full-time undergraduate and postgraduate students attending publicly funded Higher Education Institutions. It will address affordability separately by providing for targeted financial supports for those students who need it the most.  The Higher Education Authority is progressing the Technological Sector Student Accommodation Programme, which aims to assess proposals from the Sector for projects located on or near each of the main campus locations. Stage 1 of this programme involved the submission of strategic assessment documents, exploring a range of delivery models.  The second phase will focus on developing and evaluating preliminary business cases, which are due in 2026. The programme follows the Infrastructure Guidelines Process to ensure all projects are rigorously assessed for strategic fit, feasibility, and alignment with national policy objectives.  My Department will work in partnership with the entire sector to advance and implement accommodation initiatives as part of the forthcoming strategy. ",

        "answerText": " The Taoiseach  I propose to take Questions Nos. 1 to 12 together.  The UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer and I both attended the recent G20 Summit in South Africa. We had a number of conversations in the margins of meetings there, including on the situation in Ukraine, on which an informal meeting of the coalition of the willing took place. Previously, I met with Prime Minister Starmer at Chequers on 12 September. We discussed a broad range of matters, including the positive state of bilateral relations between Ireland and the UK. We also discussed the legacy framework - this was one of the reasons I went to Chequers - which was published subsequently on 19 September. The Prime Minister and I took note of progress on the UK-Ireland 2030 programme of strategic co-operation since the summit on 6 March on implementation across each of the programme’s four pillars of security, justice and global issues; climate, energy and innovation; growth, trade and investment; and culture, education and people-to-people links. We looked ahead to the second UK-Ireland summit, which Ireland will host in the spring of 2026. This work complements that undertaken under the British-Irish Council, which will meet in Wales later this week, and the British-Irish Intergovernmental Conference, which took place in Dublin on 17 November.  The Prime Minister and I also discussed a range of international issues, including the catastrophic situation in Gaza. We agreed in particular on the then urgent need for a ceasefire, the release of hostages and the delivery of humanitarian aid at scale, as well as finding a pathway to a two-state solution for a lasting peace. We committed to continue to work together with the coalition of the willing to strengthen support for Ukraine and increase pressure on Russia to stop its war of aggression on the people of Ukraine.  Deputies may wish to be aware that the First Minister of Scotland, John Swinney, was in Ireland last week to mark the agreement of a new bilateral co-operation framework between Ireland and Scotland. The new framework includes six broad areas for future co-operation, including in the context of a strengthened Ireland-UK relationship. I also met with First Minister Swinney in Government Buildings during his visit. \n Deputy Brendan Smith  I have had numerous opportunities in this House to welcome in general terms the legacy framework that was agreed between the British and Irish Governments and published in early September. There is an urgent need to enact legislation to give effect to the provisions outlined in the framework. Did the Taoiseach detect an urgency or a very strong commitment from the UK Prime Minister on the need to get this issue dealt with? Many families have waited for justice for decades and decades. We have to move on and get progress on the rights, the concerns and the grief that engulfs so many families of victims for many decades now. At the end of this month, we will mark the 53rd anniversary of the Belturbet bombing, which cost the lives of two young teenagers. We also have had significant dates in relation to commemorations, for example marking the terrible atrocities in Monaghan and Dublin in May 1974. There are so many atrocities for which nobody has been brought to justice. We cannot ever attach enough urgency to trying to deal, once and for all, with legacy issues. \n Deputy Ruth Coppinger  The right to protest against the genocide in Palestine is being severely undermined the UK and this is being carried through to the North as well. I want to raise a case with the Taoiseach that he could raise with the Prime Minister. This is the case of Saoirse Wagner, a student at Queen's University in Belfast, who is being threatened with expulsion for taking part in a peaceful, calm and non-threatening protest on the issue of Palestine. The Palestine assembly in the college protested at the careers fair to highlight companies that are participating in the genocide. I think the Taoiseach will agree with me that taking part in student protest is a fundamental right and so important in our democracy. To threaten a student with their whole third level education being completely taken away for participating in a peaceful protest is something we should take a stand against. I ask the Taoiseach to make representations to the college. Saoirse is known to me. I know that she would not participate in anything violent. I ask the Taoiseach to take this case on board. \n Deputy Ruairí Ó Murchú  We are coming up to the 50th anniversary of the Dundalk bombing, which happened on 19 December 1975. Dundalk lost Hugh Watters, who was a local tailor and a well-respected man, and Jack Rooney, a fireman and a man who worked for the council. Obviously, this was devastating for their families. A memorial event has been organised by the families. It is going to happen near the courthouse, where there is a plaque, at 6.15 p.m. on Friday, 19 December. I think it is very important that we commemorate this 50th anniversary. It was the same night as the attack on Donnelly's Bar in Silverbridge where three people were killed. This was carried out by the Glenanne gang. We know this was a UVF gang which had members of the UDR and the RUC within it and obviously, the British state was up to its neck in relation to it. I would ask about the engagement around producing a framework that will actually deliver for families like these that have been failed and that Britain does not walk away from its role and its dirty war that it fought in Ireland. \n Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett  The Taoiseach said he discussed Gaza and Palestine with Keir Starmer. A standard tactic of the Israeli state has been to say that anybody who criticises Israel for genocide, apartheid, ethnic cleansing or the persecution of Palestinians, is somehow antisemitic. Keir Starmer, of course, has a record of going along with that nonsense and attacking people like Jeremy Corbyn, who is one of the most long-standing anti-racists and an absolute opponent of antisemitism. It is an outrageous accusation. We have now seen an instance of our own ambassador being dressed down by an Israeli minister, who accused the Irish people and the Irish Government of antisemitism. I would like to know what the Taoiseach thinks about that. Is he capitulating to that bullying by the Israeli state by intervening on the proposal to rename Herzog Park? This is an entirely justified proposal, given Chaim Herzog's history of involvement in ethnic cleansing of Palestinians. \n Deputy Peadar Tóibín  A series health crisis is arising in the North of Ireland at the moment. Sinn Féin, the DUP, the UUP and the Alliance Party are closing down key hospital services in Daisy Hill Hospital, Enniskillen and Causeway Hospital in Derry. These closures are having a significant effect on services. Patients in Craigavon hospital are waiting for 19 hours to see their emergency doctor. The waiting time at the emergency department in the Royal Victoria Hospital is nine hours.  One day, there were 40 ambulances stuck at hospitals trying to deliver their patients. The longest waiting time was 13 hours. I pay tribute to the SOS Causeway Hospital campaign and Gemma Brolly, who is involved in that.  The boss of the British Medical Association in the North stated that an all-Ireland GP service would be a way to help resolve these crises. Daisy Hill, Enniskillen and Causeway all have hinterlands that feed into the South of Ireland in areas where there is great need for hospital services too. Is the Taoiseach speaking to the British Prime Minister about developing an all-Ireland health service? \n Deputy Liam Quaide  When I asked the Taoiseach about flood relief for east Cork villages last week, he accused me of being sly in how I had raised the question. That adjective could be more fairly levelled at his British counterpart, Keir Starmer, who built his political career on the basis of being a human rights lawyer and unifier of the left. In power, he has enthusiastically supported the imprisonment of people for years who protest against climate inaction, along with the designation of protesters of genocide as terrorists. I fully appreciate that the UK makes its own political decisions and that we have to maintain good relations with political leaders with whom we often might have major disagreements, but it is also true that Irish citizens are affected by Starmer’s authoritarian crackdown on peaceful protests. Acclaimed novelist Sally Rooney has been prevented from collecting a prestigious Sky Arts award in person due to fears of arrest for her support of Palestine Action. Great-grandmother Máire Ní Mhurchú, originally from Douglas in Cork, was arrested in London in September, along with her sisters Gráinne and Olga, for a peaceful protest against genocide. When the Taoiseach met Keir Starmer, did he raise with him his government's aggressive and authoritarian approach to peaceful protest and its impact on Irish as well as British citizens? \n Deputy Shane Moynihan  With reference to the Taoiseach’s meeting with British Prime Minister, Keir Starmer, I note the progress made by the UK Government with regard to dealing with legacy, and I compliment Deputy Smith on his work in this area in particular.  I note the publication this week by the House of Commons Northern Ireland Affairs Committee around legacy. One of the more interesting recommendations was that Ireland needs to do more with regard to legacy. I would love to hear the Taoiseach's thoughts on that given that all of the legacy investigations of this country have been ECHR compliant, which is not necessarily something that can be said in the case of the UK.  I call for increased and accelerated action on, in particular, the Dublin and Monaghan bombings. That has been raised many times in this House and it needs to fall under the ambit of the legacy issues as well.  What engagement has the Taoiseach had with the Prime Minister on the ongoing humanitarian disaster of a crisis in Sudan, somewhere the international community needs to step up and pay attention? I wish to hear his thoughts on their engagement on that matter. \n Deputy Rose Conway-Walsh  There can be no watering-down of the commitments made in the British and Irish Governments' joined legacy framework. There are parts of that framework I question but it is very important. I welcome the Northern Ireland Affairs Committee report on this legacy legislation. The primary legislation underpinning the political framework is moving through Westminster. The bottom line is that the legislation must command the confidence of the families and be human rights compliant in order for it to properly deal with the legacy of the past. Reports that the legislation, which is already weak in parts, could be watered down are extremely concerning and will not be accepted. It is deeply concerning that any legislation would provide the British Secretary of State with the power to veto disclosure on national security grounds for family reports from the information retrieval body, the ICIR and the new legacy commission. All families and survivors have the right to have an Article 2-compliant investigation into the deaths of their loved ones. \n Deputy Paul Murphy  A new defence co-operation agreement with Britain is to be signed soon. Members of the House of Lords are saying it will mean a stronger defence relationship between Ireland and the UK. The Taoiseach himself has said there must be very close co-operation with the British when it comes to security. Does he really think that is what Irish people want? Has he forgotten that our neutrality originates from an anti-imperialist struggle against Britain, a struggle Fianna Fáll once fought for? Can he tell us what will be in this new military agreement? Britain is increasing its military expenditure by £67.7 billion. It is an active participant in the genocide in Gaza. Are we going to be expected to massively increase our military expenditure, too, as part of this new agreement? \n The Taoiseach  I thank all of the Deputies for raising a range of issues. Deputy Smith was the first to raise the issue of legacy. I believe there is a sincere commitment on behalf of the British Government as to the implementation of the legacy framework. That is shared by Prime Minister Starmer and, indeed, Secretary of State Hilary Benn, who has acted honourably in all of the negotiations and discussions in respect of the legacy framework. I visited Chequers last September specifically on legacy, along with other issues. It was important to meet with Keir Starmer on that. He has experience of the North from a former role there.  I know the Deputy has been a strong advocate on Belturbet and Monaghan and Dublin. From our perspective, it is important that the Denton report may shed some light on the Monaghan bombing and related issues Deputy Ó Murchú raised. This is relevant also to the activities of the Glennane gang and we eagerly await its publication. Operation Kenova was quite good, in my view, particularly in terms of the victims, who were very impressed with Jon Boutcher when he was in charge of Kenova. They articulated to me that he was one of the first people they met who understood where the families of the victims are coming from.  Deputy Moynihan also raised legacy. We have responsibilities in our jurisdiction. If assertions are made about us, we need to robustly deal with them, but the most effective way to do it is to make sure we respond properly to legacy. As part of the framework agreement, the British Government has, with speed, produced its legislation. That demonstrates the seriousness with which it is approaching this essential work. We are also producing legislation once the UK legislation is enacted. The Minister, Deputy O'Callaghan, has said he is hopeful the general scheme of the Bill will be published in April or May of next year. Enabling reciprocal co-operation between the two jurisdictions is at the heart of the agreed joint framework on legacy.  Additionally, as part of the joint framework agreement, the Garda Commissioner has agreed to the establishment by the end of this year of a dedicated unit as a central point of contact in relation to Troubles-related investigations undertaken by An Garda Síochána. That is an important step forward. Unionist communities in the North have always had a view. We did the Smithwick tribunal and we dealt with it quickly as part of the commitment of earlier agreements, but we do also have to be upfront in terms of the legacy framework and respond properly and comprehensively in relation to that.  I say to Deputy Ó Murchú and all those concerned about legacy that it is not about British state violence alone. It is about that, but it is also about the role of the paramilitaries, such as the Provisional IRA. I have met families of victims who have had no closure at all in terms of atrocities committed by the Provisional IRA or the Ulster loyalist groups. The focus has to be broad-based. There is an opportunity in this legacy framework to give closure to families once and for all, after decades of a lack of closure.  Deputy Coppinger raised the issue of Saoirse Wagner and asked me to talk to the Queen's University authorities. The right to protest is sacrosanct. A number of Deputies have raised this issue. Sometimes protests impede other people from doing their normal work, which is a problem. People are entitled to protest. When the war in Gaza started, I was addressing a group of 100 law students, but the objective of a protest was to stop me and to interfere with the exercise and engagement with about 100 law students. People were shouting internally, security asked them to leave and eventually they did. I was in no doubt that the whole purpose was that I would not have that engagement. Where is the balance of rights there in terms of my freedom to speak as a public representative or the freedom of people in the community to hear me? A lot of protests have crossed the line, in my opinion, with a view to stopping things happening. During a consultative forum on security challenges that I hosted as Minister for foreign affairs two years ago, the protests at that were not about protests. They were deliberately calculated to disrupt the event. \n Deputy Paul Murphy  The forum was not about consultation either, was it? \n The Taoiseach  It was a legitimate consultation. If the Deputy believes in freedom of assembly and freedom of speech, what he and like-minded people were about was stopping that from even happening.  They never complain about that. It is fair play for them to do that. There is balance here. \n Deputy Ruth Coppinger  I do not know about the protest. \n The Taoiseach  Of course the Deputy knows about the protests. She knows all about them. \n Deputy Ruth Coppinger  I have no idea what the Taoiseach is on about. \n The Taoiseach  They were on the public television, for God's sake. \n Deputy Ruth Coppinger  I do not organise every protest in Ireland. \n The Taoiseach  They were on the public television, in the media and everywhere. In this House----- \n Deputy Paul Murphy  That does not make it terrorism. \n The Taoiseach  -----assertions were made. I am not calling it that. \n An Ceann Comhairle  The Deputies are only delaying the next question. \n The Taoiseach  The point I am illustrating is that there are different forms of protest on the continuum and some of those forms are unacceptable----- \n Deputy Ruth Coppinger  We did not organise----- \n An Ceann Comhairle  Deputy, stop engaging, please. \n The Taoiseach  -----as an infringement of the rights of people generally. That is the point I am making. \n An Ceann Comhairle  The time has elapsed. \n Deputy Ruth Coppinger  I am just correcting a mistruth there. \n The Taoiseach  It is not a one-way street----- \n An Ceann Comhairle  It does not matter. \n The Taoiseach  -----all of the time. That is the point I am making. Ramming gates at Shannon Airport is not a legitimate form of protest. Stopping trade through Dublin Port is not a legitimate form of protest----- \n Deputy Ruth Coppinger  We are not. \n The Taoiseach  -----because people's livelihood depends on it. Eighty per cent of trade in this country goes through Dublin Port. Having a problem with a company is not a justification, in my view, for disrupting the entire port. I have no problem having a debate. I participated in protests as a student. I think student protests are important. \n Deputy Ruth Coppinger  Did you? \n An Ceann Comhairle  This is not a debate. \n The Taoiseach  I did, actually \n Deputy Ruth Coppinger  Okay, I will look that one up. \n The Taoiseach  The Deputy can do that. Joe Duffy was put in prison as a result of that protest. It was to do with medical cards. There you are now. Students in this country automatically had medical cards at one time. That was taken away in the eighties. The point is that legitimate protests----- \n Deputy Ruth Coppinger  Which party was that? \n An Ceann Comhairle  Ah please, Deputy, we have to get through this. \n The Taoiseach  I think it was the Deputy's former colleagues in the Labour Party. \n An Ceann Comhairle  Taoiseach, are we moving on? \n The Taoiseach  That is history. Protests happen, and I have no issue with that, but there is a continuum. I will take the Ceann Comhairle's advice.  To Deputy Ó Murchú, I have dealt with some of the legacy issues, which Deputy Conway-Walsh also raised. I will talk to Queen's University on that point. In terms of the Dundalk bombing and the Glennane gang, I hope Operation Denton will shed light on that. \n Deputy Peadar Tóibín  What about the health services? \n The Taoiseach  I will come to that. On Deputy Boyd Barrett's question, there is no relationship between the strategy and policy of the Israeli Government and my views on the renaming of Herzog Park. I have a very basic view. Throughout the history of the State, there have been namings and renamings. I am, and have been, a student of history and I taught students. I always showed them that the names of parks could be the remnants of empire or anything, but they are windows to explain the history of a given subject or personality. If we keep shutting down everything that is named after somebody, there will be no history left. \n Deputy Paul Murphy  When was it named Herzog Park? \n The Taoiseach  There will not be a history left. \n Deputy Paul Murphy  When was it named Herzog Park? It was ten or 20 years ago. \n An Ceann Comhairle  Please move on, Taoiseach. \n The Taoiseach  That is not the point. \n Deputy Paul Murphy  That is not history. \n The Taoiseach  It is, actually, if you go back through his father and before that and examine how Jewish communities came to Ireland in the first instance. There is huge history there, for God's sake. \n Deputy Paul Murphy  But not the park. \n An Ceann Comhairle  Deputy----- \n Deputy Paul Murphy  It is still history if you change the name of the park. \n The Taoiseach  As a historian and someone who is interested in history, I would be very careful. \n An Ceann Comhairle  -----you are verging on disruptive. \n The Taoiseach  Breandán Ó hEithir wrote in Lig Sinn i gCathú about the thirties when places were being shut down left, right and centre. \n An Ceann Comhairle  Seven more Deputies, Taoiseach. \n The Taoiseach  There is a lot more to it than that, but it has nothing to do with this. I can put Deputy Boyd Barrett at ease in that regard. \n An Ceann Comhairle  There are seven more Deputies to answer, Taoiseach. \n The Taoiseach  By the way, I object, like the Deputy does, to Israel's consistent messaging that if you are not onside, you are offside or antisemitic. That is wrong. You are entitled to be against Israeli Government policy and criticise it and not be labelled antisemitic. That is absolutely correct and I support it.  Deputy Tóibín should talk to his former colleagues in Sinn Féin in earnest and engage with them on the health services in Northern Ireland. That is one issue. There are broader problems with the National Health Service generally, but there are real issues in Northern Ireland. There is no question about the pressures on the health service there. \n Deputy Peadar Tóibín  There are benefits to an all-Ireland health service. \n An Ceann Comhairle  Deputy, this is not a continuous back-and-forth. I am not allowing that. This is Taoiseach's Questions. The Deputy has asked a question and is getting an answer. \n The Taoiseach  Under the shared island initiative, we are trying to do specific projects and programmes, for example in paediatric and cardiovascular health, cardiac surgery and the cancer centre at Altnagelvin hospital. Those are good programmes that have worked very well.  Deputy Quaide referred to Prime Minister Starmer. I do not see him as an authoritarian person when I meet him. I spoke about the continuum of protest. I am not au fait with British security services or why they came to do what they did in respect of Palestine Action. We have proceeded differently in this country. When I meet Prime Minister Starmer, I will have an opportunity to deal fundamentally with a range of issues although we cannot deal with every single issue. The UK has had challenges on both sides of the political spectrum in respect of protests and the nature of those protests.  I dealt with the points raised by Deputy Shane Moynihan about Operation Denton. The Sudan issue is one I have raised consistently with leaders, including publicly, at the G20 summit and at the Africa-European Union summit. It is catastrophic. It rarely gets mentioned in this House, but 12 million people have been displaced. Genocide against the civilian population is happening there. Some of the rebel forces are being supported by neighbouring countries with arms and so forth.  To respond to Deputy Conway-Walsh, the framework is Article 2 compliant. It is far stronger than its predecessor as a legacy Bill.  Deputy Murphy raised the new co-operation agreement. It absolutely makes sense that we co-operate very closely with the United Kingdom on the gas connectors, for example. Those are a huge security vulnerability for both the UK and Ireland, but particularly for Ireland. Within a week, our economy would come to a standstill if anything untoward were to happen to those interconnectors. I hope the Deputy would agree that we should have close defence co-operation for our economic security, in particular, and for our subsea cables. That will mean a lot of technological co-operation. When a Russian shadow fleet crosses over those pipes or subsea cables, very often divers have to go down and check that the pipes are okay. That is co-operation. Letting people know that somebody who might be up to not good is in your terrain is co-operation. Intelligence services sharing information about terrorists or potential attacks is co-operation. There should be no big deal about co-operation.  By the way, on the origin of our neutrality, it was not an anti-imperialist origin. In fact, at the consultative forum, there was a very good seminar on our neutrality and its origins. Obviously, the Second World War was at the core. We were neutral in not having issues with Britain and the occupation of Northern Ireland and so on, but the more fundamental issue was that it was a neutrality of survival. No one was in a position to defend Ireland in 1939, 1940 or 1941. There were good presentations made at that consultative forum but Deputy Murphy boycotted it because he felt it was not worthwhile. It would have been informative had he gone. It would have provided a more nuanced view----- \n Deputy Paul Murphy  It is a shame the Taoiseach scrapped the idea of a citizens' assembly. \n The Taoiseach  -----of the origins of our neutrality. \n An Ceann Comhairle  I thank the Taoiseach and ask him to move to the next question. \n The Taoiseach  I apologise. I thank the Ceann Comhairle for her tolerance. \n An Ceann Comhairle  It is not my tolerance. I get complaints at the Business Committee that this forum is not working. We are going to take it to the Dáil reform committee for change. ",

        "answerText": " The Taoiseach  I propose to take Questions Nos. 13 to 23, inclusive, together.  Regulation, and the extent of any regulatory or administrative burden, has recently become a greater focus at European Union level and nationally as a means to further enhance competitiveness. At a European level, both simplification and implementation are important Commission priorities. The Commission is striving to simplify and lighten the administrative burden of European Union regulations to ensure they are proportionate, stable, coherent and technologically neutral.  Likewise, our national regulatory framework is a central focus for the Government as we strive to support competitiveness at a time of international economic uncertainty. In line with the programme for Government, we published an action plan on competitiveness and productivity on 10 September this year. The action plan includes actions across government to ensure the development of a more effective regulatory system which will support economic growth.  These actions reflect priority areas where targeted public policy intervention can have the greatest impact. These include a red-tape challenge to reduce regulation for SMEs; the application of the SME test by Government Departments to all measures, in particular policy initiatives where it is proposed to increase costs on small businesses; expediting the Environmental (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill; commencing reforms, as we have done, under the Planning and Development Act 2024 to enhance delivery of infrastructure; and implementing the outstanding recommendations from the review of the administration of civil justice review group report.  Increased regulatory burden has also been identified as a barrier to infrastructure development and delivery. The Minister, Deputy Chambers, supported by the work of the accelerating infrastructure task force, this morning, with Government colleagues including me, the Tánaiste and the Minister of State, Deputy Harkin, published a plan which will include extensive regulatory reforms aimed at accelerating the delivery of critical infrastructure.  Today's plan provides the blueprint to reduce complexity and blockages in the system and deliver infrastructure with urgency. The changes we are initiating today are vital if we are to maintain our competitive position in an ever uncertain world. They are also necessary to support our citizens with top class public services, job security, access to housing and all other facilities necessary to enjoy the stability and good quality of life we are all entitled to expect.  The actions are ambitious but achievable, and delivering them will require commitment and co-operation across a broad and diverse range of stakeholders, from political, legal and public sectors, industry and society as a whole. We have established a cost-of-business advisory forum where business owners and representative bodies can speak directly to decision-makers about the real-world impact of regulations, fees and operational challenges. The work of that forum is under way. The Minister, Deputy McEntee, is working on the simplification omnibus packages put forward by the European Commission in a range of policy areas, most recently the Commission's digital simplification omnibus package, which was published last month.  My Department will play a co-ordinating role across these different regulatory reform initiatives, as outlined in the action plan on competitiveness and productivity, including the establishment of a central economic regulators' forum, and we will work with the Minister for Enterprise, Tourism and Employment and other Government colleagues on that agenda. \n Deputy Tony McCormack  I thank the Taoiseach for his response. I acknowledge the significant work he, the Minister, Deputy Chambers, and their two Departments are doing on infrastructure reform, particularly the steps being taken to modernise planning, reduce delays and ensure major projects move forward. Infrastructure reform is vital, but businesses and especially SMEs are also calling for a more streamlined regulatory environment. These firms consistently cite overlapping rules, slow approvals and heavy administrative demands as major obstacles to growth. Building on the work already happening on infrastructure, will the Taoiseach update the House on what specific measures his Department is pursuing to simplify compliance for SMEs, reduce unnecessary paperwork and make it easier for businesses to operate and expand? How will these reforms help to lower costs for employers and the taxpayer by making the system more efficient overall? \n Deputy Albert Dolan  It is vital that when we speak about regulatory reform, we talk about the administrative operations of existing systems in the function of the State. I will specifically reflect on the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland, SEAI, and the roll-out of grants. We are about to have a debate in this Chamber on energy costs. One thing that is vital is that the best way the Government can help to reduce energy costs in homes is to retrofit them for the future so that they simply do not need as much energy. That is the number one way to reduce the cost and it facilitates homes to be more efficient and takes pressure off the grid. The Government needs to do something to accelerate the rate at which homes can be retrofitted by the SEAI. For many constituents in my constituency, it is taking too long to get through the process of approval of the grant to construction. \n Deputy Ruairí Ó Murchú  We all accept there are huge issues with bureaucracy and red tape in planning. We should have seen simplification and streamlining. Conversations about this are occurring across Europe, but we know about the home-grown issues. It is an issue I have brought up previously, even within the planning systems involving State authorities. For example, Louth County Council is involved in the Ardee Education Together National School build and a particular issue has arisen. We do not have enough agility in the system. Multiple requests have gone in stating that there are not enough parking spaces. There are 21 spaces, including three disability spaces. There are only two set-down spaces for minibuses and there is a need for five as there are five autism spectrum disorder, ASD, classes and there is not even room for a full-size 52-seater bus to turn. There are 21 spaces for staff and there is a need for something closer to 40. \n An Ceann Comhairle  Thank you, Deputy. \n Deputy Ruairí Ó Murchú  It is possible to get this work done at this time, but if the works continue as planned, the problem will still need to be fixed but it could take more than €100,000, so we need something to be done. \n Deputy Darren O'Rourke  I raise the regulation of social media companies in the online space, particularly as it relates to children. The criticism that has been levelled at Coimisiún na Meán's online safety code is that an earlier draft had a recommendation that social media companies turn off recommender systems and it has been removed. Recommender systems profile people who are using apps and then drive them down often hateful and dangerous rabbit holes. It is not healthy for them or society. Will this be looked at? \n Deputy Ruth Coppinger  I raise regulatory reform of immigration and particularly family reunification. It is now being made much harder for many essential workers to be unified with their families, in particular migrant healthcare assistants who were brought over here on a visa programme and are working in private nursing homes. Last week on RTÉ radio, the Minister for justice was asked by the presenter whether these people are not entitled to a normal family life. They are caring for our older people and we have to show we care for them. The Minister's reply was that no one is forcing them to come here. That is absolutely heartless, shows zero empathy and is also completely counterproductive because many of them are nurses. They could go to other countries, but they have come to Ireland and are working below their grades or qualifications, giving huge added value to the nursing homes. I urge the Taoiseach to have a heart. We had a briefing here a few years ago, which Deputy Michael Healy-Rae attended because he knew the value of those healthcare assistants in nursing homes. These are essential workers and they will go elsewhere. \n An Ceann Comhairle  Thank you, Deputy. \n Deputy Ruth Coppinger  Please entitle them to have a normal family life. These mothers should not be separated from their kids. \n Deputy Paul Murphy  The programme for Government says the Government will move responsibility for the Multi-Unit Developments, MUD, Acts to the Department of housing from the Department of justice and establish a unit in the Housing Agency to regulate owners' management companies, OMCs, to ensure effective governance. That is important work that needs to happen. The problem is that it is not happening currently, but it has been agreed. Effectively what is holding it up is that, as a result of the Mulcreevy judgment, the primary legislation needs to be changed. At the moment, the MUD Act refers to the Minister for justice and not the Minister for housing. A simple amendment is needed to change the reference to the Minister for housing. Until that happens, all this work of regulatory oversight of OMCs and so on is simply not taking place. There was a meeting of the housing committee to discuss these issues. It invited various officials from the Department of housing and was told they could not come yet because their line Minister is not yet responsible for this. \n An Ceann Comhairle  Thank you, Deputy. \n Deputy Paul Murphy  The Housing Agency has not been allocated funding for doing any regulatory work as a result. This needs urgent action. \n Deputy Liam Quaide  There was a health committee session last week on the regulation of counselling and psychotherapy. In standards it has published, CORU has adopted a position that is entirely at odds with the main representative groups of those disciplines, which will reduce supervision requirements and remove mandatory personal therapy for trainees. These changes, if implemented, will degrade professional standards and undermine patient safety. CORU is showing a remarkable level of intransigence on these fundamentals of safe practice. Practitioners and representative bodies have warned that the proposals could also jeopardise recognition and mobility across the EU for counsellors and psychotherapists. We must protect high-quality training, preserve public confidence and ensure regulation strengthens, not weakens, these services.  I am not expressing some fringe opinion. The health committee was unanimous in supporting the counselling and psychotherapy representative groups and the session included some strong and insightful contributions from the Taoiseach's party colleagues, including Senator Costello. Will the Government immediately pause the CORU process, bring representative bodies and practitioners into full consultation and commit to reforms that prioritise client safety and high professional standards? \n Deputy Rose Conway-Walsh  I will talk about the regulation of quarries. The Taoiseach knows the price we have paid in this country and the price that families affected by the defective concrete blocks scandal have paid due to a lack of regulation.  Many of the homeowners I have spoken to in Mayo are not satisfied with the current regulations of quarries and in particular, that geologists are not examining the aggregate within the quarries that are being used to build homes now. I ask the Taoiseach to have a look at this area to see what can be done in that regard. It can be easily fixed by engaging and employing geologists to do the job and to make sure that people have confidence in the materials that are coming out of quarries. \n Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett  The Taxi Regulation Act 2013 clearly gives the Minister the power to impose regulations around the activities of dispatch companies. Today, for the third time in two weeks, taxi drivers in Dublin are protesting. There is a widespread protest against this across the country by taxi drivers over the behaviour of Uber, a multimillion euro company, that is trying to undermine the livelihood of nearly 20,000 taxi drivers by introducing a fixed fare system. This will undermine the regulated fare structure and therefore the livelihoods of taxi drivers and ultimately the industry itself. In the long run, as is clear from Uber's behaviour elsewhere in the world, it will not benefit the customer. Once the company gets hold of a market, fares and charges go up and the livelihoods of taxi drivers get smashed. Will the Taoiseach ask the Minister for Transport to impose such regulations to prevent Uber destroying the industry and livelihoods of taxi drivers around this fixed fare system and enforce the taxi regulation and meter stuff? \n The Taoiseach  Deputy McCormack raised infrastructure reform, particularly for small to medium-sized businesses. Some of the measures we have taken in respect of deferring the alignment of the minimum wage with the national living wage will help to avoid the escalation of costs because the SME sector has borne the brunt of a lot of additional costs over the past five years. There is no doubt the reduction in VAT on hospitality will help a lot of SMEs in the hospitality sector and hairdressing as well. The number of sick days leave is going to be quickly expanded. We have expanded it to three days. The cumulative cost of everything has been fairly excessive. The Small Business Forum is there to try to balance imposition on small business as well as the cost.  The other issue is the sequential approach to planning and regulations as opposed to a concurrent approach whereby instead of waiting for the planning to be done, agencies do the procurement. Instead of waiting for environmental assessments, doing them all in parallel would speed up a lot of activity. In many instances, we are constantly looking at the avoidance of increased cost for SMEs and trying to slow down the increased costs that have come their way. It is interesting the rate of youth employment has crept up in the past six to nine months. I believe that is related to costs on SMEs.  Deputy Dolan is correct that retrofitting is the most effective way to reduce costs. Between 2019 and September 2025, the Government provided over €1.5 billion in support to homeowners for over 228,000 upgrades, including 30,000 fully funded retrofits under the warmer homes scheme. It is estimated that if a deep retrofit is done, it can save a household up to €1,100 per year in energy costs. I get the Deputy's point that the administration of it needs to be faster. There is also resource demand in respect of it as well with some people not being able to afford to do retrofits because of the cost.  On Deputy Ó Murchú's issue, I do not have the specifics on Ardee Educate Together National School. I do not know what the interaction with the county council is, but in any event----- \n Deputy Ruairí Ó Murchú  The refusal to change----- \n The Taoiseach  They should sort it out. A school is an important facility. The county council should be facilitative in the building of a school. \n Deputy Ruairí Ó Murchú  It is not just the council. \n The Taoiseach  Deputy O'Rourke raised regulation online. We have now established the regulatory framework governing online. There is ongoing review in respect of it. Children must be protected. That has to be the optimal.  Deputy Coppinger raised healthcare assistants and family reunification. We have significant reunification in Ireland under our migration system, in particular when people leave direct provision who have residency. The Minister will bring forward legislation in respect of this and these are issues we can discuss in greater detail at that stage.  On Deputy Murphy's point, I will talk to the Ministers responsible. There has to be proper regulation of management companies. There are fundamental rights involved in terms of those complexes. I will pursue that with the Minister and see where we are in terms of amendment to primary legislation.  Deputy Quaide raised the issue of counselling and psychotherapy. On qualification frameworks and regulators generally, we want more therapists, but they have to be highly qualified. Public health is number one and the protection of the consumer. In some instances, they can be quite protectionist as well. The judgment called for regulators and I would like CORU to get the judgment right in terms of not having the bar so high that there are only highly qualified, and others are not. That is not just in terms of therapy and counselling; that is in terms of teaching and a range of other issues.  Deputy Conway-Walsh raised the regulation of quarries. I will talk to the Minister involved in that. We can overregulate too but I take the Deputy's point about the quality of aggregate and quality of the product. There are existing systems to deal with that. The SEAI is there. There are various regulatory bodies to deal with the quality of materials, but I will talk to the Minister in respect of that. New bodies were set up after the defective blocks scheme.  Deputy Boyd Barrett raised taxi regulation. I will talk to the Minister about the issues that the Deputy raised. There is a balance between consumers, those availing of taxis and the regulation of same. We had regulation a long time ago; it did not work. There was always an imbalance between supply and demand. I will look at this and will talk to the Minister for Transport in respect of it. He is fully aware of it. \n An Ceann Comhairle  We have a delegation of students visiting from Ukraine as our part of our EPAS programme hosted by Maynooth Post Primary School. They are most welcome. We had their president here yesterday, which we enjoyed immensely. ",

        "answerText": " Minister for Rural and Community Development and the Gaeltacht  The main purpose of the Dormant Accounts Acts is to reunite account holders with their funds. Unclaimed funds are transferred to the Dormant Accounts Fund, which is managed by the National Treasury Management Agency. The beneficial owner has a right to reclaim their money at any time.  The Department of Rural and Community Development and the Gaeltacht has responsibility for the overall administration of the Dormant Accounts Fund, with individual Government Departments responsible for the delivery and administration of their own measures. All measures funded must be in line with the objectives set out in the legislation, that is, to address economic, social or educational disadvantage or to support persons with a disability.  With regard to the current value of funding available for the Dormant Accounts Fund, at the end of October 2025 there was €217 million in the Dormant Accounts Fund, which is held and managed by the National Treasury Management Agency (NTMA). Of this, €138 million is held in reserve by the NTMA, for future reclaims. This leaves €79 million available for disbursement to measures. This will be supplemented by inflows in April 2026, the level of which depends on the number of accounts becoming dormant.  My Department published the 2026 Dormant Accounts Fund Action Plan in November 2025. It outlines measures and funding across 11 Departments, with total funding of €46.97 million to support 56 measures. These measures will be funded from the above available funding, and the future inflows in April 2026.  Ensuring a sustainable use of this funding is central to the work of my Department, and future levels of funding are dependant on the levels of inflow into the fund. It is envisaged that, to sustain the Fund, expenditure will need to be gradually reduced to €40 million per year going forward. As the fund is made up of monies from dormant accounts, and the funds can be reclaimed at any time by the beneficial owner, it is difficult to predict future net transfers into the fund - and therefore final decision need to made based on actual levels of inflows each year.  Further information on the Dormant Accounts Fund, including all published Action Plans and Annual reports, is available on my Department’s website at the following link: www.gov.ie/en/department-of-rural-and-community-development-and-the-gaeltacht/policy-information/dormant-accounts-fund/.

        "answerText": " Deputy Liam Quaide  Has the Minister, her immediate predecessor or anyone in her Department engaged with the UK authorities regarding the Palestine Action group, which was proscribed as a terrorist organisation by the UK Government in July? The group was blacklisted for instigating a number of direct action protests against weapons manufacturers involved in selling arms to Israel in the context of its campaign of genocide and ethnic cleansing in Gaza against the civilian population there since October 2023. \n Deputy Helen McEntee  Ireland maintains regular and constructive dialogue with UK authorities at all levels on a wide range of matters. In the last week, I have engaged with my UK counterpart since taking up office and I look forward to meeting with the UK's Foreign Secretary, Ms Yvette Cooper, shortly to take forward our co-operation on a range of foreign policy issues.  An important area of engagement between the UK and Ireland is on Middle East policy, including the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. I particularly welcome the British Government's decision in September to formally recognise the State of Palestine and its active engagement in the 20-point peace plan to end the conflict in Gaza, which was endorsed by the UN Security Council on 17 November.  I welcome the ceasefire and hostage release deal in Gaza as an important step on the road to peace. Our focus is now on preserving the ceasefire and ensuring that humanitarian aid flows into and throughout Gaza. Ireland has been clear that all parties must adhere to their commitments in full, desist from any actions inconsistent with what has been agreed and continue to negotiate in good faith to ensure full implementation.  In respect of the British Government's decision to designate Palestinian Action as a terrorist organisation under its Terrorism Act, I understand that this decision is subject to judicial review and is currently before the High Court in London. The Deputy will appreciate that I cannot comment on a live case that is before the British courts, in the same way that I would not comment on something that is before the Irish courts. More broadly, though, the Government remains committed to upholding human rights, including those pertaining to freedom of expression and the right to peaceful protest, both domestically and internationally. These fundamental rights are enshrined in international human rights instruments to which both Ireland and the United Kingdom are signatories. These are issues that would regularly be discussed as part of overall political dialogue between Ireland and all of its partners, including the UK.  My Department will continue to monitor developments in this area, including in respect of any cases involving Irish citizens. The provision of consular assistance to Irish citizens is an important element of the work of my Department. Consular assistance is provided in a strictly confidential manner and, as with all cases, my Department does not comment on the details of individual cases. That said, we are there to support any Irish citizens. \n Deputy Liam Quaide  The UK Government has, in an Orwellian inversion of truth, conflated protest against genocide with terrorism through its proscription of the Palestine Action group, placing it, absurdly, on the same blacklist as organisations such as al-Qaeda and ISIS. Since the Palestine Action group has been designated a terrorist organisation, at least 2,300 people have been arrested according to the group Defend Our Juries, and a large proportion of these arrests took place at peaceful, sit-in protests in public areas across August and September of this year. Those arrested have included young students, teachers, pensioners and even an 83-year-old retired vicar.  The United Nations human rights chief, Mr. Volker Türk, said that the UK Government’s designation is “disturbing” and “disproportionate and unnecessary”, while the Council of Europe, Europe’s human rights watchdog, criticised the “excessive limits” it places on the right to protest. Does the Minister plan to raise the protection of the right to protest when she next engages with her UK counterpart? \n Deputy Helen McEntee  Again, as I said already, as this is before the courts, I will not specifically reference what the Deputy has outlined. What I will do is restate and emphasise Ireland's absolute support for and commitment to a person's right to peacefully protest, which is extremely important. We also place a very strong emphasis on making sure that any Irish citizens abroad who find themselves in difficulty, whether relating to something like this or otherwise, would have consular assistance. Again, I stress that if any citizens need that assistance, it is there and available to them. Of course, in my engagement with Ms Yvette Cooper or anyone else in the UK Government, I will stress that this is an area that Ireland is very clear and very strong on. Individuals have a right to peaceful protest on matters that are concerning to them. Obviously, where that crosses the line and there is violence and use of force, we move into a different space, but we uphold every individual's international right to peaceful protest. That is certainly something that I can and will raise with my counterpart when I meet her, hopefully in the weeks ahead. \n Deputy Liam Quaide  The acclaimed and best-selling Irish author, Sally Rooney, was unable to collect her recent Sky Arts award for literature in person as she did not feel safe entering the UK due to the risk of arrest for her public support of Palestine Action. She has even had to cancel all future public engagements in the UK and has expressed concerns that because of her intention to support Palestine Action financially, the availability of her books in the UK could be affected. One of the leading Irish authors of our time does not now feel she can enter the UK because of her support for a group protesting genocide. This is just one example of how the UK’s designation of Palestine Action as a terrorist organisation begins to seep into every corner of society and constrains the right of Irish citizens as well as British citizens to speak the truth at this darkest time in our history.  What meaningful engagement does the Minister plan to have with her UK counterpart about the UK Government's treatment and prosecution of members of Palestine Action? Will the Minister push for the UK Government to end its designation of the group as a terror organisation? \n Deputy Helen McEntee  Again, as this is currently before the courts, it is not an issue I can raise with my UK counterpart or discuss here today. What I can and will say to my colleague when we meet is that there is an absolutely necessity to uphold the individual's right to peaceful protest. This is something that we cherish in this country. More broadly, in terms of our support for Palestine, there has been unanimous support for the need to reach a ceasefire. I very much welcome the ceasefire that has been reached, albeit that it is very fragile and difficult. I also very much welcome the fact that hostages have been released and that humanitarian aid has started to flow into Gaza, albeit, again, not at the level that it needs to be. We need to make sure that every single one of our actions now cements and upholds the ceasefire that is currently in place. I have no doubt that citizens in Ireland will continue to raise their voices, to make sure their concerns are heard and to work collectively continue to do everything we can to ensure that the ceasefire holds. For any citizens of Ireland in the UK or anywhere else who need consular assistance, it is there and available to them. We need to make sure that as a country we reiterate and stress every individual's human right to peaceful protest and that is certainly something I will do with my UK colleague. ",

        "showAs": " 10. Deputy Liam Quaide asked the Taoiseach when the Cabinet committee on Northern Ireland will next meet. [65438/25] ",
        "answerText": " The Taoiseach  I propose to take Questions Nos. 1 to 13, inclusive, together.  The Cabinet subcommittee on Northern Ireland was created on 18 February 2025 to oversee implementation of relevant programme for Government commitments and ongoing developments in relation to Northern Ireland, Irish-British relations, and the shared island initiative. As well as considering issues relevant to the Government's position as a co-guarantor of the Good Friday Agreement, including our role in Good Friday Agreement institutions such as the North-South Ministerial Council, the British-Irish Council and the British-Irish Intergovernmental Conference, topics for discussion also include the annual UK-Ireland summits and their agreed programme of work and the continued roll-out and development of the investment, research and dialogue strands of the shared island initiative.  On 17 October, I chaired the 30th plenary meeting of the North-South Ministerial Council in Farmleigh House, Dublin. The Northern Ireland Executive was led by the First Minister, Michelle O'Neill, MLA, and the deputy First Minister, Emma Little-Pengelly, MLA. We had constructive discussions on areas of mutual issues, including business and trade matters, infrastructure and investment co-operation, and tackling gender-based violence. Our discussion also included a new agenda item on emergency planning and preparedness. We also had updates by all Ministers on North-South co-operation under their portfolios, ranging from day-to-day cross-Border engagement to major infrastructural projects. The event was preceded by a dinner at Farmleigh with Government and Northern Ireland Ministers on 16 October.  On 18 November, the Government announced allocations of over €50 million from the shared island fund for ten new projects to be delivered as part of the initiative over 2026 to 2030. Among the projects are €14 million for a major new shared island media initiative to be taken forward by Coimisiún na Meán, €5.9 million to develop cross-Border emergency management capacity on flood response and rescue operations, particularly with resources for technology and so forth, and €2 million to enable a new Dublin-Derry PSO air service to start in 2026.  Next week, along with the Tánaiste, I will attend a summit meeting of the British-Irish Council in Wales where the focus of our discussions will be on the creative industries across these islands. The Cabinet committee on Northern Ireland will continue to meet biannually on these and related matters. We will be meeting again next on 8 December. \n An Ceann Comhairle  I ask Members to please be brief and concise, as the Taoiseach needs to respond. \n Deputy Brendan Smith  I thank the Taoiseach for his reply. As he is aware, there was a general welcome for the legacy framework that was published jointly by the Irish and British Governments in early September. Could he let us know what progress is being made in bringing forward the necessary legislation to enact that framework and to ensure that all of these issues are dealt with through putting the victims first and at the centre of the framework and the modus operandi of dealing with these legacy issues?  Another thing I have consistently raised is the Belturbet bombing of December 1972 and the Dublin-Monaghan bombings of 1974. Again, the British Government has not co-operated to the extent necessary to ensure a comprehensive investigation into the Dublin-Monaghan bombings. Will the Taoiseach let us know if that will continue to be on the agenda in all discussions at Government level with his British counterparts? \n Deputy Erin McGreehan  I would like the Taoiseach to outline whether the Cabinet committee discussed the cross-Border economy, particularly in counties such as Louth where these issues are felt most acutely. Will there be specific actions in relation to tax and administrative complications facing cross-Border workers, including the differentiations between the pricing of alcohol and fuel between both jurisdictions and the impact of that in the distortion of local trade and the undermining of businesses and broader communities?  I support my colleague Deputy Smith in relation to the bombings. I also highlight that it will have been 50 years this December since the Dundalk bombing where people tragically lost their lives. \n Deputy Barry Heneghan  Regarding the cross-Border organisation Foras na Gaeilge, if it had the same growth as the Arts Council, Foras na Gaeilge's budget would now be €50 million. Instead of that, níl sé ach €17 milliún. I welcome the raise in the recent budget to Foras na Gaeilge's funding, but how will the Taoiseach ensure that this additional funding is made available, given that 25% of it is from the North? \n Deputy Ruairí Ó Murchú  I have often brought up the positives regarding the shared island unit. I believe the project in relation to DkIT and its partnership with Queen's University Belfast could fit into that. However, a number of other issues arise, whether we are talking about the remote working issues that have an impact on taxation or exam certification. In fairness to Deputy McGreehan, she has brought up the issue of the disparity regarding fuel. I have spoken before about the need for some sort of means of putting these issues on the agenda properly and dealing with them.  We have made the call for a long time to get down to the issue of constitutional change and the need for a means - call it a citizens' assembly or a forum - by which this conversation can happen. The State must properly prepare for Irish unity. There has been an abject failure to do so and we cannot just wait until everybody gets on together. We need to prepare now and the onus is on the State to do it. \n Deputy Cormac Devlin  I thank the Taoiseach for the update on the work of the Cabinet subcommittee. As Cathaoirleach of the Committee on the Implementation of the Good Friday Agreement, we have had good engagements North and South. That is continuing next week with visiting MPs from Westminster. Dialogue is important in terms of the Government's good relationship with London as well as Belfast.  May I also raise the case of the 265 students and teachers who were kidnapped in Niger state in Nigeria? It is a very serious case and I would like to know what is happening there. \n Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett  Last week, I raised with the Taoiseach - I want to do so again because it is important - the fact that, as part of a wider attack by the British Government on those standing in solidarity with the people of Palestine and against Israel's genocide in Gaza, people in the North are being arrested and charged, including one of our councillors, Councillor Shaun Harkin in Derry, for indicating supporting support for Palestine Action. The designation by the Starmer Government of Palestine Action as a terrorist group is outrageous when what the group has been trying to do is stop Israeli terrorism and genocide by trying to disrupt the ability of the British state and Israeli companies to collaborate with Israel in the genocidal assault on the people of Palestine. It is happening in the North. Arrests are taking place. There was a protest this weekend where people declared their support for Palestine Action. It should not be a chargeable offence and the Taoiseach should speak out against it. \n Deputy Paul Murphy  For 15 months, an Irish citizen from County Antrim has been held without trial in an English prison and has had his rights denied. Jordan Devlin is being locked inside for 23 and a half hours per day. He is being strip searched twice daily. His mail has been withheld, his visits are blocked and his calls are denied. His sister said, \"They put him on public protection so he can't speak to anyone\". She also said:  They often don’t have vegetarian food so he can't eat. They're x-raying him and strip-searching him twice a day. He's freezing too.  He is a Palestine solidarity activist. He is charged with regard to a protest action at Elbit Systems. Elbit is the largest supplier of weapons to the Israeli genocide. He denies all the charges. His trial begins today but his judge was swapped out yesterday with no stated justification. The question is whether the Irish Government has made any representations on his behalf and whether the Taoiseach has sought to ensure that his basic rights as a prisoner and a defendant are defended as opposed to being ridden roughshod over like many other Palestine protesters. \n Deputy Ivana Bacik  I thank the Taoiseach for the update. I welcome the developments with the shared island fund. It is now clearer than it has ever been that conversations about the constitutional future of the island are picking up steam. I would dispute the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland's recent claim that there was no appetite for constitutional change in Northern Ireland. I see that the leader of the SDLP Claire Hanna and others contested that claim. In the absence of leadership from the British Government and in keeping with the principles in the Good Friday Agreement-Belfast Agreement, it is essential for our Government to take on a role of preparing in earnest for the work necessary to lay the groundwork and foundations for running a referendum on unity. We need a clear timeline to allow for that necessary groundwork to take place, to develop Green and White Papers, to allow for the work of citizens' assemblies to take place and to see progress made building on the work of the shared island unit in advance of the 30th anniversary of the Good Friday Agreement-Belfast Agreement. The Taoiseach said that the next meeting of the Cabinet subcommittee would be on 8 December. As we approach 2028, what substantive steps will that Cabinet subcommittee be announcing in terms of bringing the debate further? \n Deputy Rose Conway-Walsh  At last week's session of the Committee on the Implementation of the Good Friday Agreement, we had a profound contribution from the All-Island Cancer Research Institute and the All-Island Congenital Heart Disease Network. It highlighted once again what we have known for some time, namely, that lives can be saved and healthcare can only be delivered to an optimum level across the island when we have an all-island approach to healthcare for the 7 million people living on the island. It makes zero sense on a small island such as ours financially or otherwise to have two healthcare systems operating simultaneously. Until such time as we have a referendum on Irish unity and an opportunity to design a new and modern all-island, world-class service, I ask the Taoiseach and the Minister for Health to set aside a permanent allocation in the health budget for the delivery of healthcare on an all-island basis, utilising North-South collaboration to improve outcomes for patients in both jurisdictions and maximise the wonderful clinical expertise on the island. \n Deputy Eoin Hayes  The renewed calls for a border poll on reunification in recent months point to a definite direction of travel on the issue of a united Ireland and on that question moving from the realm of the idealistic to the practical. My party and I would welcome the opportunity to advocate for reunification and believe that a united Ireland achieved by truly informed communities North and South in a process defined by consent and deliberative consensus has the real potential to benefit the people of the entire island. However, I am concerned that as the chances of a border poll in the next ten or 15 years continue to rise to that of political inevitability, we are running out of time to ensure it takes place in such an environment. Will the Government commit to the establishment of citizens' assemblies, work towards cross-Border fora on health, economics and education and set out a positive vision? \n Deputy Peadar Tóibín  The purpose of the British legacy Bill was to grant to amnesty to those who had killed innocent civilians. There appears to be a significant contradiction in the position of the Irish and British Governments in the new joint framework that seeks to replace that. The British Government is briefing that there will be safeguards for British army veterans. I asked Simon Harris this question and he said that was separate from the joint framework and that the British were looking for their own safeguards in their own legislation. Would that separate treatment for British army veterans not undermine a joint framework? Would it not create a lop-sided justice system in the Six Counties? Will that protection for veterans apply to both sides of the conflict? Will the British secretary of state retain a veto over the disclosure of the role of paid British agents in the Troubles and will former RUC officers who played a significant role in the Troubles be part of the investigative system that is put in place? \n Deputy Conor D. McGuinness  Tá Coimisinéir Teanga nua ceaptha sna Sé Chontae, Pól Deeds. Is coiscéim chun tosaigh é seo i ndiaidh tréimhse an-fhada ag feitheamh dá leithéid. Tá Gaeilge agus pobal na Gaeilge faoi ionsaí sna Sé Chontae faoi láthair. Conas a dhéanfaidh an Taoiseach cosaint ar an bpobal seo, ar lucht labhartha na Gaeilge ó Thuaidh?  While I am on my feet, I want to raise the situation of Jordan Devlin, an Irish citizen from County Antrim who is on remand in Britain awaiting charges relating to pro-Palestinian activism there. I see this in the wider context of a crackdown on political dissent and political protest in Britain. Has the Taoiseach raised, or will he raise, this situation with the British authorities to ensure he is treated fairly in prison and will be afforded a fair trial? \n The Taoiseach  I thank all of the Deputies for raising a variety of issues. Deputy Brendan Smith was first up. In respect of the legacy framework, the measures announced in the joint framework were published in September and provide a pathway to truth and accountability. That is why I went to London to meet Keir Starmer. It was one of those trips. I take it that people accept that we have to go to London every now and again to meet the Prime Minister. It was to make sure we got the legacy Bill over the line because it is an important piece of legislation that is certainly far superior to the previous legacy Act of the last British Government.  The British Government published the Bill amending the 2023 legacy Act on 14 October, so that is the progress the Deputy was asking for. The second reading of that Bill took place in the House of Commons on 18 November. To be fair, we believe that represents speed and demonstrates the seriousness with which they are approaching this essential work. The key test for us will be whether it faithfully reflects what is in the joint framework. The Minister, Deputy McEntee, and the UK secretary of state, Hilary Benn, discussed the legacy framework in their introductory call last week.  The Tánaiste and the Minister, Deputy O'Callaghan, also discussed this with the secretary of state, Mr. Benn, at the British-Irish Intergovernmental Conference, which took place on 17 November because we, too, have responsibilities in this jurisdiction. While we can only legislate once the UK legislation is enacted, the Minister for justice, Jim O'Callaghan, has said he is hopeful that the general scheme of the Bill will be published in April or May of next year. Enabling reciprocal co-operation between the two jurisdictions is absolutely at the heart of the agreed joint framework on legacy. The Garda Commissioner is also committed to the establishment by the end of this year of a dedicated unit as a central point of contact in relation to Troubles-related investigations undertaken by An Garda Síochána. That is also in the joint framework. An Garda Síochána has also committed, where possible, to answer questions that a family may have in relation to the investigation of a Troubles-related incident and provide a report to the family.  In respect of the Belturbet and Dublin-Monaghan bombings, the publication of the Denton report may very well shed light on the Dublin-Monaghan bombings. We have to await the outcome of that. I know it is into the Glenanne Gang and the atrocities they perpetrated, but that will be important. I know that Deputy Smith has been a strong advocate on the Belturbet and Dublin-Monaghan bombings.  Deputy McGreehan raised a very important point about the treatment for tax purposes of workers who cross the Border. We do not have that resolved yet. There have been ongoing issues, or attempts to do that, between the respective Departments of finance and I am pushing through the cross-Border bodies and through the Department of Finance to get some progress on that. We are also working with employers and unions through the LEEF process to see can we make progress on it. It is an issue for the seamless transfer of workers North to South and South to North.  It is more difficult in terms of harmonisation of prices North and South. Different Governments have different policies. I have not seen today's budget in respect of the UK yet but that could even bring in more taxation. We do not know how that will manifest.  I am conscious also that it is 50 years since the Dundalk bombing.  Maidir le ceist an Teachta Heneghan, tá deacracht ann toisc an gaol atá ann. Tá dualgas ar an Executive airgead a chur ar fáil d’Fhoras na Gaeilge agus caithfimid an rud céanna a dhéanamh. Is féidir linn níos mó a chur ar fáil. Trí shared island, tá níos mó á dhéanamh againn, maraon leis an méid atá ag teacht go hoifigiúil ón Rialtas, chun gnóthaí trí Ghaeilge a chothú agus tacaíocht a thabhairt. Mar sin beimid ag déanamh sin. I will come back to the shared island initiative later.  Deputy Ó Murchú and others raised constitutional issues and so on. I think reconciliation cannot be postponed, Deputy. \n Deputy Ruairí Ó Murchú  I did not say it could be. \n The Taoiseach  The Deputy kind of said we could not wait. \n Deputy Ruairí Ó Murchú  The Taoiseach said waiting on a perfect----- \n The Taoiseach  I know. I am not trying to----- \n Deputy Ruairí Ó Murchú  He said we wait on a perfect----- \n An Ceann Comhairle  Deputy, please. The Taoiseach is answering the questions. \n The Taoiseach  I just think we need to really focus on reconciliation on a constant, constant basis. \n Deputy Ruairí Ó Murchú  That is okay. \n The Taoiseach  It is hard work but it does bear great fruit in terms of the North and South and different traditions and political backgrounds within the North as well. \n Deputy Peadar Tóibín  It is more likely to happen in a united Ireland. \n An Ceann Comhairle  Deputy, this is not a back and forth. \n The Taoiseach  It is very important that we consistently do that. I do not think citizens' assemblies are in any shape or form an appropriate route for discussing the future of Ireland or the constitutional framework into the future. \n Deputy Ruairí Ó Murchú  In a forum. \n Deputy Peadar Tóibín  The New Ireland Forum. \n The Taoiseach  I just do not believe it at all, because anyone who knows anything about the North - and I have been involved all my life politically; I have been involved in discussions about the devolution of justice, for example, and I was in the Government when the Good Friday Agreement was first signed - knows it means people-to-people engagement. It means political parties engaging. It means political traditions as well as independent politicians or people who have a view. Citizens' assemblies can be closed enough in some respects and they can be a percentage of a random percentage of the population. There were some good citizens' assemblies but for something as overarching as a future constitutional framework - I just want to give my view on this - from my experience, it simply would not cut it. You would end up with a report----- \n Deputy Peadar Tóibín  The New Ireland Forum. \n Deputy Ruairí Ó Murchú  Then come up with an alternative. \n An Ceann Comhairle  Sorry, there is a structure on this debate. \n The Taoiseach  What I am always amused by----- \n Deputy Peadar Tóibín  We are just giving suggestions. \n An Ceann Comhairle  It is not allowed. \n The Taoiseach  Fianna Fáil as a party has committed to the North with great substance over the years - Charles Haughey, Albert Reynolds and Bertie Ahern in terms of the Good Friday Agreement. In this Government and the last, we did something that has never been done in the shared island initiative. Some €1 billion from 2020 to 2025 and beyond and another €1 billion in this programme for Government, which is bringing real substance. Instead of all the rhetoric and everything else, we are doing things. Part of that has also been a very important investment in real research into the different systems North and South - into our health systems, into education completion, into energy, into enterprise, and into ecology and climate. Good stuff has been done by the Economic and Social Research Institute. I defy the Deputies to go back over the last 100 years and come up with anything that parallels the level of research we have undertaken to try to understand better the different systems and different approaches.  Now, I will put a challenge to Sinn Féin. It has been talking about this for decades but it has not produced a scrap of paper in terms of----- \n Deputy Ruairí Ó Murchú  That is not true. \n Deputy Rose Conway-Walsh  That is not true. \n The Taoiseach  One second, please. I am just trying to make a point. \n Deputy Rose Conway-Walsh  Yes, but it is not the truth. \n An Ceann Comhairle  It is not a back and forth. \n Deputy Rose Conway-Walsh  Do not tell untruths. \n The Taoiseach  In terms of a blueprint, why is Sinn Féin afraid to bring forward a blueprint? \n Deputy Rose Conway-Walsh  You are the Taoiseach. \n An Ceann Comhairle  There are seven other Deputies, Taoiseach. \n Deputy Rose Conway-Walsh  You are the leader. \n The Taoiseach  I know. \n An Ceann Comhairle  It is not a back and forth. \n The Taoiseach  We are taking our responses in terms of the Good Friday Agreement. \n Deputy Conor D. McGuinness  You lead the Government. \n The Taoiseach  I believe in the unity of the Irish people, okay,----- \n An Ceann Comhairle  Seven other Deputies, Taoiseach. \n The Taoiseach  -----but I would say to the Deputies that with everything Sinn Féin does, the onus is on the Government. The Government will take its responsibilities in relation to this but----- \n Deputy David Cullinane  I have brought forward a plan for healthcare. I will send it on to you. \n The Taoiseach  -----fo a party I would have thought was so committed as Sinn Féin is rhetorically - it keeps going on about it - it has produced very little in terms of what it believes the blueprint should be. \n Deputy Rose Conway-Walsh  We have done several studies. \n An Ceann Comhairle  Just to remind----- \n The Taoiseach  That is the point I would make----- \n Deputy Ruairí Ó Murchú  And we have engaged. \n The Taoiseach  -----because the party always wants us to produce the blueprint. \n Deputy Ruairí Ó Murchú  That is because we are not in power. \n The Taoiseach  By the way, Fianna Fáil will not be found wanting, nor will other parties, in terms of delivering substance in respect of this issue. \n Deputy Ruairí Ó Murchú  You are the Government. \n An Ceann Comhairle  Taoiseach, just to remind you there are seven other Deputies. \n The Taoiseach  That is covering all the seven really. There are a good few----- \n Deputy Peadar Tóibín  But it is not getting us anywhere. \n An Ceann Comhairle  No, the next seven, including Deputy Boyd Barrett. \n The Taoiseach  Deputy Devlin made a very important point and he has done very good work as Chair of the Good Friday committee. I certainly think he is correct in respect of what has happened in Nigeria. At the European Union-African Union Summit, that was raised in terms of what Boko Haram and various jihadist groups were doing in terms of the persecution and killing of many people, but Christians as well, and the kidnapping of young girls and so on. I appreciate the point the Deputy raised there.  To Deputy Boyd Barrett on the issues around Palestine Action, all of our embassies and so on provide whatever consular supports to any Irish citizen who is on remand or in prison. We always provide whatever supports we can or whatever assistance but we do not and obviously cannot interfere in the criminal justice system. I will review the case of Jordan Devlin and I will ask again our ambassador in London for an update in respect of that. \n Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett  You should speak out against Starmer's policy. \n An Ceann Comhairle  Please, Deputy. \n Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett  It is a disgraceful policy. \n The Taoiseach  I have no issue with people - obviously, I do not - supporting Palestinians. I do have an issue - I am not saying this happened in these cases at all because I do not know the full detail of them - but I read recently of a case where there was a ramming of building in London, so it is not as black and white as the Deputy has articulated, or even here where people drive through gates and barriers and do criminal damage. TDs' offices have had criminal damage by, I would say, more extreme elements of people who were involved in supporting the Palestinian movement, unfortunately. It is true. My own office was damaged three times. I know other TDs whose offices were damaged. \n Deputy Erin McGreehan  Hear, hear. \n The Taoiseach  So, is that acceptable? Is that legitimate protest? No, it is not. When there are people working in those offices, they do not think it is legitimate. All I am saying is we all have to be clear on the demarcation line. I am not familiar with the individual cases here in terms of the alleged crimes and so on like that, but let us not try to pretend that everything is just all one way because----- \n Deputy Paul Murphy  But in Britain, if you just hold a sign saying \"Free Palestine Action\", you can be arrested. \n An Ceann Comhairle  Please, Deputy Murphy. \n The Taoiseach  -----one thing I do know----- \n Deputy Paul Murphy  That is crazy. \n An Ceann Comhairle  This is orchestrated. I ask you to stop interrupting. \n The Taoiseach  One thing I do know is either on the far right or the far left, people do transgress the lines and let us not pretend they do not. They have in this country in the past. There clearly are other issues in the UK----- \n Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett  I think you will find the Israelis are the transgressors. \n The Taoiseach  -----and so on like that. Look, some people were trying to stop Dublin Port the other day. \n Deputy Paul Murphy  And they got bashed, did they not? \n An Ceann Comhairle  Taoiseach, I do not know if you intend to take any other questions. \n Deputy Paul Murphy  They got battered by gardaí, did they not? \n The Taoiseach  Well, they should not be trying to stop----- \n Deputy Paul Murphy  Did the Taoiseach support the gardaí battering them? \n The Taoiseach  Some 80% of trade in this country goes through Dublin Port and you guys want to wreck it. That is bread on the table. Workers all over the country depend on trade going through Dublin Port. As far as the Deputies are concerned, that should be stopped in its tracks. There are demarcation lines that we have to be very clear about. The right to protest----- \n Deputy Paul Murphy  They were protesting trade with Israel. \n The Taoiseach  -----is a sacred right in this country. We should cherish that and we should never do anything to damage it, nor should others.  I think I have dealt with the issue Deputy Bacik raised in my general response. I do not believe a citizens' assembly is the right way to go.  Deputy Conway-Walsh spoke about the cancer consortium. I helped to set that up originally. We are supporting it. On congenital heart disease, there was a very good agreement and there are cross-Border health initiatives including, for example, an initiative to treat children's hearts in Crumlin. There is more we can do. There is a cancer centre at Altnagelvin. I do not know if the Deputy has seen that. The Republic provided a lot of funding for that. There are also other services. I am all for that. We are researching whether we can provide better primary care services North and South and whether hospital resources can be combined. Deputy McGreehan made a point to me about two hospitals, one of which was Daisy Hill Hospital, where more stuff could be done. We have been working on that through various initiatives. I am all for that. We will continue to do that in conjunction with the ESRI and NESC.  I have given my views on the issue raised by Deputy Eoin Hayes. We have established all-island forums through the shared island initiative. Through that initiative, we have created a climate and biodiversity network, an all-island women's forum and an all-island youth forum where young people get together and talk about the future and about their lives. We have also developed the first all-island music archive, combining music from different traditions in the one archive. That is being funded through the shared island unit. There is a lot happening on the ground. People are just getting together. I was at an event two weeks ago. It was fantastic. People from east Belfast were doing tapestries with people from Inishbofin. Some of them had never been in the Republic before. Some of those from the South had never been in the North. We have a long way to go but we need to do this right and properly.  To respond to Deputy Conor McGuinness, is maith an rud é go bhfuil an coimisinéir teanga nua ann sa Tuaisceart. Tá Acht ann anois. Tá reachtaíocht curtha i láthair. Is dócha go bhfuil an-chuid oibre le déanamh ag an gcoimisinéir chun é sin a chur i bhfeidhm. Níl an reachtaíocht sin lán-cosúil leis an reachtaíocht atá againn anseo. Más féidir linn aon tacaíocht a thabhairt dó agus do ghluaiseacht na Gaeilge sa Tuaisceart, beimid sásta é sin a dhéanamh. Tá a lán déanta againn ach táimid sásta i bhfad níos mó a dhéanamh. \n Deputy Peadar Tóibín  Will the Taoiseach address the lopsided protections for veterans? \n The Taoiseach  Again, they were not negotiated by this Government, nor are they part of the joint framework. It is our understanding that the accommodation made for witnesses should apply in the cases of all victims equally, regardless of the perspective being brought to the matter. \n Deputy Peadar Tóibín  It is a problem then. \n An Ceann Comhairle  The Taoiseach has another 15 minutes. Did he answer Deputy McGuinness's question? \n The Taoiseach  I did. \n An Ceann Comhairle  You did. I am sorry; I was distracted. I would like to welcome a member of the Down's syndrome community, Declan Moran, who is here with Deputy Albert Dolan. You are very welcome, Declan. \n The Taoiseach  You are very welcome, Declan. ",

        "showAs": " 27. Deputy Liam Quaide asked the Taoiseach if he will report on the programme plan for his Department’s new disability unit for 2025-2027. [65439/25] ",
        "answerText": " An Ceann Comhairle  We have 15 to 16 minutes left. There are 20 Deputies to speak on the next question. I propose to divide the time remaining after the Taoiseach's opening statement between a number of Deputies. \n The Taoiseach  It is a brilliant statement. \n An Ceann Comhairle  The Taoiseach will have to try to be brief. \n The Taoiseach  I jest. \n Deputy Peadar Tóibín  It is all in the delivery. \n The Taoiseach  I will try to cut it short to allow others to come in. I propose to take Questions Nos. 14 to 35, inclusive, together.  I established the disability unit in the Department to bring about a renewed focus and urgency and out of a desire to drive progress on disability issues. The unit's first programme plan, published in September, outlines how the unit will drive the delivery of the Government's new national disability strategy, working across government to make the ambitions a reality. In particular, the unit will look to drive innovation, to get things done, to bring momentum to policy implementation, to troubleshoot, where appropriate, to improve the delivery of services, and to get strategic thinking on future challenges. The unit will also support the Cabinet committee on disability.  The first programme plan for the unit outlines ten priority areas for the period from 2025 to 2027 across five workstreams. The first workstream relates to transforming children's disability services, early years education and health. The second is about increasing system capacity and the third is about opening doors and addressing barriers to employment pathways and supports. The fourth relates to implementing the national disability strategy and the fifth is on planning and designing for the future. The programme plan allows for further workstreams to be assigned to the unit as may be needed.  We do not want to duplicate the work of Ministers or Departments but to support them in improving services and getting things done. It is already up and running. The Cabinet committee on disability has met five times to date. With the support of the unit, we have looked at the new national disability strategy. As the House will know, that has gone through and has now been published. The provision of therapists in special schools is up and running. Some €16 million has been allocated for that this year. There have also been improvements to the delivery of services and the assessment of need process is being reformed, which includes legislative reform.  The budget was impacted by the unit and the Cabinet subcommittee and there was a significant focus on disability, particularly the income disregards for carer's allowance, among other initiatives and payments. The budget also provided a record €3.8 billion allocation towards specialist disability services. This represents a 20% increase year on year. That is to provide permanent dedicated funding for essential disability services. The investment in children's disability services will provide therapy services and strengthen the children's disability network teams through the provision of additional staff and so forth. Some €20 million was targeted at the assessment of need waitlist initiative, providing up to 6,500 clinical assessments. We are developing our budget spotlight on disability. That will be published in due course. It relates to the last budget but will also provide further thinking with regard to future budgets. We are also looking at developments in the area of transport and mobility. We are awaiting proposals from the Departments of Transport and Finance in that regard. \n An Ceann Comhairle  I propose to take the first six Deputies and to allow the Taoiseach six minutes to respond. \n Deputy Pádraig O'Sullivan  This is a topic the Taoiseach is very familiar with. He has visited the Rainbow Club on dozens of occasions at this stage and knows the great work that Jon, Karen and the board do. When Senator Rabbitte was the Minister of State, she was the first to allocate funding to the Rainbow Club under a service level agreement to provide respite care for children. As the Taoiseach will know, every week, over 1,200 children avail of this service, which is provided on a shoestring budget. The Taoiseach will be very familiar with the difficulties the club had in acquiring a nearby site, the former HSE ambulance building. It now has that building and has been lucky enough to engage an architect who is a professional in this field pro bono to design a bespoke building that is fit for the club's purposes. We need to move this project on. We need the HSE and the Government to support it financially to deliver it. It is going to be a massive undertaking for the charity. What is the Taoiseach's office going to do to advance the project? \n Deputy Ruairí Ó Murchú  The National Human Rights Strategy for Disabled People 2025-2030 was launched with great fanfare but we await the action plan. There is much talk of accountability. Will the Taoiseach give me a timeline for the introduction of that action plan? Who will be taking the lead, particularly with regard to oversight and accountability? Will it be the unit, the Cabinet committee or the Department of Children, Disability and Equality? How exactly will it work? How will we see improvements, whether in relation to assessments and therapies or the low level of disabled people who are involved in employment and the need for schemes that actually work? A lot of work is needed to make schemes such as the wage subsidy scheme and the work and access programme fit for purpose. \n Deputy Cian O'Callaghan  The level of unemployment among disabled people in Ireland is among the worst in Europe. I recently met with a number of disabled people in my constituency who have excellent qualifications and skills and who are willing and eager to work but who are stuck in unemployment. There are a number of barriers to employment that need to be removed. We are far behind other European countries in this regard. In 2021, the OECD released a report that made a number of recommendations as to how to tackle this. Those recommendations have still not been implemented. When will they be implemented in full?  What is the Government doing to tackle the scandalously high unemployment levels for disabled people in Ireland? \n Deputy Barry Heneghan  Bhí mé ag caint faoi seo dhá sheachtain ó shin agus an tseachtain seo caite. An rud atá i gceist ná Stapolin Educate Together National School in Baldoyle, which has a petition. Children from the school were in the Dáil last week. It needs two autism classrooms to be sanctioned by the Minister. There are eight children in mainstream classes with eligibility letters and a further 30 in the catchment area who are on waiting lists. This is a huge priority for me and I would love it to be addressed. \n Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett  David and Nicole have a five-year-old son with autism, and an older son. They live in a maisonette, which is 29 sq. m. It is absolutely tiny and rank with damp. Because of his autism, their son has serious sensory processing issues. He is a flight risk. I know these flats well. They have very dangerous concrete steps, which are a serious risk to him. Occupational therapists, medical professionals and people in school have said that he has to be got out of there as he cannot develop or do his occupational therapy if he is living in these conditions. Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council says autism is too prevalent in the community to give it medical priority. That is outrageous. The prevalence of a condition is not a reason to say it is not a priority if the child is in danger. If a child is in danger, it is a priority to get the child out of danger. \n An Ceann Comhairle  I appreciate that. The Taoiseach has the message. \n Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett  I would like there to be an intervention on that. \n Deputy Paul Murphy  The budget was a savage attack on disabled people. It took over €1,000 out of the pockets of disabled people and betrayed the promise in the programme for Government to introduce a permanent annual cost-of-disability support payment. The last time I asked about this, the Taoiseach claimed the cost of disability would be looked at in the next budget. The cost-of-living crisis is now. The cost-of-disability crisis is now. Some 70,000 people who are disabled or have a long-term illness are living in poverty. That is one in three. I have been inundated with emails from disabled people asking for winter cost-of-living and cost-of-disability payment. Many will be forced to choose between heating and eating this Christmas. They also want a permanent cost-of-disability payment without further delay. The Taoiseach has billions of euro in surplus. Do not be a Scrooge this Christmas. Please act on it. \n Deputy Peadar Tóibín  The children's disability network team, CDNT, in Meath is not fully staffed. According to statistics I received today, there are 20 vacant posts across disability teams in Kells, Dunshaughlin, Navan, Slane and Trim. Separate data received by Aontú today show that the Government is actually reducing the number of college places for speech and language therapists, from 370 in the year before Covid to 355 last year. The Government is reducing the number of students filling the necessary college places on an annual basis. What is the Taoiseach saying to parents whose children have been waiting for 14 months to see the CDNT in County Meath and to the children who are being bounced around endlessly from CAMHS, the CDNTs and other services? \n An Ceann Comhairle  Before the Taoiseach replies, could he maybe answer the other Deputies in writing?  Sixteen Deputies did not get to ask questions. They might get some form of response from the Taoiseach. \n The Taoiseach  You can bring some more of them in if you want, a Cheann Comhairle. \n An Ceann Comhairle  Only if the Taoiseach needs less time. We cannot go over the 45 minutes provided. \n The Taoiseach  I am not going to write replies to oral questions. I have given an overall response to everybody. \n An Ceann Comhairle  I am bound by the timelines set down. \n The Taoiseach  Do I have six minutes remaining? \n An Ceann Comhairle  Yes. \n The Taoiseach  I will get around to everybody who has asked a question. \n An Ceann Comhairle  I am talking about the Deputies who have not have not got in. \n Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett  The Taoiseach cannot really answer questions that have not been asked. \n An Ceann Comhairle  I know, but that is it. \n The Taoiseach  It is a new departure if I am going to do a written reply to every oral question. That is not on either. \n An Ceann Comhairle  The Taoiseach should go ahead. I suppose it is just a casualty of how interruptions affect the course of questions. To be fair, the Taoiseach cannot answer a question that has not been asked. We are delaying the answering process. \n Deputy Jennifer Whitmore  Could we even have 30 seconds to ask a question and then maybe the Taoiseach could respond? \n An Ceann Comhairle  No. We cannot go over time. I do not set the time. I do not have that discretion. \n Deputy Jennifer Whitmore  No, but we could stay within the time. \n An Ceann Comhairle  There are 15 Deputies left. \n The Taoiseach  Deputy Pádraig O'Sullivan raised the Rainbow Club, which is doing exceptional work. Jon and Karen O'Mahony have been exceptional leaders in that regard. The former Minister of State, now Senator Rabbitte, did good work on a service level agreement. I was involved in advocating for that building, which was a HSE building, to be allocated to the Rainbow Club. I will certainly continue to work with them and to support them with capital. What is important is that we get a timeline and some idea of how we can progress that as quickly as we possibly can. It is a very good, practical example of how a parent-led, community-based approach can develop services for autism in a nimble and flexible way that has helped so many families.  Deputy Ó Murchú asked about the action plan. That will come.  I do not have an exact date but it is on target. It is fairly imminent. \n Deputy Ruairí Ó Murchú  Who will lead on it? \n An Ceann Comhairle  Please, Deputy Ó Murchú. \n The Taoiseach  The Minister, Deputy Foley, will lead, with the support of the unit in my office, but she will also report to the Cabinet subcommittee, which will then make recommendations to the Cabinet. That is how this will work. The Cabinet subcommittee is very important because all the key Ministers have to be there.  I agree with Deputy Cian O'Callaghan that the unemployment levels among the disability community is too high, and the barriers are too much. Part of the strategy in terms of what I am trying to do with the Minister, Deputy Calleary, is to remove some of those barriers and to create additional supports to make sure that employers are even more incentivised to recruit people. The intention is also to give supports to those who employ people with disabilities on a more sustainable basis. I do not disagree with the Deputy. The historic underemployment of people with disabilities in society is something that is exercising me.  I will pursue the issue raised by Deputy Heneghan about the two autism classes in the Educate Together school in Baldoyle.  I agree with Deputy Boyd Barrett. That is a very strange response from the council referring to the prevalence of autism. Autism is a spectrum, a continuum. There is high-functioning autism, people in the middle and those with autism which is very severe and profound. The council should be able to use the general guidelines in respect of health needs more generally. I am at a loss as to why the council cannot say in this case that the child needs prioritisation and a proper house to facilitate the treatment and life of the child. That is something on which I will go back to the Minister for housing in respect of guidelines to be sent to councils in that respect. I would not have thought it necessary. I thought councils would have enough flexibility to do this.  I disagree with Deputy Paul Murphy's description of the budget as a savage attack, but €3 billion has been invested in special education as an outcome of the budget, as well as €130 million for grants to adapt the houses of older people and disabled people. There was a €10 increase per week in the disability allowance, an expansion of the wage subsidy scheme, an increase of €375 in the income limit for carer's benefit, and a €20 increase in the monthly domiciliary care allowance. That is not a savage attack on disability. We have to pursue the cost of disability and the Minister will bring plans in the next budget in respect of that.  In response to Deputy Tóibín, the vacancy rate nationally has come down for CDNTs. We have increased the allocation of therapy places in third level colleges. \n An Ceann Comhairle  I thank the Taoiseach. Even though there is time left, the point is that this format is not working. The place to discuss that is at the Business Committee on Thursday. I ask Members to bring it up and we can sort out something else. Certainly, where there is a grouping of 19 Members, it is not possible to give the Taoiseach time to answer in the remaining time. I am sorry for those who did not get in but there is just nothing we can do, other than discuss it at the Business Committee and change the format. ",

Deputy Liam Quaide asked the Minister for Social Protection whether a person on certified sick leave will still meet the qualification criteria for carer’s benefit that they must have been employed or self-employed for at least eight weeks in the previous 26-weeks for a minimum of 16 hours each week or 32 hours a fortnight if they previously met this criteria before being on sick leave; and if he will make a statement on the matter. [66403/25] ",
        "answerText": " Minister for Social Protection  The main income supports to family carers provided by my Department are Carer’s Allowance, Carer’s Benefit, Domiciliary Care Allowance and the Carer’s Support Grant. Spending on these payments is estimated at over €2.2 billion in 2026.  Carer's Benefit is available to people who leave the workforce or reduce their working hours to care for a child or an adult in need of full-time care and attention. It is payable for a period of two years for each care recipient and may be claimed over separate periods up to a total of two years.  A person may qualify for Carer’s Benefit if they meet the PRSI and other conditions of the scheme and have been engaged in full-time employment for at least eight weeks in the previous 26 weeks. Full-time employment in this context is defined as engaged insurable employment for at least 16 hours per week or 32 hours per fortnight. This condition does not need to be satisfied on a second or subsequent claim where a person was in receipt of Carer's Benefit within the previous 26 weeks.  The legislation governing Carer’s Benefit outlines the circumstances by which a carer on leave from employment may satisfy the conditions of engagement in full-time employment as an employed contributor. Specifically, the condition is deemed to have been satisfied where the person was on adoptive leave, health and safety leave, maternity leave, parental leave, parent’s leave or paternity leave, having been engaged in remunerative full-time employment as an employed contributor for 8 weeks, whether consecutive or not, within the relevant period. Periods of statutory sick leave are not covered by these provisions.  Where a full-time carer is not eligible for Carer’s Benefit, they may apply for the means-tested Carer’s Allowance and the annual Carer’s Support Grant.  I trust that this clarifies the position for the Deputy. ",

This is a complex undertaking, and will be carried out in a number of phases. A first phase of public consultation was undertaken in 2024.  Many aspects of wildlife legislation are being examined as part of this project. A key focus of the initial phase of the legislation update will be on strengthening the enforcement of wildlife crime and on addressing legislative anomalies. In relation to the Wildlife Acts, it is anticipated that two new Wildlife Bills will be published arising from this work. I expect to finalise and submit the general scheme of the first Bill to Government for approval in the first half of 2026. ",

        "answerText": " Minister for Education and Youth  The Teaching Council registers teachers under the Teaching Council Act 2001-2015 and in line with the Teaching Council Registration Regulations, 2025. (www.teachingcouncil.ie/assets/uploads/2025/10/SI.2025.0482_TC_Registration_Regulations.pdf) As set out in the Schedule to the Regulations, the Council registers teachers under five routes of registration: Route 1 - Primary, Route 2 - Post-primary, Route 3 - Further Education, Route 4 - Other and Route 5 - Student Teacher. The qualification requirements for each route are set down in the Schedule to the Regulations.   The Teaching Council is the regulator of the teaching profession in Ireland. Its role is to protect the public by promoting and regulating professional standards in teaching. This is discharged through the statutory registration of teachers, ensuring a highly qualified teaching profession, whose members meet and uphold high standards of professional competence and conduct. The department has no role in the registration of individual teachers.  As a statutory professional standards body, the Teaching Council is required by law to properly determine and to authenticate the relevant standards and qualifications of all applicants for registration. One of the ways the Council ensures and regulates standards is by ensuring that all teachers entering the profession in the Republic of Ireland have met the required standards.  The qualification requirements as set out for Route 1- Primary are that a person holds either:  • recognised Bachelor of Education (B.Ed.) degree in Primary Education  Or  • holds both:  • A recognised initial primary teacher education qualification and  • A primary degree at Level 8 or a qualification at Level 9 on the National Framework of Qualifications which has a credit weighting of at least 180 ECTS credits.  To assist with teacher supply challenges, in the Teaching Council’s recently revised Registration Regulations, 2025, which were effected on 16 October 2025, a mechanism has been created which provides for teachers who completed a teacher education qualification in another country, but have not completed any mandated induction or post-qualification employment period there, to apply for registration and complete Droichead (induction) here in the Republic of Ireland. Specific eligibility and qualification requirements apply to this mechanism, and it is open for applications until 30 December 2027.  The regulations for routes of registration and qualifications are a matter for the Teaching Council under the Teaching Council Act 2001-2015. The department determines the school sectors and settings where those routes of registrations apply, as outlined in Terms and Conditions circulars.  An appropriately accredited and recognised teaching qualification obtained in Ireland is currently eligible for registration, subject to the usual Teaching Council procedures. There is no mechanism whereby non-accredited or recoginsed domestic qualifications can be facilitated, as the transparent and equal application of published regulations, criteria and procedures in the state to all applicants for registration are important legal principles.  The institute referred to by the Deputy in this query, is a private provider offering various programmes, and the department does not have any role in the courses they deliver, or any other higher education institutions.  While it is acknowledged that acute shortages exist in some schools, and sectors, and locations, the vast majority of allocated posts are filled, the number of registered teachers has increased significantly in recent years. It should be noted that there has been an increase of 20% in teachers graduating in Ireland between 2018 and 2023 from accredited and recognised programmes, and an over 30% increase in the number of teachers registered with the Teaching Council since 2017 with 126,000 on the register this year.

        "answerText": " Minister for Education and Youth  The purpose of the Climate Action Summer Works Scheme (CASWS) is to enable individual school authorities to undertake small-scale building works on a devolved basis that, ideally, can be carried out during the summer months or at other times that avoid disrupting the operation of the school. The CASWS operates on a multi-annual basis across a number of categories of works.  It is envisaged that approvals in any given year will involve a spread of categories rather than the traditional single category at a time. This is aimed at managing market capacity and maximising value for money opportunities for school authorities.  The CASWS will operate on a multi-annual basis. In November 2025 the Minister announced the first tranche of approvals under the new Climate Action Summer Works Scheme. 297 projects were approved to proceed and involve primary, post primary and special schools, along with projects in all counties and across all categories of works. The investment in the first tranche of applications is in the region of €90m.  Given that funding is limited in any particular year it is necessary to prioritise applications. Under the new climate action summer works scheme which operates on a multi annual basis, like previous summer works schemes, applications from schools, including Ballygiblin National School, that are not reached for funding or market prioritisation reasons in 2026 will qualify to be assessed for purposes of the funding available for climate action summer works in subsequent years.  Full details of the of the announcement and the list of schools approved in the first tranche, the Circular (0029/2025) for the scheme and guidance documents for schools can be found at the below link;  www.gov.ie/en/department-of-education/services/summer-works-scheme/  It remains open to a school to apply for funding under the Department's emergency works scheme. The purpose of the Emergency Works Scheme (EWS) is to provide funding specifically for unforeseen emergencies, or to provide funding to facilitate inclusion and access for pupils with special needs. It does so by ensuring the availability of funding for urgent works to those schools that are in need of resources as a result of an emergency situation.  An emergency is deemed to be a situation which poses an immediate risk to health, life, property or the environment, which is sudden, unforeseen and requires immediate action, and in the case of a school, if not corrected would prevent the school or part thereof from opening.  The EWS operates on the basis of a minimal scope works to address the emergency situation. ",
