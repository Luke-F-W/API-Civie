        "answerText": " Minister for Housing, Planning and Local Government  In July 2019, my Department launched the multi-annual Developer-Provided Water Services Infrastructure Resolution Programme 2019-2021. Bids were sought from local authorities for funding under the programme and nineteen local authorities with Developer-Provided Water Services Infrastructure in estates in their areas made applications for funding. Kildare County Council included the estate referred to in its application.  My Department has completed a preliminary evaluation and clarification process on the bids received from the local authorities. An Expert Panel, which includes Departmental, stakeholder and independent representation, has been appointed to examine the bids. The Panel has held a number of meetings to date.  I expect that the Expert Panel will make recommendations to me shortly on the suitability of projects for funding under the programme. This will be based on criteria set out in the Framework document issued to local authorities when requesting proposals. It is expected that an announcement on approvals and allocations will be made once that process is concluded in the coming weeks. ",

        "answerText": " Minister for Education and Skills  My Department published details of Summer Provision 2020 – Reconnecting with Education including a programme for children with complex special educational needs.  The programme is a significant expansion on the July Provision programme of previous years with the eligibility criteria widened to include approximately 9,000 additional primary aged children with complex needs.  The programme aims to ensure, in so far as possible, that these children can reintegrate/transition into their planned education setting for the next school year with their peers.  In-school or home-based supports by teachers and SNAs will help to prevent regression among children with complex special educational needs.  The eligibility criteria includes the following categories of children:  1. Pupils with a diagnosis of Autism  2. Pupils with severe and profound learning difficulties  3. Any child in special school or a special class in a Primary School  4. Children transitioning into a special class or special school from early year’s settings  5. Pupils in primary school mainstream classes who present with the following disabilities:  - Children with Down syndrome  - Children who are Deaf or most severe hard of hearing  - Children who are blind or have a most severe visual impairment  - Children who have a moderate general learning disability  - Children with severe emotional behavioural difficulties  A child must meet at least one of the eligibility criteria.  If a Parent is in doubt about their child’s eligibility, they should consult their child’s school or contact my Department. Contact details are available on my Departments website https://www.education.ie/en/Parents/Services/summerprovision/summer-education-programme-2020.html  Full information on summer provision and its various strands, including guidance information for parents, is available at Gov.ie/summerprovision  In relation to support for preschool children the Department of Children and Youth Affairs launched a dedicated campaign and website to support transition called “Lets Get Ready” which has received a positive response so far.  This resource has been prepared jointly with my Department. It is universal in scope, and is aimed at children returning to preschool as well as children returning to or transitioning to school.  Information on the site is at a level for all to understand and include a section called ‘Ready for Everyone’ to specifically support transitions for children with special / additional needs.  The website, which is being updated and reviewed by the DCYA based on the feedback from various sources, is available at https://www.gov.ie/en/publication/74b0d-ready-for-everyone  ",

        "answerText": " Minister for Education and Skills  This Department provides a book grant to all recognised primary and post primary schools within the Free Education Scheme in order to provide assistance for books including Book Rental Schemes. Under this scheme, the Department provided funding of €16.9 million in 2019 to all of these schools.  Additional funding of €1million which is being allocated to 102 Primary DEIS schools for a new pilot programme for the 2020/21 school year.   The aim of this pilot is to provide free school books for students in the schools involved, and to support these schools in eliminating the cost of school books for parents. Under Circular 46/2013, DEIS schools receive a book grant of €21 per student.  This pilot will provide an additional €64 per student to increase the overall book grant rate to €85 per student enrolled in the school.  This additional funding issued to schools in May 2020.  A range of supports and guidance have also been provided for schools to assist schools in providing for the education for children with special educational needs during the school closure period.  Supports are provided to schools and teachers engaged in distance learning and these are available at www.education.ie/en/covid-19/#14.  In additional to the general guidance that has been provided for schools, additional support material has also been provided specifically on how schools should provide for the continuity of education for children with special educational needs. This guidance is available at:   www.education.ie/en/Schools-Colleges/Information/National-Emergencies-Public-Health-Issues/guidance-continuity-of-schooling-supporting-pupils-with-sen-primary.pdf.    www.education.ie/en/Schools-Colleges/Information/National-Emergencies-Public-Health-Issues/guidance-continuity-of-schooling-supporting-students-with-sen-post-primary.pdf.   The guidance notes that there is a particular need for pupils with special educational needs (SEN) to have regular, ongoing schooling. While all pupils need to be supported to maintain their engagement in learning, those with SEN are among those who need most support at this time. Examples of strategies and measures to ensure that the needs of pupils with SEN are catered for, are provided in the guidance documents and a range of resources are also identified for parents.  It sets out the role of schools and teachers in engaging with pupils with SEN and the role of teachers and school leaders to support such pupils. It advises schools as to how best to keep in touch with parents and guardians and how to keep pupils with SEN safe and engaged in the distance learning environment.  The guidance sets out the role of the special education teacher to support children with special educational needs at this time. It notes that the special education teacher’s knowledge of their pupils’ priority learning needs and agreed targets, as outlined in the pupil support file, will enable them to work with parents and guardians to choose appropriate supports in a remote learning environment.  Special Education Teachers (SETs) are asked to carefully examine how progress on the existing learning targets in student support plans can be reasonably extended by home learning. They are asked to use this knowledge to communicate with the pupils and their parents and guardians and to establish what methods will work best to achieve continuity of learning for the pupils.  The National Council for Special Education (NCSE) is also providing a range of online resources for parents and teachers to support home learning for children with special educational needs during the Covid 19 restrictions.  In addition to the normal supports, the NCSE is providing online resources for children with Special Educational Needs who are at home as a result of the schools’ closure.  Supports provided include those relating to general learning and difficulties for pupils with SEN, Curriculum support, speech language and communication, occupational therapy support, guidance around behaviour, and learning and resources on ‘Visiting Teachers Support’ for a teacher who teaches children with sensory impairment  Details of the full range of supports that the NCSE provides for teachers and parents is available at:   https://ncse.ie/online-resources.   The Department of Education and Skills’ NEPS psychologists have also developed advice and resources for young people to manage and stay well when schools are closed. The NEPS advice & resources for keeping children and young people well during Covid-19 are available at https://www.education.ie/covid19/wellbeing/.   Guidelines for continued provision of Guidance Counselling and resources available to support practice is available at www.education.ie/en/Schools-Colleges/Information/Post-Primary-School-Policies/Policies/Guidance-Plan.html.  Guidance for parents of primary school pupils, which sets out what they should expect in relation to engagement in distance learning from schools, and how they can support their child in a home schooling environment is also available at:  www.education.ie/en/Schools-Colleges/Information/continuity-of-schooling/continuity-of-schooling.html .  I also recently announced that a special €10 million fund is being made available to support the purchase of technology and devices for disadvantaged students, including students with special educational needs.  This is additional to the latest round of funding for ICT under the Digital Strategy for Schools whereby €40m grant funding will be distributed in the coming weeks to eligible. €10m additional funding is also now issuing to schools to support children and young people who are at risk of educational disadvantage during the period of school closures.  While recognising the difficulty that school closure has had for parents and pupils, particularly in relation to pupils with special educational needs, my Department will continue to support and encourage schools to provide as much continuity of education as possible for such pupils, while continuing to engage with public health officials and stakeholders in relation to when schools may re-open and operate in a safe manner that is consistent with public health advice.  Pending the wider re opeing of schools, my Department also published on 12th June, 2020, details of a summer programme for children with special educational needs enrolled in special schools, special classes and mainstream classes.  The programme incorporates some aspects of the July Provision of previous years.  Summer Provision 2020 – Reconnecting with Education, is a significantly expanded programme for children with complex special educational needs which aims to re-establish the child’s relationships and connection with school and their peers as a basis for learning and participation and to help the child to re-engage in learning and social activities and help them adapt to new routines and changes.  The programme aims to ensure, in so far as possible, that the child can reintegrate/transition into their planned education setting for the next school year with their peers.  In-school or home-based supports by teachers and SNAs will help to prevent regression among children with special needs.  The eligibility criteria has been widened to include the following categories of children:  Pupils with a diagnosis of Autism  Pupils with severe and profound learning difficulties  Any child in a special class or special school  Children transitioning into a special class from early year’s settings  Pupils in primary school mainstream classes who present with the following disabilities:  Children with Down syndrome  Children who are Deaf or most severe hard of hearing  Children who are blind or have a most severe visual impairment  Children who have a moderate general learning disability  Children with severe emotional behavioural difficulties  All special schools and primary schools with special classes are invited to provide the school based summer provision for their students.  This programme will run for a minimum of two weeks and can extend up to four weeks where the schools, teachers and Special Needs Assistants are willing to participate.  Home-based provision will be available where a child’s local school is not providing a programme or does not have the capacity to accommodate a child in a planned programme this year. In this situation my Department will provide grant funding towards the engagement by Parents of a registered teacher / SNA to provide home based support for 10 hours a week for 4 weeks.  The programme will be reliant on schools, teachers and Special Needs Assistants (SNAs) choosing to participate on a voluntary basis.  A dedicated online registration system for families of children with special needs to access Summer Provision is now available on Gov.ie/summerprovision.  Parents are asked to register their participation online, providing some outline information of the extent of their participation in the programme e.g. number of weeks.  Once registered, the parent is then free to plan and organise the programme for their child by consulting with the child’s school and securing the services of a teacher or SNA.  Full information on the scheme and its various strands, including guidance information for parents, is available at Gov.ie/summerprovision. ",

        "answerText": " Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport  My Department has liaised with other Government departments and industry representative bodies, to align the economy wide COVID-19 supports and initiatives with tourism and hospitality needs.  The measures put in place by the Government to support businesses were initially focused on supporting those who have lost their jobs and in supporting businesses to remain viable during this difficult time with specifically targeted supports to assist companies to stay operational and retain their staff.  As a result, many tourism businesses are now availing of the various cross-sectoral economic supports that the Government has already put in place such as; the wage subsidy scheme, increased unemployment benefits, the state credit guarantee scheme, working capital loan schemes, enterprise support schemes and deferrals of tax liabilities, VAT, social contributions and local authority rates.  Government will continue to explore funding potential for all enterprises including tourism businesses as they work through the challenges facing them, including through any mechanisms allowable through the EU’s state aid framework.  Fáilte Ireland has set up a COVID-19 Industry Advisory Group which meets weekly. The purpose of this group is to provide support to the tourism industry and to facilitate the timely sharing of information and insights to help improve the sector's understanding and response to the crisis. Fáilte Ireland has also developed a COVID-19 Business Support Hub which offers a suite of targeted supports for tourism businesses including a series of webinars from experts in each field, as well as advice guides with detailed FAQs and templates where necessary.  Fáilte Ireland unveiled its new national domestic marketing campaign, ‘Ireland, make a break for it’, to the tourism and hospitality industry last week and it has since gone live across all media this weekend. This is a major drive to encourage people to take domestic breaks this summer. They have also launched a new COVID-19 Safety Charter initiative designed to boost public confidence in the safety of businesses as the tourism sector reopens from 29th June.  To assist tourism businesses reopening in line with the Government’s Roadmap for Reopening Society and Business, Fáilte Ireland published guidelines for the tourism sector, prepared in consultation with the tourism industry and relevant authorities.  These guidelines are intended to assist tourism businesses meet requirements in line with the Return to Work Safely protocol and based on the latest health advice.  As the Deputy is aware, the Tourism Recovery Taskforce was established on 20th May 2020. The purpose of the Taskforce is to prepare a Tourism Recovery Plan which will include a set of recommendations on how best the Irish tourism sector can adapt and recover in the changed tourism environment as a result of the Covid-19 crisis. A dedicated page has been set up on the Gov.ie website which gives regular updates on the status of the Tourism Recovery Taskforce and includes minutes from meetings and documention relating to the work of the Taskforce. The Taskforce presented an initial report last week which will inform Government thinking on the recovery in the sector. ",

It has been agreed to move from 2 metres social distancing on public transport to 50% capacity. This will help to underpin public transport during these unprecedented times for the sector, with a view to safeguarding public transport capacity in Phases 3 and 4 of the of the Roadmap for Reopening Society and Business. The Government also decided to legally require the mandatory wearing of face coverings on public transport, with the exception of those who cannot do so for health reasons or due to age (under 13). These measures will protect both passengers and staff and significantly help ease the pressure on operators by reducing the gap between public transport supply and demand.  Further, on the 25th of June Government agreed new temporary funding supports, in accordance with EU and national legislation, will be introduced for the licensed bus sector. Licensed operators provide essential transport services for people who need to get to work and are vital to ensure economic recovery. These supports are aimed at ensuring the continued operation of essential licensed bus services for a period of up to six months. The package will be restricted to operators where a clear public interest justification supports such intervention and will be targeted at compensating the gap between specified costs and revenues generated on the services. The National Transport Authority (NTA), as the public transport licensing agency, will administer the support package through the establishment of contracts between the NTA and the relevant operators.  Furthermore, the Government previously introduced a €12bn package of supports for impacted businesses of all sizes, which include: the wage subsidy scheme, the pandemic unemployment payment for the self-employed, grants, low-cost loans, write-off of commercial rates and deferred tax liabilities, all of which will help to improve cashflow amongst SMEs.

This programme is for capital purposes only however, and has never provided current funding for operational costs associated with these pools.  Sport Ireland, which is the statutory body for the development of sport, supports a network of Local Sports Partnerships (LSPs) throughout the country. My Department, through Sport Ireland, supports LSPs as a model for collaboration between Sport Ireland and the local authorities with the purpose of delivering sports and physical activity programmes in local facilities, including local authority sport centres.  The additional funding package for the sport sector announced on 19 June includes a Sports Restart and Renewal Fund of up to €5m. A proportion of this funding, which will be administered and disbursed by Sport Ireland, will be channelled to the network of  LSPs for new programmes at a local level over the coming months. While funding at local level may be provided to swimming programmes, funding will not be provided to swimming pool operators. This is a matter for the pool owners, including local authorities.

In recent months a substantial and wide range of financial supports and guidance to help businesses impacted by the Covid 19 crisis have been put in place. Details of these are available on the Department of Business, Enterprise and Innovation website at the following link https://dbei.gov.ie/en/What-We-Do/Supports-for-SMEs/COVID-19-supports/ ",

Two waves of the survey have been published so far and the results for Wave 3 of the survey are being published this week.  The results from the first wave of the survey, published on 1 May, estimated that 54% of businesses had turnover at least 10% below normal in quarter one, while 36.2% had turnover close to normal expectation, and 9.8% had higher than normal turnover. When asked about their expectation for quarter two, three quarters of businesses expected their turnover to be at least 10% lower than normal in the second quarter, 18.6% expected turnover to be close to normal, and only 6.6% expected turnover to be higher than normal in quarter two.  Because of the sample size and design of the survey, and in particular the inability of some businesses to respond, these figures should be considered as indicative rather than definitive estimates of the impact on turnover so far.

Micro-enterprises accounted for a total turnover of €123.9 billion in 2017 and small enterprises had turnover of €107.7 billion.  The Business Impact of COVID-19 Survey was introduced by the CSO to measure and report quickly on the key features of how the COVID-19 crisis has affected business in Ireland. Two waves of the survey have been published so far and the results for the third wave of the survey are being published this week.  The results published so far include some indicative estimates of the impact on turnover. The first wave of the survey found that more than 60% of micro-enterprises had seen turnover fall by more than 10% in quarter one, while 35.7% had turnover close to normal expectations. Only 3.1% of micro-enterprises replied that their turnover was above normal expectations in quarter one. When asked what they expected for quarter two, more than three quarters of micro-enterprises expected turnover in quarter two to be at least 10% lower than normal, while 20.2% expected turnover close to normal expectations, and 3.1% expected turnover in quarter two to be above normal expectations.  For small enterprises, the survey found that 55.9% had seen turnover fall by more than 10% in quarter one, while 31.3% had turnover at or close to normal expectations, and 12.8% of small enterprises replied that turnover in quarter one was above normal expectations. More than three quarters of small enterprises projected turnover to be 10% or more below normal expectations in quarter two, while 14.8% expected turnover to be close to normal expectations, and 9.1% expected quarter two turnover to be above normal expectations.  The first two waves of the survey did not ask questions about changes in wages or costs. The third wave, which is being published this week, includes a question on the change in personnel and non-personnel operating costs. The figures from the survey should be considered as indicative rather than definitive estimates, because of the sample size and design of the survey, and in particular the inability of some businesses to respond.

[12324/20] ",
        "answerText": " Minister for Finance  As the Deputy is aware there is an unprecedented level of uncertainty around the outlook for the Irish economy currently. The macro-financial outlook is inextricably linked to the pandemic, and the ultimate outcome will be determined to a significant degree by the effectiveness of the public health measures and the extent to which medical advances can diminish or eliminate the virus.  Currently the level of losses that will be experienced on loans to local companies is not possible to estimate as the public health crisis continues to evolve. Companies have needed, and will continue to require access to liquidity and, in some cases, solvency support to reduce the risk that the productive capacity of the economy is permanently damaged.  In this regard I have introduced a series of measures and supports to help businesses including the Temporary Wage Subsidy Scheme (TWSS) and the proposed ‘warehousing’ of certain COVID-19 related tax debts to support businesses immediate cash flow challenges.  Furthermore, together with my colleagues the Minister for Business, Enterprise and Innovation, Ms Heather Humphreys and the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Marine, Mr Michael Creed, Government announced a package of measures aimed at supporting businesses and farmers of varying sizes and with varying needs including the provision of grants and loans, in relation to, working capital, longer-term finance and business advisory supports. A comprehensive list of these measures can be found at: https://www.gov.ie/en/service/63d47e-government-supports-for-covid-19-impacted-businesses/  Banks’ loan losses will be mitigated to some extent by the Government supports that have been provided to firms. I also welcome the role that the domestic banking system has played in supporting liquidity needs of households and businesses so far in this crisis, including through payment breaks.  COVID-19 will put pressure on banks’ financial position, but improved resilience, supported by recent policy actions, results in a banking system that is now better able to absorb, rather than amplify, such a shock. The Central Bank of Ireland and the European Single Supervisory Mechanism have built up, and now released, capital requirements on banks in response to the COVID-19 shock, which will allow banks to absorb potential loan losses, as well as reducing the risk of a drop in credit supply. The Irish domestic banks do not possess limitless capacity to support the economy and the absorb losses that will inevitably stem from the COVID-19 crisis. The degree to which is dependent on the severity and duration of the economic shock, which is itself is dependent health situation and societal restrictions.  I can assure the Deputy that I will continue to work with my Department, the Central Bank, other Government Departments and their agencies to maintain financial stability and a robust economy. ",

Deputy Martin Heydon asked the Minister for Business, Enterprise and Innovation the assessment of the level of out-of-pocket losses incurred to date by microbusinesses, small businesses and medium businesses, respectively, as a result of the Covid-19 crisis; and if she will make a statement on the matter. [12323/20] ",
        "answerText": " Minister for Business, Enterprise and Innovation  The Government recognises the issue of ‘out of pocket’ costs which businesses have to pay despite not being able to trade. However, it would not be practical to conduct an assessment of the level of these costs for the range of businesses the Deputy outlines in his question.  Whilst for many businesses these costs will include rents, rates, insurance costs and wage costs, the levels of these costs incurred will vary significantly depending on the sector in which the business is engaged, the extent to which negotiations can take place with service providers, the size of premises, the number of staff and the geographical location of the business.  The Government is committed to ensuring as many businesses as possible survive this challenging period, and in recognition of these costs and the many other challenges faced by businesses during this crisis, Government has introduced a suite of supports to assist businesses.  The €250m Restart Grant provides direct support to micro and small businesses and aims to reduce any potential debt overhang for businesses resuming activity and assist with re-opening costs. Complementing this is the commercial rate waiver which will waive rates for businesses forced to close as a result of public health directives. The Temporary Wage Subsidy Scheme has provided a vital source of funds to support up to 85% of employment costs for firms affected by the pandemic and Revenue’s decision to allow businesses to defer tax liabilities have injected large amounts of liquidity into many businesses of all sizes right across the country.  In addition to these direct supports, my Department has a range of other supports which are open to businesses right across the country, full details on all supports are available at: https://dbei.gov.ie/en/What-We-Do/Supports-for-SMEs/COVID-19-supports/ ",

        "answerText": " Minister for Finance  As Minister for Finance, I have no statutory function in relation to the banking decisions made by individual lending institutions as these are taken by the board and management of the relevant institution. However, as the Deputy may be aware given the current COVID-19 crisis on 18 March I met with the Chief Executives of the five major retail banks and the Banking and Payments Federation of Ireland (BPFI). The banks have assured me that they are working to ensure a wide range of credit, cash flow and supply chain supports are offered to businesses who are trying to manage the pressures arising from COVID-19.  Further to this, An Taoiseach, Leo Varadkar T.D. and I, along with the Minister for Business, Enterprise & Innovation, Heather Humphreys T.D., met with the Chief Executives of the five Irish major retail banks on 11 May. The Taoiseach emphasised the important role of the banking sector in supporting the gradual re-opening of the Irish economy by ensuring a flow of credit to businesses as they begin to trade again, in line with the government’s Roadmap for Re-opening Society and Business.  We welcomed the ongoing work of the banks in helping business customers and mortgage customers impacted by COVID-19, which included the initial three month payment-breaks that allowed households and businesses to defer some of their most significant outgoings. On 30 April the members of the Banking and Payments Federation Ireland (BPFI) announced their intention to extend these payment breaks to six months for households and businesses which require it.  The Central Bank is focused on ensuring that extensions to COVID-19 related payment breaks operate in borrowers’ best interests and in line with regulatory requirements.  Payment breaks give customers the opportunity to postpone or reduce their repayments on their mortgage, personal or business loans, providing breathing space for borrowers from the severe income shock many households and businesses are experiencing.  The main concern of the Government currently is to ensure that SMEs have access to sufficient liquidity, and that access to credit for SMEs is maintained. The Government has announced a range of measures to assist companies deal with the consequences of the COVID-19 restrictions, and to ensure that they have access to sufficient liquidity, including loan schemes to assist SMEs.  On 2 May I announced a €2 billion Credit Guarantee Scheme to support COVID-19 affected business. This guarantee will give the participating lenders a high level of comfort and help them to continue to lend to SMEs that will be viable after this crisis passes but need access to credit during this difficult time.

Supporting the promotion and sustainability of our SMEs has always been a high priority of mine. The current crisis reminds us of the importance of this objective amid the challenging circumstances which have been thrust upon our small business sector by the COVID-19 pandemic.  In order to assist businesses to address the challenges posed by COVID-19, the Government has put in place a comprehensive suite of supports which can be accessed by firms of all sizes, and across all industries, including those in the events industry, which includes the wage subsidy scheme, grants, low-cost loans, write-off of commercial rates and deferred tax liabilities. These supports are designed to build confidence, to further assist businesses in terms of the management of their companies and to allow them to begin looking to the future and start charting a path forward for the weeks and months ahead. For a full list of supports for business please see my Department's website at www.dbei.gov.ie .  In addition, my Department is currently operating a Business Support Call Centre to advise on the Government supports available to businesses and enterprises that are affected by COVID-19.

The Deputy will also be aware that my colleague, the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, has responsibility for initiatives specific to the tourism sector and events and festivals, which of course is of significant importance to the events industry. In addition, the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport has established a Tourism Recovery Taskforce to examine bespoke supports for that sector. ",

Deputy Martin Heydon asked the Minister for Business, Enterprise and Innovation the analysis carried out to determine the level of supports that will be needed in the coming months for small and medium businesses; and if she will make a statement on the matter. [11512/20] ",
        "answerText": " Minister for Business, Enterprise and Innovation  I can assure the Deputy I am continually reviewing the range of supports needed by SMEs and micro enterprises in particular as the Covid-19 crisis evolves. The economic analysis undertaken by my Department has highlighted the challenges for SMEs arising from COVID-19 which have been immediate and heavily impactful on certain sectors. As highlighted in my two published reports, Economic Considerations for Reinstating Economic Activity Phase 1 and Phase 2, GDP is projected to decline by over 10% in 2020. The heightened risk of a hard Brexit at the end of 2020 could exacerbate the difficulties facing the economy and recovery prospects.  SMEs across all sectors are being impacted, with for example the Accommodation and Food sector continuing to be the hardest hit so far with over 90% of those in employment now receiving either the Pandemic Unemployment Payment (PUP) or the Temporary Wage Subsidy Scheme (TWSS). The Wholesale and Retail sector, despite large elements continuing to trade, has some 58% of employees either on the PUP or TWSS. Personal services, construction and administrative and support services have also been heavily impacted. The manufacturing sector, FDI and globally traded sectors have had less severe impacts to date. However, it is too early yet to assess the impact on global trade and, given the important of these sectors, we will continue to monitor and keep under close review.  The impact of COVID-19 on the public finances has been significant with the total value of measures introduced to date (including expenditure and liquidity) standing at over €13 billion. Around 40% of those previously in employment are still on COVID-19 related income support payments.  In responding to the challenges presented by the COVID-19 crisis, I and my Department has been actively engaged across all sectors and working closely with other government departments and a wide range of stakeholders in recent months. I chair the Enterprise Forum which comprises the main SME representative bodies including ISME, Small Firms Association and Chambers Ireland and will continue to review what new initiatives are required.  I have tailored and developed a suite of supports to help businesses impacted by COVID-19 and minimise the extent of the economic damage caused by the pandemic. I have worked collectively with my Offices, Agencies and other government bodies to achieve maximum impact. This comprehensive suite of supports involves a mix of grants, vouchers, low-cost loans and credit guarantees, all of which, when combined with other supports, such as write-off of commercial rates, wage subsidies and deferred tax liabilities, will help to improve cash flow for businesses and help them to restart, reconnect and rehire staff. The details of all schemes are set out in our Guide to Supports for Businesses, which is available on our website.  I have also developed and put in place extensive information supports from an early stage in my Department. On 13th March I established a dedicated COVID-19 Business Call Centre to assist SMEs with information on the various new and existing schemes and financial supports available.  A new team, drawn from across the Department, was set up with a dedicated helpline phone number and email address. The team, all working remotely has now dealt with in excess of 5,000 calls to date across a wide range of issues. This Unit is also dealing with COVID-19 related representations and, in the week ending 5th June, have received a total of 803 reps, with 764 finalised. At an early stage, we also wrote to 230,000 companies advising them of the range of business supports on offer to assist firms in their COVID-19 response. We also published extensive information in our Guide to Supports for Businesses. This is a living document detailing the range of COVID-19 business supports and other Government supports available and we will continue to update the guide as we introduce new measures. ",

        "showAs": " 460. Deputy Martin Heydon asked the Minister for Business, Enterprise and Innovation her plans for further supports for small and medium-sized businesses facing challenges in the months ahead; and if she will make a statement on the matter. [11514/20] ",
        "answerText": " Minister for Business, Enterprise and Innovation  In order to assist businesses to address the challenges posed by COVID-19, the Government has put in place a comprehensive suite of supports for firms of all sizes, which includes the wage subsidy scheme, grants, low-cost loans, write-off of commercial rates and deferred tax liabilities.  These supports are designed to build confidence, to further assist businesses in terms of the management of their companies and to allow them to begin looking to the future and start charting a path forward for weeks and months ahead. For a full list of supports for business please see https://dbei.gov.ie/en/What-We-Do/Supports-for-SMEs/COVID-19-supports/ .  The full range of Enterprise Ireland, Local Enterprise Office (LEO) and Údarás na Gaeltachta grant and advisory supports continue to be available to eligible firms to help with strategies to access finance, commence or ramp-up online trading activity, reconfigure business models, cut costs, innovate, diversify markets and supply chains and to improve competitiveness.  In that regard, Government will continue to examine additional measures needed for all enterprises, SMEs and micro-enterprises as they work through the challenges facing them, including through any additional mechanisms allowable through the EU’s state aid framework.  In terms of forthcoming schemes for SMEs, I would highlight in particular that the Government has agreed a new €2 billion COVID-19 Credit Guarantee Scheme as a further development of the existing Credit Guarantee Scheme already available from AIB, BOI and Ulster Bank. This Scheme forms a major component of the government’s strategy to aid SMEs in these difficult times by providing critical support to ensure businesses are facilitated in having access to credit facilities to assist a return to a more regular trading environment. It will provide an 80% guarantee on lending to SMEs until the end of this year, for terms between 3 months and 6 years. The guarantee will be able to be used for a wide range of lending products between €10,000 and €1 million that have a maximum term of 6 years or less.  The Scheme will be available to all SME sectors, including primary producers. It will also have interest rates below current market rates. The implementation of this Scheme will require primary legislation, the drafting of which has been approved by Government, and my officials are working with the Office of the Parliamentary counsel on this drafting work.  Work is also under way to extend existing schemes in place to support access to finance for businesses to ensure that they can continue to offer support to businesses as they look towards reopening. These include the Covid-19 Working Capital Scheme and the Future Growth Loan Scheme.  The Covid-19 Working Capital Scheme makes lending available to eligible businesses that have been negatively impacted by issues arising from the outbreak of Covid-19 in Ireland as they seek to innovate, change or adapt in response to this disruption. Loans under this scheme are for up to three years and range from €25,000 up to €1.5 million (first €500,000 unsecured) with a maximum interest rate of 4%.  Future Growth Loan Scheme provides long term loans of 8-10 years to businesses at low interest rates. There has been significant demand for the scheme and the initial funding has been almost fully subscribed. This expansion will further support the needs of SMEs, including primary producers, impacted by COVID-19. This new funding will be released in tranches. The long-term nature of these loans is particularly important for businesses as they plan for recovery. Work is under way to deliver this funding as quickly as possible.  My Department is encouraging any affected business to take advantage of the LEO COVID-19 supports. The situation is still developing from day to day and the Government continues to respond to these developments in an effort to protect and support Irish businesses. The LEOs will continue to work with existing applicants and recipients of Business Continuity Vouchers (BCV) and their subsequent business continuity plans. The awarding of vouchers under the BCV scheme will naturally taper off in the coming weeks as the Local Enterprise Offices process the outstanding applications.  InterTradeIreland launched two new business supports, these are currently being targeted at companies who are already on one of their programs. E-merge enables companies to engage consultancy support & advice (to the value of £2,500/€2,800) to help them develop online sales & ecommerce solutions.  Emergency Business Solutions: Fully funded consultancy support & advice (to the value of £2000/€2250) to address key business challenges in areas such as emergency cashflow, loan applications and HR/People.  As the Deputy is aware the COVID-19 pandemic has fundamentally changed the Irish and global economy. COVID-19 has emerged as a sudden and profound disruptor. Both globally and nationally, it is unclear how deep the impact will be or how long it will last. The COVID-19 pandemic is presenting significant challenges for SMEs, the impact of which varies by sector and region. Following a strong 2019 performance, companies focused on internationalisation and growth at the start of 2020 are facing new, and unplanned for, challenges.  My Department working with its agencies are continually reviewing the situation and I am informed that Enterprise Ireland is working with SMEs client companies to support the stabilisation of their business so that they can undertake a developmental programme focused on recovery and growth. To support companies the agency has:  - Developed and launched a suite of new funding supports utilising the additional flexibility permitted under Ireland’s Sustaining Enterprise Scheme supporting undertakings affected by the economic repercussions of the COVID-19 outbreak under the Temporary Framework for State Aid Measure to Support the Economy in the Current COVID-19 Outbreak.  - Set up a Business Response Hub to provide information to companies on what supports are available to assist with their specific needs. To date the agency has supported many companies through the Hub.  - As a first step, SMEs need to stabilise their business with key elements including business planning and accessing liquidity. Once a company has a financial and business continuity plan, Enterprise Ireland can provide funding for companies who have been impacted by COVID- 19, either through a reduction in turnover/profit or a significant increase in costs. The purpose of this funding is to enable the company to stabilise and implement a business sustainment plan, leading to a return to viability and contributing to the recovery of the Irish economy. New supports introduced to support this include:  Planning Supports  - Lean Business Continuity Support: This €2.5k grant supports companies to access training or advisory services related to crisis management, sustaining operations, moving to e-business/online and planning for resilience post crisis. Reflecting the practical and immediate nature of this support, company interest and demand has been strong.  - COVID-19 Business Financial Planning Grant: This grant of up to €5k provides 100 per cent funding for companies to access a financial consultant to prepare a financial plan to assist companies:  - understand their immediate financial position, secure the finance required to survive and provide a framework to sustain the business; and  - ensure they have a framework to identify and manage costs and gaps in funding.  - This is a critical support for a company to strengthen their position to identify funding needs and access required funding to implement their business plan.  - Liquidity Support  - Sustaining Enterprise Fund: The agency’s liquidity and medium-term financial supports are being delivered under the Sustaining Enterprise Fund. Support of up to €800,000 can be provided to companies, with different levels of support and funding instruments available, which are targeted at companies at different stages of development and growth (e.g. established companies, start-ups and small enterprises).  - The agency is actively working with companies to prepare applications for funding under the Sustaining Enterprise Fund.  In addition to the immediate COVID-19 response, Enterprise Ireland continues to strongly focus on supporting companies to invest in innovation, competitiveness and market diversification. These activities are critical to underpinning the long-term development and growth of Irish enterprise. As part of this, the agency:  - Is utilising its client engagement model to work with client companies on a one-to-one basis to establish company need and will tailor a support package utilising the full suite of supports offered by the agency.  - Is delivering non-financial supports, such as the market intelligence, available via the agency’s global network of 40 offices. This provides valuable insight for companies on markets which will be vital in informing a company’s internationalisation strategy.  Indigenous Irish companies are the backbone of the economy and I can assure the Deputy that the officials in my Department are working with all our agencies to monitor the needs of sectors and companies and provide new supports to meet changing company needs, as required.  The Restart Grant provides direct grant aid to micro and small businesses. The grant is a contribution towards the cost of re-opening or keeping a business operational and re-connecting with employees and customers. Funding in respect to the Restart Grant is provided by my Department and is administered by the 31 Local Authorities.  Enterprise Ireland, working with my Department will continue to monitor the needs of sectors and companies as the situation evolves and provide new supports to meet changing company needs, as required. Indigenous Irish companies are the backbone of the economy and the agency is committed to helping these companies sustain their businesses.  I can assure the Deputy that I continue to work with my colleagues across Government to examine further appropriate supports to assist businesses impacted by Covid-19 and will continue to keep the supports provided for enterprise under review.

        "answerText": " Minister of State at the Department of Health (Finian McGrath)  As part of the overall effort to contain the spread of COVID-19 and in line with public health advice, day service locations have been closed since March. However priority service users have been identified in each CHO, and individualised supports continue to be provided to many people in alternative models particularly for these individuals with higher support needs, through alternative means such as via online support and/or regular telephone contact with families. Health and social care responses to the current public health emergency are under continuing review, including specific measures such as these to support vulnerable people.  The resumption of adult day services is currently being considered by my Department and the HSE as part of broader planning to prepare for the resumption of non-COVID-19 community and social care services in the current environment, and in line with public health guidance. My Department and the HSE has established a Joint Working Group to develop a plan for Community Capacity.  The HSE is finalising plans to re-establish vital non-covid supports and services. This includes very careful and detailed work on the part of the Disability Sector with national guidance and will result in directing how all funded agencies can deliver services on a medium to long-term basis. Community Healthcare Organisations and Section 38/39 agencies continue to work together at a regional level in order to plan and co-ordinate efforts. Considering the very serious nature of this pandemic and the vulnerability of people with disabilities as a care group, any plans to safely commence all disability services and supports must comply with guidance developed by the National Public Surveillance Centre  in the HSE.  The HSE has now developed a number of important guidance documents to assist disability services: the Framework for Resumption of Adult Day Services and Reshaping Disability Services From 2020 & Beyond. The HSE and disability service providers, where identified, will continue to communicate with school leavers and their families to plan and organise for a transition to day services in line with public health guidance.  These documents are available at the website linked below.  https://www.hse.ie/eng/services/news/newsfeatures/covid19-updates/partner-resources/ ",

The terms and conditions, for this scheme are available on the Defence Forces website, military.ie.  The scheme will allow for initial re-enlistment for a minimum of six months and up to 3 years. The duration of the re-enlistment offered will be dependent on the vacancies that exist. I can confirm that this scheme currently remains open for application.  The re-enlistment of former personnel with the relevant skills and experience was one of the many actions being pursued to address the skill shortages in the PDF. It is a medium to long term initiative which pre-dates the COVID crisis, but which also facilitates the COVID response.  Under the terms and conditions, individuals who wish to re-enlist will serve for a specific period and for a specific purpose which will involve the use of a particular skill or area of expertise which cannot currently be met through the use of existing military resources. In addition, those who re-enlist will do so at the rank and salary point on which they left and will be required to meet a range of general eligibility criteria, including medical and physical fitness to ensure they are capable of performing normal military duties.  Since the announcement of the Scheme, I am delighted to report that over 600 applications have been received, with some 500 having gone forward for further assessment by the Chief of Staff.

Under the Safety, Health and Welfare at Work (Construction) Regulations 2013, construction workers in Ireland are legally bound to hold a valid Safe Pass Registration Card to access construction site. The Minister for Business, Enterprise and Innovation recently amended these regulations to extend the validity of Safe Pass cards with an expiration date after the 1st March 2020 until SOLAS Safe Pass training has restarted.  SOLAS has examined the potential for online delivery as a means of continuing national construction health and safety courses while adhering to public health measures. I am advised that no immediate solution has been identified that is equitable with the existing Safe Pass course delivery model, in being accessible to all eligible workers, provides real time course participants supports (literacy and numeracy) and interpreter services, as well as ensuring assessment integrity. As the training authority, SOLAS does not have the authority to issue temporary Safe Pass cards in the absence of associated education and training.  In terms of the delivery of face to face training, planning is well advanced to support delivery of Safe Pass training within health and social distancing guidelines once public health considerations provide for the return to training for this cohort of learners. The inclusion of the resumption of Safe Pass training in Phase 2 of the Government’s Roadmap is under consideration at the current time, particularly in the context of the adverse effect of non-availability of the training on safe access to construction sites for workers and on employment opportunities in the sector.

        "answerText": " Minister for Education and Skills  Following the school closure in March 2020, my Department published a range of guidance to assist schools and teachers in ensuring continuity of teaching and learning for students as well as supporting their wellbeing during the COVID-19 pandemic.  This guidance aimed, inter alia, to ensure regular engagement of students in lessons, tasks and learning experiences across the range of curriculum subjects, provision of regular assignments and regular, practical, supportive and customised feedback on work submitted.  Schools adopted various ways to engage with their students in accordance with the technology and broadband resources available in school and at home, including by post, e-mails, communication apps, the school website, use of other digital communicative platforms, including live meetings. Schools were asked to be conscious of pupils who may not have access to online facilities and to adapt approaches so that these pupils continued to have the opportunity to participate in learning.  The aim of these distant learning approaches, the guidance which issued to all schools and the regular engagement with students, was to ensure that students stayed connected with and progressed their learning.  These actions will, therefore, have helped to minimise the impact of school closure.  In the context of planning for a return to school which is underway, my Department is, inter alia, considering the curriculum, i.e. what needs to be put in place to support ongoing progression for learners and addressing any shortfall that may result from school closures.  Those going into sixth year in post primary schools are a group that will receive a particular focus in the context of preparations for the Leaving Certificate examinations in 2021.  My Department is acutely aware of the challenges faced by students at this difficult time, and how the current circumstances  will continue to present challenges into the future. The welfare of students is, and will continue to be, front and centre in all decision making. ",

        "answerText": " Minister for Education and Skills  On the 1st May 2020, the Taoiseach announced as part of the \"Roadmap for Reopening Society and Business\" that schools will commence opening on a phased basis at the beginning of the 2020/2021 academic year.  My Department is currently working with the Education Partners and relevant stakeholders in planning for this re-opening which will be based on public health advice. As part of this engagement, each of the education partners were given the opportunity to outline the key issues that they would like to have considered in the context of re-opening schools.  The issues raised by the education partners will now be worked through in detail as part of the development of the roadmap for reopening schools.  A core objective will be to ensure that schools and other education settings can re-open and operate in a safe manner that is consistent with public health advice.  In the interim, my Department has provided a range of support and guidance for schools on how to provide for the continuing education for pupils over the current school closure period.  Supports are provided to schools and teachers engaged in distance learning and these are available at https://www.education.ie/en/covid-19/#14   In addition to the general guidance that has been provided for schools, additional support material has also been provided specifically on how schools should provide for the continuity of education for children with special educational needs. This guidance is available at:   https://www.education.ie/en/Schools-Colleges/Information/National-Emergencies-Public-Health-Issues/guidance-continuity-of-schooling-supporting-pupils-with-sen-primary.pdf    https://www.education.ie/en/Schools-Colleges/Information/National-Emergencies-Public-Health-Issues/guidance-continuity-of-schooling-supporting-students-with-sen-post-primary.pdf   The guidance notes that there is a particular need for pupils with special educational needs (SEN) to have regular, ongoing schooling. While all pupils need to be supported to maintain their engagement in learning, those with SEN are among those who need most support at this time. Examples of strategies and measures to ensure that the needs of pupils with SEN are catered for, are provided in the guidance documents and a range of resources are also identified for parents.  It sets out the role of schools and teachers in engaging with pupils with SEN and the role of teachers and school leaders to support such pupils. It advises schools as to how best to keep in touch with parents and guardians and how to keep pupils with SEN safe and engaged in the distance learning environment.  The guidance sets out the role of the special education teacher to support children with special educational needs at this time. It notes that the special education teacher’s knowledge of their pupils’ priority learning needs and agreed targets, as outlined in the pupil support file, will enable them to work with parents and guardians to choose appropriate supports in a remote learning environment.  Special Education Teachers (SETs) are asked to carefully examine how progress on the existing learning targets in student support plans can be reasonably extended by home learning. They are asked to use this knowledge to communicate with the pupils and their parents and guardians and to establish what methods will work best to achieve continuity of learning for the pupils.  The National Council for Special Education (NCSE) is also providing a range of online resources for parents and teachers to support home learning for children with special educational needs during the Covid 19 restrictions.  In addition to the normal supports, the NCSE is providing online resources for children with Special Educational Needs who are at home as a result of the schools’ closure.  Supports provided include those relating to general learning and difficulties for pupils with SEN, Curriculum support, speech language and communication, occupational therapy support, guidance around behaviour, and learning and resources on ‘Visiting Teachers Support’ for a teacher who teaches children with sensory impairment  Details of the full range of supports that the NCSE provides for teachers and parents is available at:   https://ncse.ie/online-resources   The Department of Education and Skills’ NEPS psychologists have also developed advice and resources for young people to manage and stay well when schools are closed. The NEPS advice & resources for keeping children and young people well during Covid-19 are available at https://www.education.ie/covid19/wellbeing/  Guidelines for continued provision of Guidance Counselling and resources available to support practice is available at https://www.education.ie/en/Schools-Colleges/Information/Post-Primary-School-Policies/Policies/Guidance-Plan.html  Guidance for parents of primary school pupils, which sets out what they should expect in relation to engagement in distance learning from schools, and how they can support their child in a home schooling environment is also available at:   https://www.education.ie/en/Schools-Colleges/Information/continuity-of-schooling/continuity-of-schooling.html   I also recently announced that a special €10 million fund is being made available to support the purchase of technology and devices for disadvantaged students, including students with special educational needs.  This is additional to the latest round of funding for ICT under the Digital Strategy for Schools whereby €40m grant funding will be distributed in the coming weeks to eligible. €10m additional funding is also now issuing to schools to support children and young people who are at risk of educational disadvantage during the period of school closures.  While recognising the difficulty that school closure has had for parents and pupils, particularly in relation to pupils with special educational needs, my Department will continue to support and encourage schools to provide as much continuity of education as possible for such pupils, while continuing to engage with public health officials and stakeholders in relation to when schools may re-open and operate in a safe manner that is consistent with public health advice.  My Department is also planning for a summer provision type programme for children with complex needs this year as soon as it is safe to do so and in accordance with public health advice.  The primary aim of the proposed programme would be to limit potential regression in learning thereby ensuring in so far as possible that these children can reintegrate and transition into their planned education setting for next year with their peers.  This may be done through a targeted level of supports to address regression of social skills and re-establish tolerance of routines paving the way for reintegrating full time into education when schools reopen in the autumn.  Planning is underway and consultations with stakeholders have commenced. The willingness of schools, teachers and SNAs to participate are key to the provision of a summer education programme.  An announcement will be made as soon as possible. ",

The BCPs in identified public places will leverage the high speed broadband connection through a range of measures and initiatives, for example providing free public Wi-Fi, some will also have hot-desks, and some will be digital hub business centres where digital training, business information events and other SME supports are organised.

        "answerText": " Minister for Children and Youth Affairs (Katherine Zappone)  The Deputy is aware that the Covid-19 pandemic has resulted in an unprecedented situation that has required a series of emergency responses from the Government and my Department.  My Department and I are engaging extensively with stakeholders in the Early Learning and Care (ELC) and School-Age (SAC) sector.  Consultation with stakeholders has always been central to the work of my Department, and the Early Years Forum (EY Forum) is a key part of this.  The EY Forum meets several times a year and includes representatives of providers, parents and academics with an interest in the ELC and SAC sector.  I established the ‘EY Forum Plus’ in March 2020 to widen representation by the sector, to aid my Department in developing a response to Covid-19.  This group has met on a number of occasions over the past three months.  I recently established an Advisory Group and a Reference Group on the phased re-opening of ELC and SAC services on 29 June 2020. The Advisory Group had its first meeting on 13 May and has met 4 times since. A separate Reference Group representing other stakeholders had its first meeting on 28 May.  With regard to supports that are currently available to ELC and SAC providers to allow them to open in line with the Government’s Roadmap for the Reopening of Society and Business, I was delighted to note, in a report to Government last week, the HPSC Guidance for settings providing childcare during the COVID-19 pandemic. This is an extremely valuable resource for all childcare providers and indeed for parents making decisions about returning their children to childcare. I am very grateful to the HSE and HPSC for their time and expertise in developing this resource and for their collaboration with my officials.  In terms of financial supports that will be available, the Programme Support Payment (PSP) for the 2019/20 programme year will issue in June. This payment totals €13m (an additional €6m was already issued in April) and acknowledges the administrative workload on providers delivering my Department’s subsidy payments to almost 200,000 children every year.  The Deputy will be aware that the Capital Programme for 2020 was suspended in March, due to the Covid-19 pandemic. I now plan to launch a revised capital programme in June that will seek to support services with COVID related challenges.  Under this new capital grant programme, funds will be made available to services to enable them to carry out preparatory work in advance of opening.  The application process, which will be administered by Pobal, will go live in the coming days. The application process will be user-friendly and simple to use.  Providers will receive confirmation of the funding they are to receive before they reopen.  I am continuing to work with my officials, members of the Advisory Group and colleagues across Government on a range of other supports and I will be happy to update the Deputy  further when these are more advanced.

[7956/20] ",
        "answerText": " Minister of State at the Department of Defence  On 1 April last, I announced a scheme to re-enlist former enlisted personnel who have the skills and expertise required to fill identified gaps in the Permanent Defence Force. The terms and conditions, for this scheme were developed in consultation with the Representative Association, PDFORRA, and are available on the Defence Forces website, military.ie . The scheme will allow for initial re-enlistment for a minimum of six months and up to 3 years.  The re-enlistment of former personnel with the relevant skills and experience was one of the many actions being pursued to address the skill shortages in the PDF. It is a medium to long term initiative which pre-dates the COVID crisis, but which also facilitates the COVID response.  Under the terms and conditions, individuals who wish to re-enlist will serve for a specific period and for a specific purpose which will involve the use of a particular skill or area of expertise which cannot currently be met through the use of existing military resources. In addition, individuals will be required to meet a range of general eligibility criteria including medical and physical fitness to ensure they are capable of performing normal military duties.  I wish to confirm that, as provided for in the terms and conditions for the scheme, anyone who leaves of their own volition during the period of their enlistment of up to three years will not  be required to make any payment in order to discharge. They may, however, incur a specific undertaking for any training provided during that period. ",

        "answerText": " Minister of State at the Department of Defence  Some €216.2m (excluding VAT) is currently committed to the acquisition of six new aircraft to be provided to the Air Corps.  My priority as Minister with Responsibility for Defence is to ensure that the operational capability of the Defence Forces is maintained to the greatest extent possible so as to enable the Defence Forces to carry out their roles as assigned by Government. Capability equipment requirements are kept under on-going review in the light of present and expected operational needs.  The White Paper on Defence provides for the replacement of the current Air Corps Cessna fleet with three larger aircraft which will be equipped for Intelligence, Surveillance, Target Acquisition and Reconnaissance (ISTAR). Following an open tender competition, a contract was placed with Pilatus Aircraft Ltd in December 2017 at a cost of some €32m plus VAT for the provision of three PC-12 fixed wing utility aircraft suitably equipped for ISTAR tasks which will replace the Cessna FR 172H fleet. The contract is well underway and it is expected that the three aircraft will be delivered in 2020.  In March 2020, an additional Pilatus PC-12 NG aircraft was acquired at a cost of €4.2m plus VAT. This aircraft provides the Air Corps with immediate additional fixed wing capacity to meet the unique situation arising from the COVID-19 pandemic.  The Deputy may wish to note that the White Paper also provides for the replacement of the two CASA 235 Maritime Patrol Aircraft with consideration of their replacement with larger more capable aircraft, which would enhance maritime surveillance and provide a greater degree of utility for transport and cargo carrying tasks. Following a tender competition a contract was awarded to Airbus Defence and Space in December 2019 for delivery of two C295 Maritime Patrol Aircraft in 2023 at a cost of some €180 plus VAT.  In accordance with the National Development Plan, the capital allocation for Defence has been increased to €113 million for 2020, an increase of €7 million on the 2019 NDP allocation. The NDP provides for a total of €541 million over the period 2018 to 2022. This level of capital funding will allow the Defence Organisation to continue the programme of sustained equipment replacement and infrastructural development across the Army, Air Corps and Naval Service as identified and prioritised in the Defence White Paper and builds on the significant investment programme over recent years. The replacement of the Air Corps Cessna aircraft and the CASA 235 Maritime Patrol Aircraft are among the projects included for funding. ",

        "answerText": " Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade  With the commencement of the COVID-19 public health emergency and the introduction of widespread travel restrictions both nationally and internationally, Irish citizens have ceased nearly all non-essential travel. This has led to a large decrease in the number of passport applications received by the Passport Service, including a decrease in applications received from applicants.  In response to this situation, the Passport Service is operating an essential, emergency service at this time. This has allowed us to both reassign staff to our consular services assisting our citizens abroad and redeploy staff to critical areas including contact tracing for the HSE and COVID-19 payments for Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection, all critical services at this time.  The Passport Service continues to process emergency passports for our citizens at home and abroad. Almost 350 passports have issued to our citizens both at home and abroad in response to urgent requests. Our webchat service and a dedicated travel emergency mailbox continue to operate through which we can be contacted in such circumstances. In addition, our phones lines have answered over 16,000 calls from Irish citizens overseas as part of the Department’s response to the COVID-19 crisis.  The Passport Service staff cannot work remotely, they must be on site in order to process passport applications. This is to protect the personal data of the applicant and the integrity of the Irish Passport System.  The Global Irish Services Division of the Department is now focused on returning to a point when we can provide a full passport service. We will endeavour to do so as quickly as possible, while providing our staff with a safe working environment and in line with the Government’s Roadmap to reopen Ireland’s economy and society. The protection of staff is our first priority but we also recognise that providing passports is an essential public service. I encourage Deputies to stay in contact with my office for updates in relation to the Passport Service. ",

Deputy Martin Heydon asked the Minister for Finance if adjustments will be considered to the wage subsidy scheme to allow those returning from maternity leave to be included; if not, if alternative financial supports can be provided; and if he will make a statement on the matter. [8148/20] ",
        "answerText": " Minister for Finance  I propose to take Questions Nos. 38, 39, 43, 51, 56, 70, 79 and 86 together.  The Temporary Wage Subsidy Scheme (TWSS) is a temporary emergency measure to deal with the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic on the economy, intended to maximise staff retention and firm viability by maintaining the link between the employer and employee insofar as is possible through this truly exceptional period. In that regard, it is noted that, as of 25 May, almost 56,300 employers and over 482,800 employees have thus far benefited from the measure.  It ultimately gives a sum to employers to cover a portion of their wage bill in circumstances where the employer’s business has been negatively impacted by the restrictions that have had to be introduced to stop the spread of the COVID-19 virus. The sum the employer receives is based on the employees who were on their payroll on 29 February 2020, the net salary such employees received in January and February 2020, as well as the extent to which the employer remains able to continue to discharge their legal obligation to pay their employees’ salaries.  The TWSS is built upon historic PAYE returns made to Revenue. One of the core principles of the scheme that is necessary to prevent abuse is the requirement that the employees for which a claim is submitted must be on the payroll of the employer as at 29 February 2020. Thus, where an individual commenced a new employment after 29 February 2020, or returned to the payroll of his or her employer after that date following a period of unpaid leave, whether maternity related or otherwise, that salary cannot be included in the calculation of the sum that is available to the employer under the TWSS.  The 29 February payroll decision has consequences for many groups, however, the scheme is being administered in a manner that is fully compliant with all relevant legislation and no discriminatory treatment of workers arises.  Further, the position in relation to the TWSS does not affect any legal obligations that the employer may have to their employee as regards any terms, conditions or entitlements of their employment, including pay. The question of an individual’s employment entitlements following their resumption of work after a period of leave, and the question of what wages an employer may or may not be in a position to pay such an employee are matters between the employee and the employer – and the entire period of pregnancy and maternity leave is a special protected period under the law.  It is understood that although the employer may not be able to claim the TWSS for a person who has not been on the payroll on 29 February but is entitled to return to work after this date, they remain obliged to honour their obligations as an employer as the full suite of employment rights legislation continues to apply in relation to all employees and their employers for the duration of the COVID-19 crisis and beyond.  As regards the operation of the TWSS, I am aware of the matter that has been raised by the Deputies and I have instructed officials to re-examine whether such workers may be accommodated at this time within the scheme.

The project in question is at Stage 1 of architectural planning which entails preliminary design of site and location suitability and initial sketch scheme.  A review in 2019 of the demand for post primary provision in the area resulted in an increase in the schedule of accommodation to cater for up to 1,300 pupils. The Department met with the school and the increase was accepted by the school. Agreement was also obtained from the school patron on a reservation of space on the school site for future educational development.  Initially, it had been anticipated that this project would be delivered in the form of an extension and refurbishment. However, through ongoing engagement with the school, its Board of Management and Trustees (CEIST), the option of a New Build is currently being explored by the Department.  The Design Team has been instructed to provide an initial sketch scheme for a 1300 pupil school, and submit to the Department for review.  Following this review my Department will then be in contact with the Board of Management of the school with regard to the progression of the project. ",

On 5 April, 2020, the United Nations Secretary General directed the suspension of all rotations and leave for military personnel serving in United Nations (UN) missions until 30 June, effective immediately.  The UN directed that only in certain very limited and extenuating circumstances would any exemption be allowed, and only where a rotation was vital to maintain a critical operational capability and where the requisite quarantine requirements for incoming and rotating contingents required by the UN and the host state can also be guaranteed.  Any such exemption was subject to a decision by the UN Headquarters in New York on a proposal from the Force Commander.  The UN direction impacted over 100,000 UN uniformed personnel from over 120 countries serving world-wide, including Ireland and Defence Forces personnel serving with UN missions. The suspension was based on the protection of local communities as well as that of the peacekeepers during the Covid pandemic.  Immediately upon the direction of the UN Secretary General, the Defence Forces, the Department of Defence and the Department Foreign Affairs and Trade engaged with the UN in the mission areas and at UN Headquarters, though both informal and formal contacts to ensure that the rotation of Irish personnel would be achieved as close as possible to the scheduled dates.  On foot of these efforts, rotations to UNDOF, MINUSMA, KFOR and EUTM Mali have been successfully concluded to date.  However, from the outset, the key focus has been on UNIFIL.  As our largest mission, it involves the rotation of a significant number of personnel in two stages, two weeks apart and is thus more complex, and requires approvals and permissions from both the UN and from the Host State, not least in terms of their health status and that of the local population in a time of a global pandemic health restrictions.  The UN has agreed to a partial exemption of the suspension for Ireland. This flexibility from the UN resulted from the immediate and coordinated case advanced at mission level, by the Chief of Staff and at UN Headquarters, by the Department of Defence and the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade.  Given the size of the contingent and the requirements of the mission, the UNIFIL rotations take place in two stages, (commonly known as “chalks”).  I am advised that the indications at present are that the first chalk will take place in the latter part of June and the second in early July. However, contacts with the UN in New York are continuing.  I am acutely aware of the impact the UN decision is having on Defence Force members, as well as the anxiety that this has caused for families.  In this connection, I am advised by the military authorities that personnel in mission areas are being briefed as information comes to hand.  Personnel and families will continue to be advised and updated by the Defence Forces as further information becomes available.

        "answerText": " Minister for Finance  The legislation underpinning the Temporary Wage Subsidy Scheme (TWSS) is contained in Section 28 of the Emergency Measures in the Public Interest (Covid-19) Act 2020. Of necessity, the legislation and the scheme itself were developed very quickly to support the urgent Government objective of getting much needed assistance to employers and employees that have been seriously affected by the pandemic.  The TWSS builds on data returned to Revenue through its real-time PAYE system. The self-employed are not taxed under the PAYE system. It must be accepted that the underlying legislation and the scheme itself simply cannot be tailored to meet every individual unique set of circumstances.  The TWSS in its current form allows the concentration of resources to protect incomes, in a proportionate way having regard to available resources, employer contribution and the broader suite of COVID-19 related supports put in place by the Government.  As you are aware, the Government has announced a range of measures designed to support businesses during the COVID-19 crisis, details of which are available at: www.gov.ie/en/publication/fe8f00-government-outlines-further-measures-to-support-businesses-impacted-/.

        "answerText": " Minister for Education and Skills  The project referred to by the Deputy has been devolved to the National Development Finance Agency (NDFA) for delivery as part of a programme of school building projects.  The NDFA is currently undertaking the second phase of the process of appointment of multi-disciplinary technical advisors (design teams) for these projects. This process will involve a number of call-off competitions for bundles of projects from a framework.  Thereafter, the NDFA will ensure that the project progresses to design stage, obtains the necessary statutory planning permission, and moves the project onward to tender and construction in due course. As the project is at an early stage in the delivery process, it is not possible at this time to give a date for its completion.  Please be assured that the NDFA will be engaging directly with the school authority to keep it informed of progress. ",
