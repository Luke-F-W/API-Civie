        "answerText": " Deputy Barry Ward  My question is about the provision of offshore wind energy and initiatives his Department might have put in place to fast-track that, particularly in the context of dealing with the frustrations of people who recognise that, as I understand it, there is currently no operating offshore wind capacity in Ireland. \n Deputy Timmy Dooley  The Deputy is right in what he said. The lack of capacity is due to the phasing out of the facility on the Arklow Bank. The Deputy will be familiar with the announcement recently about the Tonn Nua site, which is just off the south-east coast. That announcement was very positive in the sense that an auction system was deployed. We had four bidders and we got a very good price at less than €100 per MW hour. There have been a number of auctions in other countries that have effectively failed because there were no bidders. We are on the right path  The plan-led development through the use of the designated marine area plan, DMAP, is a critical part of the Government's strategic plan for our maritime area. This is reflected by the commitment stated in the programme for Government to fast-track offshore wind development by prioritising the publication of the DMAPs. There is a plan in place, which I am shepherding through at the minute. It is a national DMAP. We hope to have it concluded by the end of 2027.  Three additional sites have been identified in the south-east coast DMAP. Tonn Nua has gone to auction. It has been announced that there are three other opportunities there, and they will be advanced in a timely way. There are some real issues to be resolved in terms of how that might pan out. Then, by 2027, we hope to have a national DMAP that will identify enough sites to get us to our 2040 target of an additional 15 GW of electricity. That is progressing with pace. In addition to that, we want to identify at least one but potentially two sites suitable for floating offshore wind, which really has great potential from an Irish perspective in the sense that it would give us the capacity to generate enormous amounts of electricity that might potentially be used for export, through interconnection or with some of the imaginative projects which the ESB and others are involved in, looking at converting to hydrogen or ammonia as a methodology of storing the energy. \n Deputy Barry Ward  I do recognise that some progress has been made but I know from speaking to people around the country that there is a real frustration at the lack of speed of decision-making. If a decision is made today to start a process to establish a wind farm offshore, whether that is implanted into the seabed or floating, we are many years away from the realisation of that plan. Honestly, people do not understand why that should be the case. It should not take that long. I recognise what the Government has put forward in terms of an infrastructure plan that it is going to shorten those times but in terms of what the Minister's Department is doing, what specifically are we doing to make sure that these things can happen faster? In particular, the Minister State said there have been no bidders. Has the Department examined why that is the case and identified why it is that the many international companies that are operating in this field feel it is not worth their while bidding for projects off the coast of Ireland? If it does not have bidders, what are we doing about that? Is there some other State instrument that can step in to fill that place or is there something we need to change in the terms of that auction? \n Deputy Timmy Dooley  To the Deputy's last point, we are fortunate that due to the way in which our auctions are designed, we have attracted significant bidders. Four is particularly good. There were instances in the UK, Denmark and Germany where there were no bidders because they had moved away from the contract for difference component of the auction. We are, therefore, in a very healthy position. What we have done in recent years is move towards the plan-led approach. Prior to that, it was basically that developers identified sites and came forward. The planning process was somewhat slower at that time and they ran into some complications. There are a number of them out there - about five - that we want to progress and are progressing through the planning phases. They will be very significant contributors to our generation. However, the plan-led approach that is there now is working. The example I have given the Deputy of the Tonn Nua site off the south-east coast in terms of the design of the auction has worked really well, and there is interest. We are regularly in contact with potential bidders to ensure they understand what the Government strategy is. What they want is certainty. They want to know that the country is committed to offshore, which we are, and that there is a pipeline of projects. We have set a plan in place now for that timeline. \n Deputy Barry Ward  I welcome the fact the Minister is reiterating the State's commitment to offshore because as an offshore island, essentially, this has huge potential for us. I think of the projects even in my own constituency or off the coast of my constituency in the case of the Codling Wind Park and Dublin Array projects. They are hugely important projects but the level of investment from RWE or the contracting companies there is enormous before they ever get off the ground. That has to be a disincentive in real terms for companies that actually want to invest in our infrastructure, provide us with clean energy and help us to get to a point where we are actually a net energy exporter. That is really important.  I appreciate what the Minister said but I ask him to redouble his efforts in terms of specifically addressing the delays issues. I recognise what the plan is in terms of judicial reviews and establishing a local standard for judicial reviews; a person cannot be living in County Donegal and object to one off Rosses Point or something like that. That is really important. Let us make it easy for people to do it, and the easiest way to do it is to make it quicker. \n Deputy Timmy Dooley  I fully support what the Deputy is saying. The projects he referred to are projects that have been there. They are referred to as the phase 1 projects. They were in existence prior to the State intervening to resolve the issue by having a plan-led approach and setting out a clearer pathway for companies to progress their ambitions. Of course, we are working with those companies also to ensure that those projects, which, as I said, are phase 1 and somewhat legacy to the system that is there now, are progressed and progressed quickly.  There is work under way too with the Maritime Area Regulatory Authority, MARA, to ensure the appropriate permissions are progressed. There is the potential for some changes there that will expedite those projects. However, the plan-led approach is giving a very clear direction of travel in terms of the commitment to offshore energy generation and a commitment to ensure there is a pipeline into the future towards 2040, with real targets and a recognition by the State that it will have to stand behind those projects through the contract for difference approach that has been successful and is attractive to bring that investment to the country.

        "answerText": " Minister for Climate, Energy and the Environment  The provision of connection agreements for customers of ESB Networks is an operational matter for ESB Networks. It is not one in which the Minister has any function. The development of electricity grid capacity and the provision of connections for customers are the responsibility of the national Transmission System Operator, EirGrid, and Distribution System Operator, ESB Networks.  These system operators are independent of the Minister in the exercise of their respective functions, and both are overseen by the independent regulator, the Commission for Regulation of Utilities (CRU), which is accountable to a Committee of the Oireachtas.  Ireland, like many other European countries, is experiencing high demand for new electrical connections. This demand is driven by a growing population, the electrification of heat and transport, increased industrial activity, housing targets and large energy users.  To ensure the continued delivery of grid capacity to allow the provision of new connection agreements to customers, including those for electric vehicle infrastructure, the Government is providing both vital investment and coordinated cross-government action.  My Department is in regular engagement with the CRU and system operators to work to develop grid capacity and facilitate customer connections. Our Accelerating Renewable Electricity Taskforce brings together these organisations to focus on identifying key barriers and potential solutions to accelerating the delivery of critical grid infrastructure. This work complements that of the Accelerating Infrastructure Taskforce to deliver connections to enterprise and housing, including those required by electrical vehicle rental companies. ",

        "answerText": " Minister for Climate, Energy and the Environment  I propose to take Questions Nos. 129 and 139 together.  As Minister, I meet with a range of stakeholders on important topics including energy prices. In this regard, I can confirm that I have met with both the Commission for Regulation of Utilities (CRU), which is assigned consumer protection functions under the 1999 Electricity Regulation Act, and energy supply companies since being appointed as Minister.  On 26 September 2025, I met with the four largest energy suppliers in Ireland: Electric Ireland, Bord Gáis, SSE Airtricity, and Energia. In addition to these meetings, my officials meet with suppliers on a regular basis and a key message to them is the critical importance of prices being reduced as soon as possible.  Following my engagement with the energy suppliers, I have received confirmation that hardship funds for those struggling to meet their energy costs will be made available to households this winter. The hardship funds operate in different ways from supplier to supplier. I would, therefore, encourage customers that are experiencing difficulties paying their bills to engage with their suppliers. I would also highlight that customers engaging with their supplier will not be disconnected.  The CRU has also published enhanced customer protection measures for Winter 2025/2026. For the upcoming Winter period, some of the key customer protection measures that will remain in place include a disconnection moratorium for reasons of non-payment, minimum timelines for debt repayment plans, discounted tariffs for financial hardship meter customers, and promotion by energy suppliers of the vulnerable customer register. This is in addition to the existing sources of support, such as the Fuel Allowance, Household Benefits Package and Additional Needs Payment Scheme operated by the Department of Social Protection.  In June of this year, my Department established a National Energy Affordability Taskforce to identify, assess and implement measures that will enhance energy affordability for households and businesses, operating within the broader policy context set by the Programme for Government. The taskforce completed its first report, which included measures for consideration to support customers this Winter, to inform Budget 2026 discussions. The taskforce will now proceed with further work to develop an Energy Affordability Action Plan, including a programme of public consultation and stakeholder engagement. The action plan will be published in 2026. ",

        "answerText": " Tánaiste and Minister for Finance  All liquid fuels, including biofuels such as hydrotreated/hydrogenated vegetable oil (HVO), are subject to Value-Added Tax (VAT), and to excise duty in the form of Mineral Oil Tax (MOT).  The VAT rating of goods and services is subject to EU VAT law, with which Irish VAT law is obliged to comply. In general, the EU VAT Directive provides that all goods and services are liable to VAT at the standard rate unless they fall within Annex III of the Directive, in respect of which Member States may apply a lower rate of VAT.  Motor fuels such as petrol, including bio-ethanol petrol blends, and auto-diesel are not included in the categories of goods and services on which the EU Directive allows a lower rate of VAT, and so they are liable to VAT at the standard rate, currently 23%. Biofuel and non-food vegetable oils, such as HVO, used to fuel vehicles are similarly liable to VAT at the standard rate and Ireland has no discretion in this regard.  Regarding MOT, biofuels which are produced from biomass qualify for relief from the carbon component of MOT under section 100(5) of Finance Act 1999 (as amended). This means that biofuels, such as HVO, bio-ethanol and Fatty Acid Methyl Ester (FAME), are only subject to the non-carbon component of MOT. In the case of blended fuels, the biofuel relief applies to the biofuel portion. I am advised by Revenue that current effective MOT rates on biofuels, along with comparable MOT rates for fossil fuels, such as auto-diesel, are published on Revenue’s website at: www.revenue.ie/en/companies-and-charities/excise-and-licences/mineral-oil-tax/liquid-substitute-fuels/index.aspx  As biofuels are relieved of the carbon component of MOT, they are not impacted by annual carbon tax increases. As a result, the MOT rate differential between biofuels and fossil fuels will continue to widen as the 10-year carbon tax trajectory up to 2030 is implemented. I am advised by Revenue that in 2024 the tax forgone under the MOT biofuel relief for fuels used for propulsion is estimated at approximately €69 million. This estimate is based on an analysis of MOT returns data across all fuel types and a breakdown in respect of specific biofuels, such as HVO, is not available.  The tax treatment of HVO in the freight sector, and possible further incentives for its use, was recently examined in the Department’s Tax Strategy Group paper on Energy, Environmental and Vehicle Tax, which is available on my Department’s website at: www.gov.ie/en/department-of-finance/collections/budget-2026-tax-strategy-group-papers/ ",

        "answerText": " Tánaiste and Minister for Finance  Local Property Tax (LPT) was legislated for in 2012 in the Finance (Local Property Tax) Act 2012. On the introduction of the LPT, the Government decided that a liability to the tax should apply to all owners of residential properties with a limited number of exemptions. Limiting the exemptions available allows the rate to be kept low for those liable persons who do not qualify for an exemption.  The design of LPT was considered by an interdepartmental group chaired by Dr. Don Thornhill. As part of their terms of reference, the group were asked to “ consider the design of a property tax to replace the household charge and that is equitable and is informed by previous work and international experience.”  In considering the equity of a property tax, the report of the group noted that owners of more valuable properties would pay more under a market value-based tax. The report noted this was equitable to the extent that market value provides a measure of the value of a residential property to the owner, particularly in terms of its proximity to places of work and local amenities and facilities.  Furthermore, in 2019, an interdepartmental group also conducted a review of LPT. Their report noted that, when viewed as a capital tax, property tax can be considered progressive since capital tends to be more heavily concentrated in the hands of higher income earners. It also noted that taxes that are based on incomes tend to bring about behavioural change. In contrast, property taxes apply to a base that is largely immovable and broadens the tax base.  Any property owners experiencing difficulties can avail of a wide range of flexible payment options both in respect of their LPT liabilities and for any previous years where liabilities remain outstanding. The full range of payment options, which includes phased arrangements, are available to property owners on the Revenue website at: www.revenue.ie/en/property/local-property-tax/paying-your-lpt/index.aspx  For these reasons, it is my view that a property tax system that is calculated on the basis of property value, with supports in place for those who need assistance, is appropriate and fair.

        "answerText": " Minister of State at the Department of Climate, Energy and the Environment  The forthcoming second Whole of Government Circular Economy Strategy, which was recently subject to a public consultation, makes the business case for the circular economy setting a holistic vision, supporting practices such as eco-design, repair, reuse and remanufacturing. It will provide for incentives that will create a level playing field for circular economy actors, practices and products, and leverage public procurement to create a market for circular products and practices.  Product re-use and repair are the building blocks of a circular economy which can contribute to climate change mitigation by preventing resource depletion, diverting products and materials from landfills and incineration and reducing energy demand. To support this effort the forthcoming Circular Economy Strategy includes a commitment to develop a pilot repair voucher scheme.  The Directive promoting the repair of broken or defective goods, also known as the Right-to-Repair Directive, comes into effect in July, 2026. This will make it easier for consumers to seek repair instead of replacement and repair services will become more accessible, transparent, and attractive. It gives manufacturers the incentive required to make products that last longer and can be repaired, reused, and recycled.  It complements other recent EU legislation to promote sustainable consumption, such as the Eco-design for Sustainable Products Regulation which will promote the production of repairable products and the directive on empowering consumers for the green transition which will enable consumers to make better-informed purchasing decisions at the point of sale.  These important developments will be leveraged to support the development of a more vibrant repair and reuse ecosystem in Ireland. The National Reuse and Repair Network established by the EPA plays a key role in bringing together public bodies and national organisations to facilitate knowledge sharing and engagement to support and scale reuse and repair in Ireland.  Work was commissioned by the EPA to undertake a study to support future development of the national repair directory, repairmystuff.ie. It is intended that this study will provide insights relevant to policymakers, business and other circular economy stakeholders and contribute to national discussions on the role of repair in the circular economy.

Electricity and gas retail markets in Ireland operate within a European regulatory regime, wherein these markets are commercial, liberalised, and competitive. They are overseen by the independent regulator, the Commission for Regulation of Utilities (CRU). Price setting by electricity suppliers, including standing charges, is a commercial and operational matter for the companies concerned.  Each year, the CRU carries out a review of the effectiveness of customer protection measures over the past winter, as well as deciding the measures to be retained for the forthcoming winter.  The CRU customer protection measures were originally developed, in consultation with customer representative groups, in 2022 as a response to Ireland’s energy challenges following the war in Ukraine. Since then, the additional protection measures have been monitored with data and feedback sought by the CRU from a range of stakeholders to fully understand the impact for all customers groups including vulnerable customers.  The CRU has announced measures to remain in place for winter 2025/26 including a disconnection moratorium for all customers, a requirement to automatically place customers with a financial hardship meter on the most economic tariff (e.g. tariffs that might otherwise only be available to new customers/retention offers), and active promotion of the vulnerable customer register.  With regard to measures for Pay As You Go customers, the debt repayment level has been set at 15%. While this amount has increased from the 10% rate set for the last three years, it was ordinarily 25%. It is also important to note that this a maximum repayment rate, and suppliers are free to set this repayment rate at a lower level.  The Government has made a number of important commitments in respect of addressing the continued high cost of energy. The Programme for Government acknowledges the increased energy cost pressures on households and businesses, and Budget 2026 included the introduction of a number of measures to address energy affordability including:  • a €5 per week increase in the Fuel Allowance bringing the payment to €38 per week. This equates to an increase of more than 15% and will provide an additional €140 to over 450,000 recipients during the annual fuel allowance season;  • this payment has also been expanded to include those in receipt of the Working Family Payment;  • Budget 2026 provided record funding of €558 million for the Sustainable Energy of Ireland's residential and community energy upgrade schemes, an increase of €89 million on the Budget 2025 allocation to support delivery of the National Retrofit Plan. Research suggests retrofit measures can save a household up to €1,100 per year in terms of energy; and  • the reduced 9% VAT rate on electricity and gas has been extended until 31 December 2030, to help contain household energy costs.  It is important to note that the Department of Social Protection can also provide support through the Additional Needs Payment to help households meet expenses, including those who face difficulties with fuel bills.  The National Energy Affordability Taskforce is now preparing for an engagement and consultation process to inform the development of an action plan to be published mid-next year. The taskforce will also continue to bring an all of Government approach to researching and assessing options to enhance energy affordability for households and business. ",

They are overseen by the independent regulator, the Commission for Regulation of Utilities (CRU). Price setting by electricity suppliers, including standing charges, is a commercial and operational matter for the companies concerned.  Each year, the CRU carries out a review of the effectiveness of customer protection measures over the past winter, as well as deciding the measures to be retained for the forthcoming winter.  The CRU customer protection measures were originally developed, in consultation with customer representative groups, in 2022 as a response to Ireland’s energy challenges following the war in Ukraine. Since then, the additional protection measures have been monitored with data and feedback sought by the CRU from a range of stakeholders to fully understand the impact for all customers groups including vulnerable customers.  The CRU has announced measures to remain in place for winter 2025/26 including a disconnection moratorium for all customers, a requirement to automatically place customers with a financial hardship meter on the most economic tariff (e.g. tariffs that might otherwise only be available to new customers/retention offers), and active promotion of the vulnerable customer register.  With regard to measures for Pay As You Go customers, the debt repayment level has been set at 15%. While this amount has increased from the 10% rate set for the last three years, it was ordinarily 25%. It is also important to note that this a maximum repayment rate, and suppliers are free to set this repayment rate at a lower level.  The Government has made a number of important commitments in respect of addressing the continued high cost of energy. The Programme for Government acknowledges the increased energy cost pressures on households and businesses, and Budget 2026 included the introduction of a number of measures to address energy affordability including:  • a €5 per week increase in the Fuel Allowance bringing the payment to €38 per week. This equates to an increase of more than 15% and will provide an additional €140 to over 450,000 recipients during the annual fuel allowance season;  • this payment has also been expanded to include those in receipt of the Working Family Payment;  • Budget 2026 provided record funding of €558 million for the Sustainable Energy of Ireland's residential and community energy upgrade schemes, an increase of €89 million on the Budget 2025 allocation to support delivery of the National Retrofit Plan. Research suggests retrofit measures can save a household up to €1,100 per year in terms of energy; and  • the reduced 9% VAT rate on electricity and gas has been extended until 31 December 2030, to help contain household energy costs.  It is important to note that the Department of Social Protection can also provide support through the Additional Needs Payment to help households meet expenses, including those who face difficulties with fuel bills.  The National Energy Affordability Taskforce is now preparing for an engagement and consultation process to inform the development of an action plan to be published mid-next year. The taskforce will also continue to bring an all of Government approach to researching and assessing options to enhance energy affordability for households and business. ",

        "answerText": " Minister of State at the Department of the Taoiseach  CSO trade in goods statistics with non-EU countries such as Israel are compiled using a number of data sources including data sourced from Customs documents, Intrastat survey returns and estimates.  Extra-EU trade statistics are compiled mainly using Customs data sourced from documents (Single Administrative Documents (SADs)) supplied by exporters and importers (or their agents) to the Customs authorities which are used for Customs clearance purposes. The information on the SAD is captured by the Customs AEP (Automated Entry Processing) system, either by feeding it in at the Customs Stations or by electronic transfer direct from the trader. The AEP records, with the statistical data, are transferred to VIMA and then to the Central Statistics Office (CSO) for processing and dissemination.  For import values, Intrastat data with country of consignment as intra-EU but country of origin as Extra-EU are also included in the compilation of trade statistics. CSO data on trade figures records imports by country of origin; that is the country from which the goods originate, rather than the country of consignment which is the last Member State where a change has been made to the goods, for example, where there is a change of ownership of the goods, or goods are repackaged or further processed in some way. If a firm imports goods from country A which have been repackaged in country B for example, the country of origin is country A, but the country of consignment is country B. It should be noted, however, that in the case where the goods simply transit through a Member State, that Member State is not recorded in the trade statistics at all.  In addition, CSO trade statistics include estimates for firms which have not submitted a response to the Intrastat survey, or which are not liable to return a response for the Intrastat data. For Intrastat data, firms whose value of imports exceed the threshold (€750,000) in the previous 12 months must make a detailed import return each month. These estimates are forecast using past historical values. Intrastat data is not used in the compilation of export trade statistics for non-EU countries as export goods are classified by country of final destination.  Countries for trade statistics are classified for all European statistical offices compiling European statistics on international trade in goods using EUROSTAT’s country nomenclature (Geonomenclature) as set out annually in the Official Journal of the European Union. From January 1999, this follows the United Nation’s coding system, where each country is identified by a two-letter code.  CSO trade in goods statistics from non-EU countries such as Israel are thus an aggregation of Customs-based non-EU trade data, Intrastat survey data and estimates for firms which are below threshold or non-response for this survey.  Between January and September 2025, the value of import goods from Israel was €2.6* billion while the value of export goods was €1.0* billion.   *The most recent month’s data on External Trade in Goods figures are provisional and subject to revision.

Under the terms of the Air Navigation (Foreign Military Aircraft) Order, 1952, all foreign military aircraft wishing to overfly, or land in, the State require diplomatic clearance from the Minister for Foreign Affairs.  Diplomatic clearance is only provided where the conditions set out by my Department are fully met, including that the aircraft is unarmed; that it carries no arms, ammunition or explosives; that it does not engage in intelligence gathering; and that the flight in question does not form part of a military exercise or operation. This policy is well known and is fully understood by international partners.  The permission given by Ireland to foreign military or state aircraft to overfly or land in the State is fully compatible with our policy of military neutrality, which, as practised by successive Governments, means that Ireland does not participate in military alliances or common or mutual defence arrangements. As the Government has stated on numerous occasions, there are no plans to alter this policy.  Foreign military aircraft which are given permission to land in Ireland are not subject to inspection in this regard. Sovereign immunity, a long-standing principle of customary international law, means that a state may not exercise its jurisdiction in respect to another state or its property, including state and military aircraft. This principle applies automatically to foreign State or military aircraft in the same way that it applies to Irish State or military aircraft abroad.  In 2025, my Department has granted permission on a small number of occasions for US military aircraft to land in Shannon for the specific purpose of transporting senior officials travelling from the United States to the Middle East.  I am fully satisfied that the stringent procedures for diplomatic clearance were followed in full on each of these occasions, meaning that the aircraft were unarmed; carried no arms, ammunition or explosives; were not engaged in intelligence gathering; and did not form part of a military exercise or operation.

        "answerText": " Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade  I propose to take Questions Nos. 9 to 16, inclusive, together.  Under the terms of the Air Navigation (Foreign Military Aircraft) Order, 1952, all foreign military aircraft wishing to overfly, or land in, the State require diplomatic clearance from the Minister for Foreign Affairs.  Diplomatic clearance is only provided where the conditions set out by my Department are fully met, including that the aircraft is unarmed; that it carries no arms, ammunition or explosives; that it does not engage in intelligence gathering; and that the flight in question does not form part of a military exercise or operation. This policy is well known and is fully understood by international partners.  The permission given by Ireland to foreign military or state aircraft to overfly or land in the State is fully compatible with our policy of military neutrality, which, as practised by successive Governments, means that Ireland does not participate in military alliances or common or mutual defence arrangements. As the Government has stated on numerous occasions, there are no plans to alter this policy.  Foreign military aircraft which are given permission to land in Ireland are not subject to inspection in this regard. Sovereign immunity, a long-standing principle of customary international law, means that a state may not exercise its jurisdiction in respect to another state or its property, including state and military aircraft. This principle applies automatically to foreign State or military aircraft in the same way that it applies to Irish State or military aircraft abroad.  In 2025, my Department has granted permission on a small number of occasions for US military aircraft to land in Shannon for the specific purpose of transporting senior officials travelling from the United States to the Middle East.  I am fully satisfied that the stringent procedures for diplomatic clearance were followed in full on each of these occasions, meaning that the aircraft were unarmed; carried no arms, ammunition or explosives; were not engaged in intelligence gathering; and did not form part of a military exercise or operation.

I am pleased that all of the Irish citizens detained following their participations on the Global Sumud Flotilla, and the Freedom Flotilla, have returned home. Throughout the period the primary concern of the Government was to ensure the safety and wellbeing of all those detained. As such, officials from across my department, including our Embassy teams in Tel Aviv, Amman, Istanbul, and Ankara, provided all possible and appropriate consular assistance to all those affected. Recently, officials from my Department met with representatives of the Flotillas to hear first-hand their experiences.  The Tánaiste repeatedly expressed Ireland’s concerns about the security of the Flotilla and continually urged for respect for international law and international humanitarian law – raising the matter at EU and UN fora, and joining other Foreign Ministers in joint statements. We understand that the peaceful efforts of those on board reflect an understandable desire by many people around the world to urgently address the humanitarian needs of the people of Gaza.  This week I attended the Foreign Affairs Council in Brussels where I raised Ireland’s concern that the dire humanitarian situation in Gaza continues, despite two months of ceasefire. The people of Gaza do not have enough to eat, they do not have enough adequate shelter from winter weather, they lack sufficient access to healthcare, medicines and sanitation. I called on the EU to use its considerable leverage with Israel to urgently address this humanitarian catastrophe and will continue to ensure that the humanitarian situation in Gaza remains a focus at EU level.

I am pleased that all of the Irish citizens detained following their participations on the Global Sumud Flotilla, and the Freedom Flotilla, have returned home. Throughout the period the primary concern of the Government was to ensure the safety and wellbeing of all those detained. As such, officials from across my department, including our Embassy teams in Tel Aviv, Amman, Istanbul, and Ankara, provided all possible and appropriate consular assistance to all those affected. Recently, officials from my Department met with representatives of the Flotillas to hear first-hand their experiences.  The Tánaiste repeatedly expressed Ireland’s concerns about the security of the Flotilla and continually urged for respect for international law and international humanitarian law – raising the matter at EU and UN fora, and joining other Foreign Ministers in joint statements. We understand that the peaceful efforts of those on board reflect an understandable desire by many people around the world to urgently address the humanitarian needs of the people of Gaza.  This week I attended the Foreign Affairs Council in Brussels where I raised Ireland’s concern that the dire humanitarian situation in Gaza continues, despite two months of ceasefire. The people of Gaza do not have enough to eat, they do not have enough adequate shelter from winter weather, they lack sufficient access to healthcare, medicines and sanitation. I called on the EU to use its considerable leverage with Israel to urgently address this humanitarian catastrophe and will continue to ensure that the humanitarian situation in Gaza remains a focus at EU level.

The Convention on International Civil Aviation 1944 (Chicago Convention) confers the right for non-scheduled flights to both overfly and make stops for technical purposes in the territories of its contracting parties. 193 States are party to the Chicago Convention.  The International Air Services Transit Agreement 1944 affords these same rights to scheduled flights, approximately 135 States are party to this Agreement.  Within the EU, the air operators of Member States are provided the freedom to operate air services within the territory of the union in accordance with Regulation (EC) No 1008/2008.  Beyond the EU, the movement of commercial traffic, passengers and cargo by air, is managed through a framework of bilateral or multilateral agreements that the State is party to. These agreements grant rights to operate commercial air transport between the contracting parties. Privately operated and general aviation flights are not within scope of any of the aforementioned agreements and do not require permission to enter Irish airspace.  The exception to the above rights occurs when civil aircraft intend to carry munitions of war. Under the Air Navigation (Carriage of Munitions of War, Weapons and Dangerous Goods) Orders 1973 and 1989. the carriage of munitions of war on civil aircraft in Irish sovereign territory or on Irish-registered civil aircraft wherever they may be operating is prohibited, unless an exemption to do so is granted by the Minister for Transport.  The operation of foreign military aircraft in Irish sovereign territory is a matter for the Minister for Foreign Affairs. ",

        "answerText": " Minister for Transport  Ryanair Flight FR4978 from Athens International Airport, Greece, to Vilnius Airport, Lithuania was forced by Belarusian air traffic control to land in Belarus on 23 May 2021. The Ryanair flight was a regular scheduled route operated by Ryanair’s subsidiary Buzz, which is licensed in Poland. The aircraft was registered in Poland.  The reason for the forced landing was due to alleged claims of a bomb on board the aircraft. Upon landing in Belarus two passengers on board, journalist Roman Protasevich and his girlfriend Sofia Sapega, were arrested by authorities.  On 24 and 25 May 2021, the European Council adopted conclusions in which it strongly condemned the forced landing of the flight, endangering aviation safety, as well as condemning the detention by Belarusian authorities of Roman Pratasevich and Sofia Sapega. Following these conclusions the Council adopted additional listings of persons and entities to the restrictive measures in view of the situation in Belarus. In June 2021, Regulation (EC) 765 of 2006 was amended to prohibit any aircraft operated by Belarusian air carriers to land in, take off from or overfly the territory of the European Union. On 24 May that year the EU Aviation Safety Agency issued a safety directive formally halting European airlines from flying in Belarusian airspace. Criminal investigations were also initiated by the Polish and Lithuanian authorities.  The Council of International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO), which is a United Nations body responsible for the safety of global aviation, established a Fact-Finding Investigation Team (FFIT) to investigate the events. The FFIT were charged with establishing the facts of what happened and understanding whether there had been any breach by any ICAO Member State of international aviation law, including the Convention on International Civil Aviation (Chicago Convention) and its annexes.  In January 2022, the FFIT published its report which concluded that the bomb threat was deliberately false and further noted that the FFIT was not provided with all information by Belarus for the purpose of its investigation. In August 2022, the ICAO Council approved a draft paper for submission to the 41st ICAO Assembly which took place in October that year. At the Assembly, the findings of the ICAO FFIT Report were endorsed and the Assembly condemned the actions of Belarus. The Assembly also requested the ICAO Council to remain seized of the matter and to report back to Assembly as appropriate. The President of the ICAO Council also sent the FFIT report and the text of the Assembly Decisions to the UN Secretary General on 12 August 2022. Belarus was requested to address the FFIT findings but has thus far rejected the report findings. ",

        "answerText": " Minister of State at the Department of Education and Youth  I propose to take Questions Nos. 211 to 216, inclusive, and 245 to 250, inclusive, together.  The Department of Education and Youth is committed to an education-based, needs-led approach to accessing education services. The vast majority of children with special educational needs are supported to attend mainstream classes with their peers, through the provision of resources such as Special Education Teachers and Special Needs Assistants. This is an estimated 25% of the total student population, or 240,000 children and young people with special educational needs, that are supported in mainstream classes.  It is important to note that since 2017 children and young people in mainstream classes have not required a diagnosis of disability to access mainstream supports from the 15,000 special education teachers in our school system. In addition, the Department has removed the requirement for any health-based information to support transitions from a primary to a post-primary special class and/or for additional SNA requirements.  Additionally, while a diagnosis is currently required to access a special class or a special school, this does not have to be linked to an AON. Department officials are working on a process to remove the need for a diagnosis to access specialist supports in our school system which would be the last remaining requirement for a diagnosis in the education system.  The Department of Education and Youth will bring forward a proposal through a memorandum for government early in 2026 to agree a process which is intended to result in the removal of the requirement for professional reports, such as Assessment of Need reports, from entry requirements for special schools and special classes and the adoption of a needs-based approach, subject to the availability of necessary resources.  There will be a comprehensive consultation process with the full range of education stakeholders and advocacy groups in respect of this proposed measure.  It is also important to note that the Assessment of Need (AON) process is provided for under the Disability Act 2005 and is under the remit of the Health Service Executive (HSE). Assessment Officers working under the remit of the HSE are charged with organising the Assessment of Need. The Assessment Officer coordinates and completes the Assessment Report and a determination is made as to whether or not a child or young person meets the definition of disability contained in the Act.  Following on from a court ruling in October 2021 there is a legal obligation on the education system to assist the HSE as part of the HSE’s Assessment of Need Process (AON). In that regard, the NCSE nominates an appropriate person, a qualified teacher in the case of an AON pertaining to a school-going child, to assist the HSE by completing a Report of Education Need (RoEN) using information available or known to the teacher or school. This process was trialled and implemented in the 2024/2025 school year and was further refined in the 2025/2026 school year. The process is outlined in Circular 0069/2025 and will remain in place.  For clarity, there is no change to the AON process as it applies in schools.  The Department will continue to monitor and respond to future needs. As part of budget 2026, investment in special education has increased to €3 billion and allows for the recruitment of an additional 860 special education teachers, 1,717 Special Needs Assistants (SNAs) and the provision of an additional 3,000 places in special schools and special classes as well as the roll out of the new Educational Therapy Service.  This expansion reflects the Government’s commitment to inclusive education and ensuring every child with special educational needs receives the support they deserve. ",

        "answerText": " Minister of State at the Department of Education and Youth  I propose to take Questions Nos. 211 to 216, inclusive, and 245 to 250, inclusive, together.  The Department of Education and Youth is committed to an education-based, needs-led approach to accessing education services. The vast majority of children with special educational needs are supported to attend mainstream classes with their peers, through the provision of resources such as Special Education Teachers and Special Needs Assistants. This is an estimated 25% of the total student population, or 240,000 children and young people with special educational needs, that are supported in mainstream classes.  It is important to note that since 2017 children and young people in mainstream classes have not required a diagnosis of disability to access mainstream supports from the 15,000 special education teachers in our school system. In addition, the Department has removed the requirement for any health-based information to support transitions from a primary to a post-primary special class and/or for additional SNA requirements.  Additionally, while a diagnosis is currently required to access a special class or a special school, this does not have to be linked to an AON. Department officials are working on a process to remove the need for a diagnosis to access specialist supports in our school system which would be the last remaining requirement for a diagnosis in the education system.  The Department of Education and Youth will bring forward a proposal through a memorandum for government early in 2026 to agree a process which is intended to result in the removal of the requirement for professional reports, such as Assessment of Need reports, from entry requirements for special schools and special classes and the adoption of a needs-based approach, subject to the availability of necessary resources.  There will be a comprehensive consultation process with the full range of education stakeholders and advocacy groups in respect of this proposed measure.  It is also important to note that the Assessment of Need (AON) process is provided for under the Disability Act 2005 and is under the remit of the Health Service Executive (HSE). Assessment Officers working under the remit of the HSE are charged with organising the Assessment of Need. The Assessment Officer coordinates and completes the Assessment Report and a determination is made as to whether or not a child or young person meets the definition of disability contained in the Act.  Following on from a court ruling in October 2021 there is a legal obligation on the education system to assist the HSE as part of the HSE’s Assessment of Need Process (AON). In that regard, the NCSE nominates an appropriate person, a qualified teacher in the case of an AON pertaining to a school-going child, to assist the HSE by completing a Report of Education Need (RoEN) using information available or known to the teacher or school. This process was trialled and implemented in the 2024/2025 school year and was further refined in the 2025/2026 school year. The process is outlined in Circular 0069/2025 and will remain in place.  For clarity, there is no change to the AON process as it applies in schools.  The Department will continue to monitor and respond to future needs. As part of budget 2026, investment in special education has increased to €3 billion and allows for the recruitment of an additional 860 special education teachers, 1,717 Special Needs Assistants (SNAs) and the provision of an additional 3,000 places in special schools and special classes as well as the roll out of the new Educational Therapy Service.  This expansion reflects the Government’s commitment to inclusive education and ensuring every child with special educational needs receives the support they deserve. ",

This expansion reflects the Government’s commitment to inclusive education and ensuring every child with special educational needs receives the support they deserve. ",

        "answerText": " Minister of State at the Department of Education and Youth  I propose to take Questions Nos. 211 to 216, inclusive, and 245 to 250, inclusive, together.  The Department of Education and Youth is committed to an education-based, needs-led approach to accessing education services. The vast majority of children with special educational needs are supported to attend mainstream classes with their peers, through the provision of resources such as Special Education Teachers and Special Needs Assistants. This is an estimated 25% of the total student population, or 240,000 children and young people with special educational needs, that are supported in mainstream classes.  It is important to note that since 2017 children and young people in mainstream classes have not required a diagnosis of disability to access mainstream supports from the 15,000 special education teachers in our school system. In addition, the Department has removed the requirement for any health-based information to support transitions from a primary to a post-primary special class and/or for additional SNA requirements.  Additionally, while a diagnosis is currently required to access a special class or a special school, this does not have to be linked to an AON. Department officials are working on a process to remove the need for a diagnosis to access specialist supports in our school system which would be the last remaining requirement for a diagnosis in the education system.  The Department of Education and Youth will bring forward a proposal through a memorandum for government early in 2026 to agree a process which is intended to result in the removal of the requirement for professional reports, such as Assessment of Need reports, from entry requirements for special schools and special classes and the adoption of a needs-based approach, subject to the availability of necessary resources.  There will be a comprehensive consultation process with the full range of education stakeholders and advocacy groups in respect of this proposed measure.  It is also important to note that the Assessment of Need (AON) process is provided for under the Disability Act 2005 and is under the remit of the Health Service Executive (HSE). Assessment Officers working under the remit of the HSE are charged with organising the Assessment of Need. The Assessment Officer coordinates and completes the Assessment Report and a determination is made as to whether or not a child or young person meets the definition of disability contained in the Act.  Following on from a court ruling in October 2021 there is a legal obligation on the education system to assist the HSE as part of the HSE’s Assessment of Need Process (AON). In that regard, the NCSE nominates an appropriate person, a qualified teacher in the case of an AON pertaining to a school-going child, to assist the HSE by completing a Report of Education Need (RoEN) using information available or known to the teacher or school. This process was trialled and implemented in the 2024/2025 school year and was further refined in the 2025/2026 school year. The process is outlined in Circular 0069/2025 and will remain in place.  For clarity, there is no change to the AON process as it applies in schools.  The Department will continue to monitor and respond to future needs. As part of budget 2026, investment in special education has increased to €3 billion and allows for the recruitment of an additional 860 special education teachers, 1,717 Special Needs Assistants (SNAs) and the provision of an additional 3,000 places in special schools and special classes as well as the roll out of the new Educational Therapy Service.
