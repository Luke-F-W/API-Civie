        "answerText": " Mr. Quinn  I propose to take Questions Nos. 2 and 3 together.  The Government is currently examining the most appropriate corporation tax structure for the long-term having regard to the central importance of the 10 per cent rate for inward investment and employment creation.  As Deputies will be aware, the 10 per cent rate for manufacturing industry and certain internationally traded services is due to continue to end-2010 while the 10 per cent rate for the IFSC and the Shannon Zone is due to continue to end-2005.  While the deadlines are still a considerable time away, the Government recognises the need to clarify the position as soon as possible to facilitate new investment by overseas firms wishing to locate in Ireland and by firms already established here.  I expect that the examination which is currently under way will be completed at an early date and that it will be possible for the Government to make an announcement in the near future.  On the question of tax harmonisation, I am not aware of any plans at EU level for a general harmonisation of income tax or corporation tax. There is, however, broad acceptance among EU Finance Ministers of the need to achieve greater co-ordination of taxation policies between member states to ensure that these are consistent with European Union objectives in respect of economic and monetary union and the Single Market. A high-level policy group under the chairmanship of Commissioner Monti has been set up to examine these issues and report to the Council in due course on what initiatives might be considered in this area. \n Mr. McCreevy  I tabled this question on a previous occasion.  During the past number of months, the Minister indicated that the Government will be introducing its strategy in the near future.  Recent newspaper reports indicate that the Government is about to make an announcement in that regard.  When will that announcement be made?  The international companies involved would like a decision in the near future. Will the announcement be made within the next week or so?  I am sure the Minister read the recent reports to which I referred. \n Mr. Quinn  I announced in the budget on 22 January that we would be addressing this issue. Like the two Deputies opposite, who are their respective parties' spokespersons on Finance, we met different groups which expressed concern, particularly in respect of companies that are already established here and contemplating substantial capital investment programmes — notably in the pharmaceuticals area — and said they would like an indication of what the rate might be after 2010.  We recognise their concern and are working towards clarifying the situation. However, a number of issues and factors must be taken into account.  The more this matter has been discussed, the more relevant these issues have become in terms of resolving or addressing  the consequences of either putting in place a single rate or a range of rates.  In addition, the non-10 per cent rate has been decreased.  The relevant rates are now 36 per cent and 28 per cent, respectively.  The direction of the non-10 per cent rate is converging towards what might be regarded as a probable or possible single rate.  However, this matter involves many complex issues and we are trying to resolve as many as possible before a final decision is made.  I am not in a position to inform the Deputy when that decision will be made.  The newspaper reports to which he referred reflect the impact of our ongoing work. \n Mr. McCreevy  Will it be announced within the next month? \n Mr. Quinn  I do not know. \n Mr. M. McDowell  I would be remiss if I did not remark on the Minister's socialist sartorial appearance.  He is wearing a red tie and a red rose and I do not doubt that he is looking forward to an evening celebration. \n Mr. Quinn  There is one taking place at the Lansdowne Rugby Club to which the Deputy is invited. \n Mr. M. McDowell  In the spirit of the day, I must express my delight that a Government committed to low tax rates, further privatisation and proper control of public spending will be elected in England today.  I hope the same thing happens here. \n Mr. McCreevy  I hope there will be no references to Thomas Dewey during the celebrations. \n Mr. M. McDowell  When I saw the rose and tie worn by the Minister, I could not help but remark upon his appearance.  Is the Minister not aware of the considerable media coverage of an EU Commission agenda to investigate the harmonisation of corporation tax and income tax rates?  Articles about this matter have appeared in various journals and some leading financial institutions in this country have informed me they apprehend that such an agenda is afoot.  With regard to the manufacturing and the IFSC rates, does the Minister agree that there is cross-party consensus that a rate of between 10 per cent to 13 per cent is required in respect of all services? Is there substance in the suggestion that, in approaching a low standard rate for manufacturing and services, the Department is examining the introduction of a different rate in respect of passive income such as rentals, investments, etc., rather than core manufacturing, services and production activities? \n Mr. Quinn  With regard to the harmonisation of income tax and corporation tax, various proposals have been put forward by those countries  in the European Union with relatively high corporation tax rates.  However, these countries do not want to see the introduction of high excise duties on alcohol.  They are attempting to reduce what they regard as a competitive disadvantage without seeing the other side of the coin.  Under the European Union Treaties, the question of taxation for individual member states is governed by unanimity and there are no proposals to change that.  The principle of subsidiarity must allow and enable individual member states to adopt a tax regime they are prepared to take on to maximise the potential for economic activity within their own jurisdictions.  The Deputy will be familiar with the situation in the United States where different corporate tax structures prevail side by side.  I visited the offices of Merrill Lynch which are situated in Wall Street on the island of Manhattan and I was shown the company's corporate support offices across the Hudson River in New Jersey.  I was informed that the support offices are situated in New Jersey because the tax rate in that state is considerably less than the combined tax rates in New York City and New York State.  I do not believe the European Union can proceed to establish a standard rate of income tax and corporation tax.  I know of no federal, federalist or post-federal country where such a regime exists.  A regime of that type would not be in the interests of the Union or of the member states. Therefore, I do not expect that one will be introduced.  The Deputy's second question referred to differentials between traded income — if one wants to use that phrase — and passive income.  That issue must be addressed because the movement down from, say, 36 per cent or 28 per cent to a low rate of the order the Deputy suggested, without anything else happening, could bestow an extraordinary windfall advantage on people, with no material benefit from the point of view of the economy and without creating any extra employment or wealth.  It is the very complexity of those issues that necessitates our examining very carefully how we should address people's very real desire for some degree of certainty post-2010.  As a country, one of the great advantages we have had is that, for some considerable time, we have provided tax certainty in respect of both domestic and foreign direct investment on which we have had all party support; it has not become a domestic political football as has been the case in other jurisdictions.  I welcome that and supported it when in Opposition.  Indeed it has been one of our key strengths and will be the factor which will influence my considerations in all of this. \n Mr. McCreevy  We went over this ground on the last occasion on which the Minister answered questions here.  As he correctly points out, we have all been lobbied by IBEC and its subsidiary groups in this respect.  The Minister announced at budget time that a decision on this matter was  imminent.  Over recent weeks it appeared that that decision would be taken.  The Minister could be more forthcoming and state whether it is intended to strike a rate, indicate the range of rates and whether it will discriminate between passive and traded income?  Although this occurs in the case of all Governments, press officers of Departments are now more in tune with informing their friends in the media than Members of this House.  It is legitimate that Members should know first-hand as it was obvious over the past ten days or so that a decision on this matter was imminent.  The Minister should be more forthcoming in informing us of the announcement we can expect within the next two weeks or so, if not before.  At the very least, can the Minister say whether this decision will be taken within the next fortnight and, if so, what it is likely to be? \n Mr. Quinn  I respect Members of this House and, in the course of replies I have been as direct, honest and frank as possible.  No decision has been taken; the matter is under active consideration. We are also aware of the increasing demand for clarity on this and of the general desire that such decision be taken sooner rather than later.  We have not clarified the issues; we have had some discussion on some of them.  Since the benefit of all of this is to provide certainty in the marketplace and to would-be investors, a decision that would not constitute an answer to supplementary questions and leave much ambiguity hanging over it, would not be helpful to anybody. \n Mr. McCreevy  There was a very detailed report in the newspapers. \n Mr. Quinn  A lot of detailed work is being done. \n Mr. M. McDowell  By journalists. \n Mr. Quinn  Both Deputies McCreevy and Michael McDowell are very knowledgeable in these areas.  Deputy McDowell referred to some issues warranting consideration.  There is also the overall question of the impact on tax revenue in ensuing years and the transitional arrangements might be entered into, all of which are being examined.  As soon as we are in a position to take a decision I can assure Members they will be informed and I will do so with the utmost courtesy. \n Mr. McCreevy  In the month of May? \n Mr. Quinn  I honestly do not know.  Were I in a position to say what will happen within the next few weeks I would give such an indication.  A decision will be announced when we are in a position to do so.  I would be misleading the House were I to say it might occur within the next couple of weeks and then, for whatever reason, it did not occur. \n Mr. M. McDowell  I welcome what the Minister  said about tax harmonisation.  Indeed the message should emanate from this House that the overall objective of a harmonised income and corporation tax regime in Europe is anathema to this country and we do not want to go down that road.  Will the Minister confirm that it will be made very clear at the next ECOFIN Ministerial Council meeting or whatever — if this is part of the European Union Commission's medium to long-term agenda — we want to have no hand, act or part in it?  On tax harmonisation, does the Minister agree that in some areas of so-called passive income one would need a scalpel to divide what is passive from what is active income?  I have in mind in particular our banking institutions because some contend that a section 84 loan was the nearest thing to passive income there ever was.  Does the Minister agree it would be very difficult to divorce what is happening within the International Financial Services Centre from ordinary banking activities?  Will he say to his European colleagues, with his hand on his heart, he is not engaging in an aid to geographical distortion?  If the Minister is going to draw a distinction between passive and traded income, does he agree that that will have to be very clearly and concisely signalled to the market so that people, when making plans, will know, roughly speaking, which side of a difference between 12 per cent or 10 per cent and, say, 25 per cent or 30 per cent, their industrial or market activities will fall? \n Mr. Quinn  By his question Deputy McDowell is illuminating the reasons we are taking time to examine all of these issues.  On the timeframe of 2010, were we in a totally open position, we would not be proposing to change it.  The expectation is that we will be required to change it in some form or other and it is for that reason we are addressing that issue.  The complexities of tax harmonisation are ones I support.  I can confirm that we have adopted a position, with regard to the Intergovernmental Conference, that unanimity of voting in ECOFIN on taxation issues will remain, so that we retain our independence to determine tax rates within the broad parameters of what does and does not constitute State aids.

        "answerText": " Mr. Quinn  Both my colleague, the Minister for Social Welfare, and I have previously answered questions from the Deputy on this topic.  It might be useful if I were to outline again the general rules which apply in this area and the thinking behind them.  In 1994, a review of the treatment of maintenance payments for the purposes of levies and PRSI was undertaken by officials of my Department, the Office of the Revenue Commissioners and the Departments of Social Welfare, Health and Enterprise and Employment.  With regard to the health contribution and employment and training levy, it was agreed they should not be imposed on that part of the payer's income which is paid to his or her separated spouse under an enforceable maintenance agreement.  The appropriate changes in the law were included in the Social Welfare Act, 1995, and had effect from 6 April 1995.  This brings the treatment of maintenance payments for the purposes of the levies into  line with their treatment in the income tax system.  The interdepartmental review involving separated spouses also concluded there should be no change in the PRSI treatment of maintenance payments.  The payment of separate PRSI contributions enables each spouse to build up a social insurance record in their own right, and they can both, in due course, qualify for a pension.  A provision in the Divorce Act, extends this treatment to people who obtain divorces within this country.  Entitlement to a social insurance pension is a valuable right and affords protection to separated or divorced spouses.  It is, therefore, important for the protection of their individual pension rights that social insurance contributions be made by the recipients of maintenance payments.  Maintenance payments are not regarded merely as a transfer from one individual to another, but in these circumstances each individual's income is regarded as being a separate entity for social insurance purposes.  The logic behind both parties paying PRSI is that social insurance contributions confer substantial benefits on the contributor and ensure an adequate level of social protection.  It is believed the arrangement whereby recipients of maintenance payments make social insurance contributions is equitable.  It appears the Deputy is seeking to equate, for PRSI purposes, the treatment of a married couple with that of a separated couple.  It must be accepted that a separated or divorced couple are now two distinct entities whose pension rights should be individually catered for, rather than as a single unit, which clearly they are not.  In relation to introducing a tax allowance for PRSI purposes, I have no plans to introduce such an allowance either for separated or divorced persons on equity grounds or in general on the grounds of cost. \n Mr. M. McDowell  The majority of separated people are not aware of the PRSI liability on maintenance payments between husband and wife.  They do not pay it and would be astounded to hear they are liable for it.  I fail to grasp the Minister's logic that there is a stronger case for imposing PRSI on two people whose marriage has broken down to the degree that they have formalised their payments on a monthly basis when one ignores married couples who are just getting on in a loose arrangement with money being put on the kitchen table with no PRSI deduction.  Will the Minister indicate what rate of PRSI applies to such payments?  Does the paying spouse have to make a deduction in PRSI?  Must the receiving spouse, normally the wife, send in a portion of her maintenance to the Revenue Commissioners? Most people are completely unaware of this and would consider it deeply unfair and inequitable. \n Mr. Quinn  I appreciate the Deputy's concern.  The questions are complex as are the replies and I will try to facilitate the Deputy with the information available to me.  PRSI is paid at a rate of 5 per cent on maintenance payments.  Deputy McDowell wants to know why is it higher than the generally applied class A rate of 4.5 per cent and why the PRSI free allowance of £80 is not available to the recipient.  The estranged person on maintenance is clearly paying a higher contribution than the payee and he wants to know how this is justifiable. \n Mr. M. McDowell  An employee gets an allowance. \n Mr. Quinn  The PRSI arrangements for class A employees are as follows: an employer pays 8.5 per cent on earnings up to £260 per week and 12 per cent where earnings exceed that subject to a ceiling of £27,900 and the employee pays 4.5 per cent on earnings up to £23,200 with a PRSI free allowance of £80 per week.  Self-employed and persons receiving maintenance payments pay 5 per cent on income over £20 per week.  These contrasting arrangements, having regard to the entitlements which ensue, are considered equitable for the different categories. \n Mr. M. McDowell  I do not know who considers them equitable because they are astonishingly draconian.  A wife must cough up 5 per cent of what she receives under a maintenance agreement and is told this is equitable because if she was working and receiving the same amount of money her employer would to have pay PRSI also.  This is an outrageous imposition on people, most of whom cannot afford it.  They are in enough difficulty running two households because they have separated.  Does the Minister agree the proposition that a wife must cough up 5 per cent of her maintenance payments to the Revenue Commissioners is astonishing?  If the public knew about this, there would be a revolution. The fact that it is unknown is the only reason it has not been changed.  If it were widely known, would the Minister agree it would be the cause of huge uproar?  Does he agree that the vast majority of separated people do not comply?  I have never heard of a wife who sent money to the Revenue Commissioners.  It is an extraordinary imposition and tax on people whose lives are blighted enough normally.  Most Irish people cannot afford two households out of one salary and this is an outrageous imposition on maintenance payments. \n Mr. Quinn  We are aware of the economic hardship which can result from marital breakdown. It is precisely because separated couples face different economic circumstances that the current arrangement for social insurance contributions was introduced.  The protection of the estranged spouse was at the core of this issue at the outset.  Maintenance payments are not subject  to double taxation and the remaining anomaly in this regard — the issue of the double payment of the levies — has been resolved.  Social insurance is not a tax.  It is based on a contributory principle by which future benefits can be secured. \n Mr. M. McDowell  Last week the Minister said the £300 million included PRSI. \n Mr. Quinn  It is of vital importance that the pension rights of both spouses are protected in the event of marital breakdown and this is the sole reason that social insurance contributions be made by the payer and recipient of maintenance payments.  I am sure the Deputy will concede that future individual pension rights are in the best interests of separated couples and this situation is fundamentally different from that of married couples. \n Mr. McCreevy  I declare an interest in the matter. Perhaps the Minister's officials could issue details in regard to this for Members because it is complicated.  The reason it is rated at 5 per cent is because it is based on the self employed PRSI rate.  That is the only justification for it subject to a minimum of £215 per week in 1996/7.  Will the Minister confirm that the 5 per cent rate only covers future pension entitlements and does not entitle a person to any other benefits under the social insurance contributions?  I agree with Deputy McDowell that it should be changed. \n Mr. M. McDowell  Why not make it voluntary? \n Mr. McCreevy  There is provision for self-employed voluntary PRSI contributions. \n Mr. Quinn  I recognise Deputy McDowell's considerable concern on this issue.  He has raised it on a number of occasions previously and I agree that many people are not aware of their obligations in this area.  I will raise the matter with the Minister for Social Welfare to see how this issue can be addressed.  I think Deputy McCreevy's intervention is correct with regards to the pension entitlement and why it is rated at the same rate as the self-employed but I must have it confirmed. ",

        "answerText": " Mr. Yates:  The disallowance imposed by the EU Commission in respect of some 1989 export  refund payments represented 7 per cent of the export refunds paid to eight beneficiaries in respect of these transactions.  These transactions were proofed by four Bureau Veritas certificates. The disallowance was imposed because at the time of the Commission audit in 1992-3 detailed back up documentation relevant to these certificates was not available as it had been destroyed in Baghdad during the Gulf War.  However, supporting documentation which was still available at the Paris headquarters of Bureau Veritas was accepted as sufficient import proof to confine the disallowance to 7 per cent.  It is not the case that the Commission proved that these certificates did not comply with the terms of Regulation (EEC) 3665/87.  If there had been any evidence that the beef concerned had not in fact reached Iraq, the Commission would have a full 100 per cent disallowance.  By 1992 when the EU auditors reviewed these cases the processing of the files had been completed and almost all the securities relating to this 1989 trade had been released.  Security releases must be done in a timely manner to avoid disallowances which can be imposed on grounds of delay alone.  It was not possible to pass on the disallowance to the exporters concerned given the decisions taken and acted upon in the early 1990s and the fact that no fraud was ever alleged.  With regard to a review of more recent years, the Deputy may be interested to learn the results of an intensive systems audit carried out by the Commission into beef export refund prefinancing expenditure in six member states.  In Ireland the total expenditure audited amounted to £361 million in 1993 and 1994.  The results have just been received — major disallowances of the order of 5 to 10 per cent of total expenditure have been imposed on the other five member states concerned, with no disallowances for Ireland. \n Mr. O'Malley:  Is the Minister aware that in June 1994 when these matters came to light and the shortcomings in the certificates were drawn to the Department's attention Mr. Gerry Cody wrote a memorandum to his superiors saying that in the circumstance we would have to consider living with the level of disallowance and recovering same from either AIBP or BV or both?  That advice was given in the Department by Mr. Cody.  Why was it not followed? \n Mr. Yates:  I was not aware of that advice.  The advice I received, however, was that something like the general EU beef fine was not specific to a particular consignment or company and that it was not appropriate to do this.  There was also a question of the EU changing the goal posts subsequently.Eight exporters were the beneficiaries of the disallowance of £2.29 million, a percentage of four Bureau Veritas certificates covering 89 exports to Iraq.  Recovery was not possible where decisions had been taken and acted on in early 1990 and where no fraud was proven or alleged.  On the Deputy's point on the defacing of certificates,  apparently there is no disallowance on the 1998 certificates.  This relates to a point made by the Deputy at the Committee of Public Account that there was defacing of certificates. No disallowance from the EU relates to those certificates.  The dates were independently verified and there was no undue benefit to any individual.I was told that it was not possible to recover for two reasons.  First, the decisions had been acted on so that when the matter came to light in 1994 in the clearance of account, it was too late and, second, the disallowances were a general 7 per cent of the overall tranche and did not relate to a particular consignment of meat where civil proceedings were under way, for example, in the Rathkeale case. \n Mr. O'Malley:  The Rathkeale case has nothing to do with export refunds. \n Mr. Yates:  I know that.  I said there was a difference in the fines. \n Mr. O'Malley:  I asked the Minister a specific supplementary question and he read out points he said he was asked to make which had nothing to do with the question.  It is extraordinary that the Minister sees himself as a messenger for other people who wish to make points which he makes irrespective of the question he is asked.  If the Minister is not aware of the advice of Mr. Cody of the trade mechanisms division which deals with this, will he make himself aware of it?  Was Mr. Cody overruled by a senior official who did not want proceedings taken against AIBP or BV or both, as was recommended?  Is the Minister aware of his obligation under article 8 of the governing regulation, regulation 729/70, where he must recover all sums lost?  If he fails to make an effort, the Exchequer, as in this case, must bear the burden rather than the EU which would otherwise assume liability. \n Mr. Yates:  The Deputy slightly misrepresented the point I was trying to make.  In terms of the briefing I received, there is a view in the Department that the Deputy is confusing two separate types of Bureau Veritas certificates which were discussed at the Committee of Public Accounts.  I made those points so that the Deputy might be relieved of any misapprehension he may have.  I refer to the Deputy's net point on recovery. Recovery of the disallowance which was imposed is unfortunately not possible.  A huge number and variety of import proof documents from custom services and agencies around the world are received by this Department under the export refund system.  The acceptability or otherwise of these documents must be judged on a case by case basis and there are few hard and fast rules upon which to rely.  It is only at a stage when decisions have been made and acted upon and there is no legal recourse against the exporter that the Commission auditors  pass their judgement on the decisions taken and can impose disallowances.  The fact that a disallowance is levied on Ireland does not of itself give entitlement to recover any part of the disallowance from companies.  Proceedings brought against companies must be based on a recognised course of action in Irish law and be proven in accordance with the ordinary rules of civil proceedings.The cause of action must be essentially related to alleged wrong doing by the companies concerned and, in this case, no fraud has been proven or alleged.  The Commission did not relate the amounts given to individual exporters, files, consignments, etc., to any specific loss of Community funds. \n Mr. O'Malley:  I have heard that before but why does Mr. Cody of the Minister's Department, who has it as part of his duties—— \n Mr. Yates:  What date was on that advice? \n Mr. O'Malley:  16 June 1994.  Why did he recommend that the Department should recover same either from AIBP or BV or both?  He is an expert in these matters if he works in the Department's trade mechanisms section.  He does nothing else except this.  He knows what he is talking about and that the money is recoverable under 729/70.  It is nothing to do with Irish law but the obligation under European law.  Why are these companies consistently doing this?  This is the third or fourth example I have given where export refunds were unduly or wrongly paid by the Department and the securities wrongly released, only for the Department to say that, although those people were improperly paid and enriched, the taxpayer can pay for it and those people can be allowed to keep the money. \n Mr. Deasy:  Who was Minister for Agriculture in June 1992?  It was not Deputy Yates. \n Mr. Yates:  No, nor was I Minister in 1991. \n Mr. O'Malley:  He was Minister when he released the securities. \n Mr. Yates:  I want to make it clear that those releases and the largest ever forfeiture in the history of the State, against the Goodman group, of which the Deputy will be aware, were put through every conceivable wringer of independent legal and financial advice and I am satisfied they could be put under no further scrutiny.  I sent a lengthy, four page letter to the Deputy on 21 April about the Bureau Veritas certificates.  I also suggested to the Assistant Secretary in the Department, Mr. Denis Byrne, that he should try and reach the Deputy, as these are very technical matters.  We will try to improve on any information the Deputy has with which he is dissatisfied.Irrespective of what Mr. Cody advised or did not advise in June 1994, the advice now available to me at the most senior level in the Department is that there would be no winnable case for the  recovery of the money and it would be putting good money after bad to pursue a case which would be unsuccessful. \n Mr. O'Malley:  Why did the Minister tell me on 26 March that there was only one Bureau Veritas certificate not signed by Mr. Gurney when I have since sent him three?  Was that not misleading this House?  Did the Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs, in reply to a written question on the same date, not say the same, apparently basing it on information from the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry?  It has been shown to be untrue and the Minister acknowledges that in the letter he sent to me.  Why has he not taken steps to correct the record and apologise to the House for the wrong information given? \n Mr. Yates:  I understand the personal statement made by the Tánaiste, of which I was aware, reflected the Government position and, I thought, dealt with this point as regards the error which I regret was made. \n Mr. O'Malley:  When was the personal statement made by the Tánaiste? \n Mr. Yates:  I received a copy of a draft of a personal statement which he made to the House. He discussed it with me.  I am not sure at what time he made it but I have a copy of it in my office. \n Mr. O'Malley:  To the best of my knowledge — I am sure I would have been told being the Deputy concerned — the Tánaiste has made no personal statement and has allowed the record to go uncorrected in respect of that matter and another in which I was given wrong information. \n Mr. Yates:  I will check that out but all I can tell the Deputy is that there was dialogue between the Departments of Foreign Affairs and Agriculture, Food and Forestry.  An explanation was furnished to me by the Tánaiste for the error and the wrong information the Deputy was given and why that was so.  I saw the draft of a personal statement which it was not my business to deliver. We had supplied further information to the Department.  I do not know whether the Tánaiste subsequently delivered that statement or sent it by post to the Deputy.  Perhaps it is with the Ceann Comhairle's office and I can check that out and let him know. \n Mr. Yates:  I propose to take Questions Nos. 13, 17, 23 and 31 together.  I am very unhappy with the prices paid by factories for cattle at this time.  The price is now approximately 10 per cent lower in national currency than this time last year.  The main cause of the current difficulties is the reduction of export refunds which has been brought about by the EU Commission in an attempt to stay within the GATT limits on subsidised exports.  These limits have been put under further pressure in the past year due to a substantial fall in EU beef consumption arising from the BSE situation.  This has significantly increased the surplus of beef on the Community market and made it more difficult to stay within the limits on EU subsidised exports agreed in the context of the last GATT agreement.  The effect of these reductions in exports refunds on Irish producers has been exacerbated by the revaluation of the Irish agriculture conversion rate.  The changes in export refunds over the past years are as follows: 1 May 1996 — 12 per cent increase in refunds; 14 January 1997 — 10 per cent reduction in refunds; 26 March 1997 — 7.5 per cent reduction in refunds; 18 April 1997 — 5 per cent reduction in refunds for bone-in male beef, boneless male hindquarter beef and live exports of male cattle; 15 per cent reduction in all other categories, mostly female.  I have made strong and frequent representations to Commissioner Fischler regarding these cuts, most recently at the Council of Ministers meeting in Luxembourg earlier this week.  I have emphasised the specific problems the Commission's approach has created for beef producers, especially our winter finishers, because of the heavy dependence of the Irish beef trade on third country markets.  I have asked the Commission to abandon this approach and, instead, to manage the licensing system through the application of reducing coefficients.  I stressed the importance in that context of reversing the recent reductions in export refunds and I am taking other actions to support market prices.  As regards reductions in cattle prices arising from the revaluation of the Irish agricultural conversion rate, I have already answered that question and pointed out the measures we intend to implement.  I have also pointed out the adjustment to the deseasonalisation slaughter premium I secured last year which is worth £20 million or 7p per pound.  I consider that extremely important in alleviating farmers' difficulties. \n Mr. O'Malley:  Is the Minister aware that the position reached with these constant reductions over the past 12 months of export refunds has been further exacerbated by the revaluation of the green currency?  The losses suffered are not just the accumulated reduction in beef export refunds but are augmented by the green currency revaluation.  All of it together has resulted in a disastrous situation in which there has been a serious fall in the price of cattle, many markets are closed at the same time and there is much less competition for cattle than one or two years ago. This is highly unsatisfactory.  What does the Minister propose to do about it? \n Mr. Yates:  I am not sure whether the Deputy was here earlier.  At national level I propose to pay £50 per head for every steer and heifer slaughtered from 1 April to 10 June which is the end of the DSP period.  This will affect those who suffered most.  After the latest revaluation on Easter Saturday prices dropped by 5p or 6p per pound.  The £50 per head being paid for by the Irish taxpayer is separate from the £11 million which we will be paying in further compensation and results in a £184 million package over one year for beef.  I raised the matter of the export refunds.  The cumulative effect of the cut in refunds would be approximately 25 per cent.  The effect of the revaluation is about 6 per cent.  This means a 30 per cent reduction in subsidies.  The GATT quota is impacting severely.  Consumption of beef in Europe is down by approximately 500,000 tonnes as a result of BSE.  If beef is not eaten in Europe and does not go into intervention, it must be sold outside Europe. The GATT quota is 1 million tonnes and it is declining each year.  We carried forward 100,000 tonnes of unused GATT licences from last year. From now until the end of June there is only 16,800 tonnes left per week.  If trade is to continue there must be an orderly disposal.  Even since the refund cut last Thursday, prefixations for licences are 22,000 tonnes.  Despite efforts to take the heat out of the demand for licences, we will find it difficult not to exhaust the GATT quota before the GATT year expires.  I have put detailed proposals to the Commission in relation to a different way of sharing the limited licences such as the application of a coefficient and the introduction of a differential rate of licence for non-transferrable licence so people cannot speculate on them.  One would only take out a licence for what one was likely  to export oneself.  There is so little to distribute between now and the end of the GATT year that this will continue on a weekly basis.  The latest cut should be enough to see it through this year.  The Commission's management of the quota will have to be revised.  It will be much tighter next year because the GATT quota will decrease by 220,000 tonnes. \n An Leas-Cheann Comhairle:  Time is all but exhausted so brevity would help. \n Mr. Deasy:  I congratulate the Minister for doing his best in difficult circumstances.  The measures which are causing the collapse in the price of beef are beyond his control.  The disastrous GATT negotiations concluded by the Agriculture Commissioner, Mr. McSharry, three years ago are responsible for the considerable reduction in export refunds which impact upon the price of cattle.  People should bear this mind and stop being unfair to the Minister.  Are meat factories exploiting the situation, as generally perceived by the farming community? What additional moneys should they be paying in comparison to the present prices?  Is it 2p, 4p or 7p per pound?  What is the Minister doing to knock together the heads of meat factory proprietors who are trying to exploit the situation to their advantage? \n Mr. Yates:  I concur with Deputy Deasy.  As a former Minister for Agriculture he knows the reality of the situation and his analysis is correct. The GATT deal agreed in 1993 set out the terms, coupled with the CAP reform.  The CAP reform took away the safety net.  When BSE struck in 1990, there was an intervention safety net.  Nine out of every ten bullocks went into intervention. The safety net for intervention beef for Ireland is 72p per pound.  It is not worth a damn to us.  The liberalisation of agricultural trade in the Blair House agreement has resulted in a situation whereby we are prohibited by a legally binding agreement from giving a subsidy, which was 64p per pound, to beef which we cannot sell in Europe.  Once one reaches 1 million tonnes that is it, not one more ounce of beef can be subsidised.That is the difficulty because three out of four cattle in Ireland are exported to third countries.We are more dependent on that trade than any other member state.  There is no black and white analysis which will say to what extent the meat factories are responsible for the current low price.  The factories need to answer certain questions.  Regardless of the fact that they have 30 day prefixations at refunds before they are cut, why do they apply the cut immediately?  If a meat factory has a consignment of beef which it is going to fill from something prefixed four weeks ago, why does it apply a price cut immediately even though the effect takes some weeks to work through the system?  The factories must state whether they are profiting from the rapidity with which they apply the refunds. \n Mr. Deasy:  The Minister should withdraw their licences if they do not play ball. \n An Leas-Cheann Comhairle:  We do not have time for interruptions. \n Mr. Yates:  Farmers have always believed that when there is no live trade to compete with the mart, the meat factories seem able to collude in what appears to be a cartel in that there is no difference in the price they offer for Us, Os or Rs.  Why is this?  Some of them have business with Algeria, Saudi Arabia, the UK and so on.  The factories must also explain how it is that, with the same level of refund and intervention, there is such a discrepancy in prices between Ireland and the rest of Europe.  Beef prices are 20 to 30 per cent higher on the Continent.  We would supply most of those markets only with cow or heifer beef but why is female beef not more reflective of the price in the UK or the Continent?The meat factories have exacerbated a bad situation.  I will take my share of the responsibility but with BSE and GATT I am in the wrong place at the wrong time.  I have to work through a system of trying to find compensation and stopgap supports in the most difficult circumstances. \n Mr. J. Walsh:  Would the Minister agree that the management of the regime is the problem?  Is he going to Cairo to reopen markets which were locked up to now?  What is taking the Minister to Cairo if he cannot open the markets?  Is the Libyan market closed?  Is it not true that the factories will operate as a cartel because they are in a commercial environment and will pay the lowest price they can? \n Mr. Deasy:  They are licensed by the State. \n Mr. J. Walsh:  What is the point of the Minister's complaining?  Impoverished beef farmers want to know what the Minister is doing about introducing a system of transparency.  This would allow us to know whether factories should be paying 2p or 3p more or less per pound.  For example, in the diary industry there was a lot of transparency introduced so that they had to pay the going rate.  The House and farmers want to know what the Minister is doing to insist that factories pay the prevailing rate? \n Mr. Yates:  The Deputy will be aware that I was in Luxembourg this week and Agriculture Commissioner Fischler said to me that given the GATT quotas and that there are six weeks to run, Ireland could not seek non-existent refunds, and would have the same rate as any other member state.  I proposed APS to deal with residual winter fatteners, 20,000 tonnes of beef, to raise prices in the short-term.  However, when I returned this morning I discovered the meat factories will not operate APS, they do not want to know about it. There appears to be a conflict between the legally possible and affordable measures I am endeavouring  to take to support prices which the Commission is examining, and which may or may not be accepted at the beef management committee on Friday next, and the meat factories concentration, not on reflecting producer prices but on their own returns.  Commissioner Fischler believes Irish meat factories bear some responsibility for the prevailing price here.  While I do not suggest they should take all the blame, neither should they escape their responsibilities.  In relation to third countries, the same GATT quota would apply to live or dead exports, animals on the hoof or processed beef.  While I am open to any suggestions on transparency, whenever the export refund is suspended or reduced, invariably one hears of some meat factories that had prefixations while others had not.  Yet, when prices drop, they all pay the same, which smacks of collusion. \n Mr. Deasy:  ——or racketeering. \n Mr. Yates:  We are experiencing difficulties vis-à-vis three markets only, Egypt, Iran and Libya, because there were 73 cases of BSE here last year, compared with 16 cases only the year before.  Had numbers continued to decrease we would continue to export to all of those markets. A number of countries were picked out — France, Portugal and Ireland, all next in league after the United Kingdom, which had 180,000 cases.  It is not a matter of lack of political, diplomatic or veterinary activity — the record speaks for itself.  There is a direct relationship between BSE cases and difficulties in the markets.  Whenever the incidence of BSE decreases here our exports are more readily accepted.  On Wednesday last our BSE eradication plan was endorsed by the standing veterinary committee, comprised of the chief veterinary officer in each of the 15 member states, in respect of which we will receive refunds from Brussels.  That is an endorsement of ours being the most stringent and effective BSE eradication plan in Europe. ",

        "answerText": " Minister of State at the Department of Justice (Ms Burton):  It is not the practice to comment publicly on individual applicants for refugee status having regard to the fact that applications by their nature are made in confidence with an expectation by applicants that such confidence will be preserved.  However, the person to whom the Deputy refers entered the State on 26 December 1995 and applied to my Department for refugee status on 2 January 1996 under the terms of the 1951 United Nations Convention relating to the Status of Refugees, amended by the 1967 New York Protocol.  I expect a decision on the application will be made in the near future and this decision will be conveyed to the applicant.  The Deputy should note there has been a huge increase in the numbers seeking asylum here which is putting great strain on the process and resulting in long delays. \n Ms O'Donnell:  I thank the Minister for her reply.  I will say nothing that will identify the applicant.  I am sure she will be pleased there will  soon be a determination of her application for asylum given that she has a very sound case.  On the general point, the Minister said there has been an increase in the number of applications for asylum.  I understand that 1,700 cases are awaiting determination.  In the light of the growing numbers of applicants and the number of people awaiting determination of their applications, will the Minister of State comment on recent criticism by the agencies involved and by applicants that the new and updated provisions of our new law, the Refugee Act, which was introduced in June 1996, have not yet been brought into effect and that because of this there is concern that the same ad hoc incomplete resources and conditions for determination of appeals still apply even though we have on the Statute Book new provisions to provide for appeals, etc.?  Can the Minister of State give an assurance that these delays will be alleviated if she ensures that all of the new provisions which will greatly improve the situation for asylum seekers are brought into effect?  What is the reason for the long delay in bringing into effect these much needed provisions of the Refugee Act? \n Ms Burton:  I am happy to tell the Deputy that arrangements are under way to implement the Act.  A series of regulations, including the Dublin Convention, have had to go to the Attorney General's office and also to come before this House. Work is almost complete, but it is quite a complex and technical piece of work and has taken a considerable amount of time.  During the debates on the Refugee Act in this House I made a commitment to come back and have it debated in the House.  I expect it to come before the House next month.  Regarding the increase in the number of applications, in 1992 there were 39 applications for refugee status, in 1995 there were 400 applications, in 1996 there were 1,100 applications and this year there have already been 677 applications. That is a phenomenal increase.  Work is under way at the moment to establish the various offices under the Refugee Act.  In particular, the post of refugee appeals commissioner has been publicly advertised and the interview process for that is under way at the moment under the control of the Civil Service Appointments Commission. We decided to make that appointment by public open competition.  This was done to ensure that all qualified applicants who wished to apply would have access and that it would not be a post by appointment.  I am sure the Deputy welcomes the fact that we have done that, but it does take more time.  As to the other matters, the Office of Public Works is currently obtaining a premises and negotiations are under way with the Department of Finance on the detail of staffing requirements. The phenomenal increase in the numbers applying for refugee status has changed the planning in terms of the number of people required.  In the past six months we have given additional  resources to the UNHCR to cope with the backlog. Under the arrangements of a legal case going back to 1985 all asylum refugee applications in Ireland are referred for their expert advice to the UNHCR under the Geneva Convention.  We have given additional resources to the UNHCR in London to assist in their examination process. Already this year more than 160 asylum applications have been dealt with, whereas two years ago the Department of Justice dealt with fewer than 25 cases a year, and less than ten in some years.  The Deputy should appreciate, therefore, that there has been a huge additional demand for a variety of reasons including the fact that our economy is so successful, making us more attractive to asylum seekers, the international profile of President Robinson, the international profile of Ireland and the fact that in the post-Cold War era there are civil conflicts in many countries as a consequence of which many more people are seeking asylum than was the case ten or 15 years ago.  Inevitably we have to cope with the consequences of that. \n Ms O'Donnell:  Would the Minister not agree that given such an increase in the numbers of people seeking asylum — the 1997 figures indicate about 200 a month — it is vital that we should have our procedures in order to process those applications.  Otherwise we will have a backlog of people awaiting a determination of their applications.  This is distressing for the applicants because they are in a limbo while awaiting determination of their cases.  Also there is a significant cost on the State because during the period of waiting, which at the moment is very long, there is a cost of about £500,000 per 100 asylum seekers per annum, according to a reply given by the Minister to a parliamentary question.  Apart from the humanitarian aspect of providing for a speedy process, there is the cost element of which the Minister cannot be unaware.  Given the increase in the numbers, it is very important to get our procedures in order at the earliest possible opportunity. \n Ms Burton:  The number of applicants at end March this year is 677 which is a considerable increase even on last year.  The cost is substantial, but it will continue to be substantial whether or not a determination is made.  I hope there is no implication in the Deputy's remarks that the determination of an application would result in the person being thrown out of the country and that there would be an end to the cost for the State, because there is an appeals procedure and most applicants choose to exercise their options under it.  The various organisations dealing with refugees have recognised that this State tries to meet its obligations to people who seek asylum here, that we give asylum seekers access to social welfare and the children access to education and health benefits on the same basis as citizens of this State, and that we have introduced what is a fairly compassionate  Refugee Act implementing the Geneva Convention.  I have had discussions with individual refugees and their representatives and, although they come from distressing circumstances and are understandably anxious, there is general recognition that the treatment they receive from officials of the Department of Justice and other agencies dealing with refugees is extremely generous in comparison to many countries.

The SMI steering group has almost completed its consideration of the report of the consultants engaged by it on the SMI review of the Garda Síochána and will shortly be submitting its own report and recommendations to the Government. This will be done, in accordance with the normal process for such reports, through the Department of the Taoiseach. \n Mr. O'Donoghue:  Is the Minister committed to the implementation of the SMI?  Will savings result from it? \n Mrs. Owen:  I have no idea.  The review is being carried out under the chairmanship of a very eminent businessperson and involves a number of other eminent people.

        "answerText": " Mr. Carey  I propose to take Questions Nos. 15, 18 and 32 together.  The National Archives has accommodation needs both short-term and long-term which are in the process of being addressed.  The headquarters of the National Archives is located in premises at Bishop Street in Dublin, but at present not all of those premises is available to it.  The National Archives also still occupies the record repository of the former Public Record Office at the Four Courts in Dublin.  All  the storage space currently available to the National Archives in those two buildings is fully occupied.  Under section 8(1) of the National Archives Act, 1986, Departments of State are obliged to transfer their departmental records to the National Archives to be made available for public inspection when they are 30 years old, unless exempt under other sections of the Act.  Due to shortage of space, the National Archives was unable to accept most of the records for 1966 which were due for transfer by Government Departments in 1966.  It is also at present unable to accept the backlog of older records which are overdue for transfer by the Departments of Education and Finance.  The overall premises at Bishop Street are in principle sufficient to meet the storage requirements of the National Archives until well into the next century.  There are two needs to be addressed, however, before this position is achieved in practice.  The first and more immediate need is to acquire the space available on floor 1 in the front block of the existing premises which is at present occupied by a section of the Government Supplies Agency which is part of the Office of Public Works and, accordingly, the responsibility of the Minister for Finance.  I understand the arrangements being made by the Office of Public Works to allow the vacation of this area have taken longer than envisaged but that urgent attention is being given to the matter to finalise the situation and facilitate its fitting out for National Archives purposes so that it may take in all overdue records including those up to 1967. The second issue relates to proposals for dealing with the longer term accommodation and storage needs of the National Archives.  In this regard the warehouse to the rear of the present building has been identified as offering the optimum solution.  The immediate priority in this regard is the carrying out of planning and preparatory work for this adaptation.  It has been agreed that such adaptation should be undertaken and, in this context, the Minister for Finance announced in the recent budget that the necessary planning and preparatory work for this project will be undertaken by the Office of Public Works in 1997.  On the basis of a feasibility study carried out for the Office of Public Works a total of four options were considered for meeting the future needs of the archives.  The option which would supply the maximum space to the institution has been costed provisionally as being of the order of £13 million at current prices.  The various options are currently the subject of discussions between my Department and the Department of Finance. \n Miss de Valera  Will the Minister outline whether the Government feels there is a need to review the legislation on the National Archives which is now ten years old?  Dr. Garret FitzGerald, a former leader of the Minister's party, warned of the crisis which has arisen with regard  to the National Archives and the need for funding to deal with the matter.  Will the Minister clarify how the Freedom of Information Bill, 1996, when enacted, and the 30 year rule will affect institutions such as the National Archives? \n Mr. Carey  As far as the National Archives Act, 1986 is concerned, there is no specific statutory requirement on the National Archives to provide accommodation for storing archives. Section 8 requires Departments to transfer relevant records which are over 30 years old, and that is Deputy de Valera's point.  Perhaps this matter can be examined to see how the Act can be amended.  As it stands, the Minister may, with the agreement of the director of archives, direct that the transfer of records is not proceeded with until he is satisfied that arrangements for such a transfer are adequate.  The provision meets some of the problems to which the Deputy refers.  Whether the Minister requires further powers should be examined also.  I am unable to answer the Deputy's question about the Freedom of Information Bill, 1996.  I presume that when that Bill was considered the problems of the National Archives were also dealt with. \n Miss de Valera  Perhaps the Minister of State would write to me on the last question. \n Miss Quill  I had a question on the same topic. Will the Minister accept that the Government has made poor provision for storing and availability of the national archives despite all the moneys available to it?  The archives are a quintessentially important part of our heritage.  What is the time frame for making proper provision for, first, storage which is the most important matter and, second, ensuring that archival material is made available for research and other purposes on time and in a manner which makes it accessible to people who want to use archival material?  When will proper provision be made for the National Archives at Bishop's Street? \n Mr. Carey  The Minister for Finance made provision in this year's budget for preparatory work for the National Archive project and that is a first step.  It is ten years since that Act was introduced and there has been inactivity since then.  At least something is under way now.  A feasibility study is being carried out by the Office of Public Works and a total of four options were considered.  The various options are being discussed by the Department and the Department of Finance and we await the outcome. \n Miss Quill  When is the consultation process likely to be completed?  When is the work on the extension and refurbishment of premises likely to commence? \n Mr. Carey  The Office of Public Works has been directed to have all preparatory work completed in 1997 so I am sure there will be a resolution of this matter late this year or early in 1998.

Íocann mo Roinnse deontas faoi Scéim na bhFoghlaimeoirí Gaeilge le teaghlaigh Ghaeltachta a choinníonn foghlaimeoirí Gaeilge ar iostas, le linn dóibh a bheith ag freastal ar chúrsaí aitheanta sna coláistí Gaeilge samhraidh sa Ghaeltacht.  Cabhraíonn an deontas seo go mór chun na táillí a ghearrann na coláistí ar thuismitheoirí na bhfoghlaimeoirí a choimeád chomh híseal agus is féidir.  Sa bhliain 1995 rinneadh méadú substaintiúil ar an deontas ó £3.50 go dtí £4 in aghaidh an scoláire in aghaidh an lae agus níl sé i gceist agam cur leis an gcabhair sin, a chosnaíonn beagnach £2 milliún in aghaidh na bliana, ag an bpointe seo. \n Miss Quill  An bhfuil an tAire sásta go bhfuil dóthain déanta ag an Ríaltas chun cúnamh speisíalta a thabhairt do leanaí óga ó theaghlaigh ar bheagán airgid chun freastal ar choláistí samhraidh?  Muna bhfuil, an bhfuil aon scéim nua á beartú ag an Ríaltas chun cabhrú lena leithéid de leanaí? \n Mr. Carey  Tá dul chun cinn mór déanta ag an scéim atá ann i láthair na huaire.  Bhí 18,725 dalta ag freastal ar an scéim i 1990 agus 22,580 dalta ag freastal air i 1996.  Táim sásta go bhfuil sé ag obair go líofa. \n Éamon Ó Cuív  Is dóigh liom nár thuig an t-Aire an cheist.  Tá a fhios againn go bhfuil 18,000 gasúr ag dul chuig na Gaeltachta chuile bhliain agus go dtugann an Roinn cúnamh do chuile gasúr a théann go dtí an Ghaeltacht.  Ach duine ar bith a bhíonn ag plé le coláistí Gaeilge, tuigeann go dtagann bunáite na ngasúr a théann go dtí an Ghaeltacht as teaghlaigh meán-aicmeach nó níos airde.  An bhfuil i gceist cúnamh faoi leith a thabhairt do ghasúir ó theaghlaigh ar bheagán airgid ag dul go dtí an Ghaeltacht?  Fadó, nuair a thosaigh an scéim seo, bhí coiste na bpáistí ann ag na ceardchumainn agus cuireadh deireadh leis sin.  Faraor gurb ag na páirtithe polaitíochta a chuirtear an t-airgead anois agus ní chun gasúir a chur chun na Gaeltachta.  Bíodh sin mar atá.  Bhíodh na coistí gairmoideachais ag cur roinnt gasúr go dtí na Gaeltachtaí ach le blianta beaga tá titim air sin.  An mbeadh an tAire i bhfábhar airgead speisialta a chur ar fáil, b'fhéidir tríd na coistí gairmoideachais, le cúnamh speisialta a thabhairt do ghasúir nach bhfuil £200 nó £300 acu le dul go dtí na Gaeltachta: ciste mar sin a chur ar fáil chun na críche seo? \n Mr. Carey  Sin ceist don Roinn Oideachais. Iarrfaidh mise ar an Aire Oideachais ciste a chur chuig na coistí gairmoideachais chun an chabhair sin a chur ar fáil do dhaoine bochta. \n Éamon Ó Cuív  Le fada an lá, tá scrúdú á dhéanamh ag an dá Roinn ar cheist na gcoláistí Gaeilge.  Ar cuireadh an cheist seo san áireamh sa staidéar sin? \n Mr. Carey  Dhein an coiste sin scrúdú ar gach rud a bhaineann le cothú na Gaeilge.  Tá an Roinn sásta go bhfuil dul chun cinn déanta faoin scéim atá ann i láthair na huaire agus níl aon mholtaí agam chun é a athrú. \n Mr. Molloy  Ní raibh mé anseo don bhfreagra ach glacaim leis go ndúirt an tAire nach raibh aon phleananna aige chuige seo agus mar sin an nglacfadh sé leis gurb é ceann de na rudaí ab fhiúntaí a fhéadfaí a dhéanamh ábaltacht i nGaeilge a thabhairt do pháistí trí sheans a thabhairt dóibh freastal ar choláiste samhraidh?  Ní féidir le anchuid páistí a thagann ó teaghlaigh ar bheagán ioncaim úsáid a bhaint as na coláistí de bharr an chostais atá orthu.  Dá mbeadh polasaí ceart ag an Rialtas, dhíreofaí ar na páistí sin ionas nach bhfágfaí as an áíreamh iad. \n Mr. Carey  De réir m'eolais agus Comhchoiste Náisiúnta na gColáístí Samhraidh, tá scoláireachtaí le fáil ó eagrais éagsúla chun cuidiú le daltaí freastal ar choláistí samhraidh ar choinníollacha áirithe.  Is iad na heagrais na Coiste Áitiúil Ghlór na nGael, coistí gairmoideachais, an Garda Síochána, na ceardchumainn, TEU.  Mandate, Impact, Irish Print Union, AWEU, Siptu.  Dar le Concas freisin, cuireann roinnt cumainn agus comhlachtaí áitiúla scoláireachtaí ar fáil dá mball. \n Éamon Ó Cuív  Ar cuireadh an t-eolas ar fáil don Aire Stáit cé mhéad scoláireachtaí san iomlán atá i gceist anseo?  Táimid ag caint ar 88,000 gasúr ag dul chun na Gaeltachta.  Cé mhéad acu sin a théann ar scoláireacht? \n Mr. Carey  Níl an t-eolas cruinn sin agam. \n Éamon Ó Cuív  An nglacfadh an tAire Stáit leis go bhfui chuile sheans ann gur figiúir an-bheag atá i gceist? \n Mr. Carey  Ní ghlacaim. \n Miss Quill  Níl an t-eolas ag an Aire. \n Mr. Molloy  Seo é an tarna uair gur chuir mé síos ceist den sórt seo agus níl sé sásúil nach eolas níos cruinne ag an Aire Stáit faoi Scéim na gColáistí Samhraidh.  Nach fíor gur líon an-bheag páistí a bhaineann scoláireacht amach agus go bhfuil formhór na bpáistí ó theaghlaigh ar bheagán ioncaim gan a bheith in ann dul?  Nílim ag iarraidh ar an Aire ach aontú liom; nílimid ag dul ar aghaidh más ar nós cuma liom atá na tAire faoi. \n Mr. Carey  Níl eolas cruinn agam ina thaobh ach déanfaidh mé iarracht an t-eolas a fháil.

The National Archives has accommodation needs both short-term and long-term which are in the process of being addressed.  The headquarters of the National Archives is located in premises at Bishop Street in Dublin, but at present not all of those premises is available to it.  The National Archives also still occupies the record repository of the former Public Record Office at the Four Courts in Dublin.  All  the storage space currently available to the National Archives in those two buildings is fully occupied.  Under section 8(1) of the National Archives Act, 1986, Departments of State are obliged to transfer their departmental records to the National Archives to be made available for public inspection when they are 30 years old, unless exempt under other sections of the Act.

It is also at present unable to accept the backlog of older records which are overdue for transfer by the Departments of Education and Finance.  The overall premises at Bishop Street are in principle sufficient to meet the storage requirements of the National Archives until well into the next century.  There are two needs to be addressed, however, before this position is achieved in practice.  The first and more immediate need is to acquire the space available on floor 1 in the front block of the existing premises which is at present occupied by a section of the Government Supplies Agency which is part of the Office of Public Works and, accordingly, the responsibility of the Minister for Finance.

The second issue relates to proposals for dealing with the longer term accommodation and storage needs of the National Archives.  In this regard the warehouse to the rear of the present building has been identified as offering the optimum solution.  The immediate priority in this regard is the carrying out of planning and preparatory work for this adaptation.  It has been agreed that such adaptation should be undertaken and, in this context, the Minister for Finance announced in the recent budget that the necessary planning and preparatory work for this project will be undertaken by the Office of Public Works in 1997.  On the basis of a feasibility study carried out for the Office of Public Works a total of four options were considered for meeting the future needs of the archives.  The option which would supply the maximum space to the institution has been costed provisionally as being of the order of £13 million at current prices.  The various options are currently the subject of discussions between my Department and the Department of Finance. \n Miss de Valera  Will the Minister outline whether the Government feels there is a need to review the legislation on the National Archives which is now ten years old?  Dr. Garret FitzGerald, a former leader of the Minister's party, warned of the crisis which has arisen with regard  to the National Archives and the need for funding to deal with the matter.  Will the Minister clarify how the Freedom of Information Bill, 1996, when enacted, and the 30 year rule will affect institutions such as the National Archives? \n Mr. Carey  As far as the National Archives Act, 1986 is concerned, there is no specific statutory requirement on the National Archives to provide accommodation for storing archives. Section 8 requires Departments to transfer relevant records which are over 30 years old, and that is Deputy de Valera's point.  Perhaps this matter can be examined to see how the Act can be amended.  As it stands, the Minister may, with the agreement of the director of archives, direct that the transfer of records is not proceeded with until he is satisfied that arrangements for such a transfer are adequate.  The provision meets some of the problems to which the Deputy refers.  Whether the Minister requires further powers should be examined also.  I am unable to answer the Deputy's question about the Freedom of Information Bill, 1996.  I presume that when that Bill was considered the problems of the National Archives were also dealt with. \n Miss de Valera  Perhaps the Minister of State would write to me on the last question. \n Miss Quill  I had a question on the same topic. Will the Minister accept that the Government has made poor provision for storing and availability of the national archives despite all the moneys available to it?  The archives are a quintessentially important part of our heritage.  What is the time frame for making proper provision for, first, storage which is the most important matter and, second, ensuring that archival material is made available for research and other purposes on time and in a manner which makes it accessible to people who want to use archival material?  When will proper provision be made for the National Archives at Bishop's Street? \n Mr. Carey  The Minister for Finance made provision in this year's budget for preparatory work for the National Archive project and that is a first step.  It is ten years since that Act was introduced and there has been inactivity since then.  At least something is under way now.  A feasibility study is being carried out by the Office of Public Works and a total of four options were considered.  The various options are being discussed by the Department and the Department of Finance and we await the outcome. \n Miss Quill  When is the consultation process likely to be completed?  When is the work on the extension and refurbishment of premises likely to commence? \n Mr. Carey  The Office of Public Works has been directed to have all preparatory work completed in 1997 so I am sure there will be a resolution of this matter late this year or early in 1998.

        "answerText": " Minister for Finance (Mr. Quinn)  I propose to take Questions Nos. 1 and 3 together.  As I indicated in my Budget Statement, the Government is studying the appropriate corporation tax structure for the long-term, bearing in mind the importance of the 10 per cent rate for inward investment and the International Financial Services Centre.  I am conscious of the need to clarify this issue at an early date and I hope to be in a position to make an announcement in due course.  Under present legislation, the 10 per cent rate is due to continue until the end of 2005 in the case of the IFSC and until the end of 2010 in the case of manufacturing industry generally.  The primary objective of the review which is currently under way is to provide for a corporation tax structure after these deadlines which will ensure that Ireland remains a competitive location for  internationally mobile investment.  The review will also take due account of the importance of maintaining the very constructive and good relations which we have enjoyed with our tax treaty partners abroad.  The particular concerns which other EU member states have raised up to now in regard to our existing corporate tax regime have been addressed generally in the context of the established tax treaty provisions with such countries and it is intended that this will continue to be the case in so far as the tax regime post 2005 and 2010 is concerned. \n Mr. McCreevy  This matter concerns a large number of companies and I am sure the Minister received representations from IBEC in this regard.  Large multinationals make decisions years in advance and some industries have a long lead-in timescale.  While the years 2005 and 2010 may appear to be a long time away for many of us, that is not the case for multinational companies who must start planning now for those years. What is the Government's strategy on this matter? Will it approach the Commission on the basis that it can be decided under our taxation policy or will the concerns of the Commission and other countries, who regard our tax structure as a State aid, be taken into account? \n Mr. Quinn  Two separate but related tax rates apply.  The rate that will apply up to 2005, with specific reference to SFADCo and the IFSC, is regarded by the Commission as a State aid and a derogation was obtained.  The general rate of 10 per cent for manufacturing and internationally traded services is not a State aid.  It has been our rate of corporation tax for many years.  We are conscious of the concerns in the multinational and indigenous sectors and of the demands from non-10 per cent paying companies to address the issue to facilitate medium to long-term planning. We are in the process of formulating a strategy but have not yet concluded its components. \n Mr. M. McDowell  Is the Minister's phrase \"in due course\" radically different from \"in the next two months\" which I read in the newspapers recently in terms of when a document in this regard will be published?  Does he agree it is important, as IBEC has suggested, to show incoming industry that we are committed to applying rates as close as possible to the current base rate?  Does he agree we must engage in a substantial overhaul of the ordinary corporation tax rate to place ourselves within shouting distance of a uniform rate that would not be significantly different from the rates that already obtain? \n Mr. Quinn  I hope \"in due course\" is as soon as possible.  As I believe in forward planning, I would like to be in a position to publish the document in two months.  Irrespective of the final position, our objective is to apply a corporate tax rate as close as possible to the current base rate of 10  per cent.  Corporation tax has been reduced by one-third for more than 50 per cent of companies who paid 40 per cent corporation tax when the Deputy's party was last in office.  The tax rate that applies to companies reporting profits of £50,000 or less will reduce to 28 per cent after 6 April.  In the course of three budgets we have reduced the corporate tax rate by one-third for primarily small and medium sized Irish companies.  We are moving in the right direction and I would like to maintain that momentum. \n Mr. McCreevy  Like other Ministers, I note the Minister for Finance has commenced his election campaign. \n Mr. Quinn  One never stops campaigning. \n Mr. McCreevy  It would be a foolish politician who would.  Has the Minister noted recent comments by the German Finance Minister, and others, who are casting envious glances at our corporation tax rate?  The German Minister for Finance more or less implied that the matter should be considered as part of European Monetary Union discussions?  He wants the matter examined in the short-term.  This has sounded alarm bells for people who invest here as well those who operate here.  I urge the Minister to review the matter as quickly as possible and give clear signals in this regard.  As large numbers of people are employed by these companies, the matter is of national importance. \n Mr. Quinn  The comments of my colleague, the German Minister for Finance, should be set in the context of the domestic politics in Germany.  A coalition of parties, that included his, defeated my sister party, the SPD, on a claim that Germany could be reunified without increasing taxes.  That proved a lie for the Conservative Party in Britain and, consequently, corporate and general taxation rates in Germany are high.  They are now trying to address that problem and, in doing so, referring to other European Union countries.  I accept the validity of the claim of prospective investors already located here who are contemplating expansion and the indigenous sector, both the 10 per cent and the non-10 per cent, that they need some sense of certainty in so far as any Government can provide it.  It is my intention to provide that and I would like to be in a position to do it within two months or something of that order, but within a short timeframe, not an openended one. \n Mr. M. McDowell  Does the Minister agree that the deadline of 2005 must be urgently addressed?  Having a standard Irish tax rate of 10 per cent for financial services could be one way of dealing with the domestic and international financial service markets.  In that context, does the European Union regard the 10 per cent manufacturing rate as a  matter which need not be addressed on an EU level in 2010, except in the context of the general alignment of tax rates?  Is it, therefore, possible that we could have a general tax rate of 10 per cent on financial services in the Irish economy from 2005 onwards?  Is that one way of addressing that problem without prejudice to the general issue of what happens five years later? \n Mr. Quinn  The 10 per cent rate which applies to the IFSC and Shannon, where the level of activity is small, is specifically recognised by the Commission as a State aid.  The status of the 2010 deadline is in a different category.  I would have to take advice and examine the implications of what the Deputy proposes.  As we move closer to market harmonisation, the Commission would have a strong view on all taxation issues. ",

        "answerText": " Mr. Quinn  I propose to take Questions Nos. 6 and 27 together.  In the current tax year 1996-97 it is estimated that a single employee, full rate PRSI contributor, earning the average industrial wage, will pay almost 29.3 per cent of his or her earnings in income tax, PRSI and levies.  This is referred to as the average tax burden.  Such a taxpayer will pay the 48 per cent income tax rate on £1,719 of his or her earnings and PRSI on £10,409.  A single self-employed taxpayer, on the same income level, will pay 32.6 per cent of his or her earnings in income tax, PRSI and levies.  The self-employed taxpayer will pay the 48 per cent income tax rate on £2,519 of his or her earnings and PRSI on £13,529.  As a result of the improvements announced in this year's budget, it is estimated that the average tax burden for a single employee on the average industrial wage will fall to below 27.2 per cent in 1997-98, even after allowing for wage increases. The amount of his or her income subject to the 48 per cent income tax rate will decline to £1,406. For a single self-employed taxpayer the comparative figures are 31.1 per cent and £2,206.  The Government's policy in relation to taxation is set out in the programme for renewal. The programme stresses the need to reform the tax system, in particular to relieve the tax and PRSI burden of those on low incomes.  Tax reform will favour the incentive to work, tackle the poverty trap, aim to reduce the tax wedge and encourage enterprise development.  The Deputy will also be aware that section 3.9 of Partnership 2000 states: \"The Government will introduce personal tax reductions to the cumulative value over the three years of £900 million on a full year cost basis\".  The first steps towards implementing this undertaking were taken in my recent budget.  The measures introduced include increasing personal allowances by £250 in the case of a single person and £500 for a married couple, the largest increase in personal allowances since 1984; increasing the general income exemption limits by £100 single and £200 married; reducing the standard income tax rate by 1 per cent to 26 per cent; widening the standard rate tax band by £500 single and £1,000 married; reducing by 1 per cent the employee full rate PRSI contribution, which is paid by slightly over 70 per cent of PRSI contributors; increasing the income threshold for payment of the health and employment and training  levies by £500 to £10,250 or to £197 per week. These measures will continue to reduce the tax and PRSI burden on employment and the average tax wedge, thereby making employment more attractive.  Of course more needs to be done, and it is the Government's policy to continue, within responsible budgetary parameters, the process of reducing the tax and PRSI burden on earned income as an important element in overall strategy.  The personal tax reductions introduced in this year's budget amount to £393 million on a full year cost basis.  The remainder of the £900 million agreed for personal tax reductions under Partnership 2000 will be provided in the 1998 and 1999 budgets. The precise measures to be introduced in those two budgets are, of course, a matter for consideration by the Government in the run up to each of those two budgets. \n Mr. M. McDowell  I am grateful to the Minister for providing those figures and also for the unusually non-propagandistic way in which they were delivered on this occasion.  I thought I would hear about what happened in 1989-1992, which normally happens when we discuss these matters. \n Mr. Quinn  I do not believe in kicking people when they are down. \n Mr. M. McDowell  I will reciprocate in coming months.  Is the cost of the 1 per cent reduction in PRSI, which affects 70 per cent of PRSI payers, included in the £900 million tax package; in other words, is PRSI now considered to be a tax?  If so, it amounts to a confirmation for the first time that it is a tax.  In this context, is it not alarming that a self-employed person — we are supposed to be in favour of self-employment, although we sometimes forget this — earning the average industrial wage is asked to give one third of his or her income in taxes and that there is such a significant differential compared with an ordinary PAYE employee?  While we are always told the self-employed person has the advantage in being able to put his or her money aside and pay his or her tax at the end of the year — this is not such a huge advantage — will the Minister agree that, in order to calculate their tax bill, many self-employed persons have to pay a significant amount of money to accountants?  This is an additional cost. \n Mr. Quinn  This is subject to confirmation but I think the cost of the PRSI reductions is included in the £900 million tax package.  I will communicate directly with the Deputy on that point.  With the assistance of professional accountants, self-employed persons have much greater flexibility in offsetting—— \n Mr. M. McDowell  They have to pay for it. \n Mr. Quinn  It may be deductible. \n Mr. M. McDowell  It has to be paid for. \n Mr. Quinn  In identifying their taxable income the accountant will seek offsets against their gross income.  This is not a facility an employed person can avail of.  Self-employment activities range across a wide spectrum of vocations and professions while the potential for offsets and imputed costs varies significantly.  I am not a professional accountant and cannot offer an informed view but that may be one explanation for the differential. \n Mr. M. McDowell  I am not living on a different planet.  I fully accept that self-employed status is generally considered to be more advantageous than PAYE employee status. \n Mr. Quinn  Provided one does not get sick. \n Mr. M. McDowell  That is the point.  To take 30 to 33 per cent in taxes and PRSI from somebody earning the average industrial wage, be they self-employed or employed, is a huge reduction. Assuming the cost of the 1 per cent reduction in PRSI is included in the tax package, will the Minister agree the logic is to keep hacking away until PRSI is removed?  If it does not amount to social welfare insurance, as the Minister for Social Welfare, Deputy De Rossa, argues it is, but a tax, it is the most regressive employment tax in the State. \n Mr. Quinn  That ought be the subject of a wider and deeper debate but a person on the average industrial wage, be he self-employed or otherwise, with no other source of income and availing of the array of facilities and benefits on offer, in contrast with any other OECD country, is getting a good deal.  In the United States one has to impute local property taxes, local state taxes—— \n Mr. M. McDowell  The average industrial wage in the United States is much higher. \n Mr. Quinn  That may well be the case but the quality of primary schools, primary health care, housing and a range of other items is not the same.  I am aware one cannot factor in numbers and figures for quality of life considerations which are a matter of perception depending on where an individual lives and so on, but am I right in thinking the Progressive Democrats — the Deputy is their official spokesperson on Finance — would like to drive down the figure even more?  The Deputy asked me earlier to drive down the level of corporation tax.  That, presumably, implies a forfeiture of revenue, if not in the long-term, in the short-term.  If one drives down the level of corporation tax and personal income tax rates, where would the consequences be felt in the provision of services? \n Mr. M. McDowell  I am flattered to be asked questions by the Minister for Finance at Question Time, I hope it is an augury of things to come. \n Mr. Quinn  I am exposing the bankruptcy of the Deputy's logic. \n Mr. M. McDowell  Will the Minister accept there must be reductions in both corporate and personal taxation?  One is not the enemy of the other.  Reductions in both are needed to bring about an enterprise economy. \n Mr. Quinn  Every time the Progressive Democrats look for more prison warders and more child care workers and every other item of expenditure, which they do consistently—— \n Mr. M. McDowell  We have never demanded more prison warders. \n Mr. Quinn  ——I will repeat to the various spokespersons, including their leader, the Deputy's reply. \n Mr. Cullen  Will the Minister accept that it is now almost beyond the capacity of young couples earning £13,000 to £14,000 — this is not a luxury income — who are paying the top rate of tax to provide for their health care and housing needs out of their own pockets and that the State is taking more responsibility?  This is a move in the wrong direction and is unsustainable.  Unless we begin to bring down the top rate of tax we will make it impossible for young couples to provide for their needs because of the high levels of tax they have to pay. \n Mr. Quinn  While I accept that all sectors of society are demanding that the State should do and pay more to those providing services, I do not accept that the State is trying to take on more responsibility.

        "answerText": " Mr. M. Higgins  Tógfaidh mé Ceisteanna Uimh.  6, 7, 9, 10, 13 agus 18 le chéile.  Cé go bhfuil cuid de na ceisteanna seo i nGaeilge agus cuid eile i mBéarla, tá i gceist agam an freagra a thabhairt sa chéad áit i mBéarla.  Beidh mé lán-sásta, ar ndóigh, ceisteanna forlíontacha a fhreagairt i gceachtar den dá theanga, de réir mar a oireann do Theachtaí.  I am aware of the concerns of the farming community about the transposition into Irish law of Directive 92/43/EEC and the subsequent designation of special areas of conservation — SACs — and I have received representations from the Connemara IFA among others in the matter. Directive 92/43/EEC was due to be implemented in Ireland in June 1994.  However, despite the fact that we are already behind schedule and because of the possible institution of legal proceedings by the EU Commission, I have undertaken not to bring the directive into effect until February 1997, to ensure adequate time is given to consultations in respect of the compensation requirements and the proposals in general.  Before any designation of special areas of conservation occurs there will be full consultation. There has already been substantial consultation with farm organisations and this week with a number of local authorities.  All land owners and land users, identified as having land included in the sites, will be provided with a site map, site description and details of the conditions applying to the site.  There is no question of land being impounded, as suggested in one of the questions. The restrictions arising, if any, will be the minimum that will achieve the conservation of the site.  For example, the conditions applied to blanket  bogs, heaths, upland grasslands and to the Burren will be identical to those already agreed by the farming organisations for REPS in proposed natural heritage areas.  These prescriptions for environmentally friendly farming for twothirds of the areas involved have already been agreed with farming organisations.  Other prescriptions will be discussed and agreed in the same way.  Farmers who are farming their lands in a sustainable manner will not need to make changes.  The sites have been selected on the criteria required under the habitats directive and the directive allows only for the consideration of scientific objections to designation.  The cost of objections will vary from case to case and the question of how these costs should be borne is the subject of ongoing discussions with the farming organisations.  Maps of the special areas of conservation will be published when the directive comes into effect.  I am pleased to inform the Deputies that the Government is agreeable as part of a new programme replacing the current PCW to pay a fair and proper level of compensation, having regard to the level and extent of restrictions and all reasonable losses arising as a result of the SAC designations.  I shall appoint an independent arbitrator to adjudicate on disputes in relation to the level of compensation.  In the interest of equity I will be proposing that the State should bear the cost of the arbitrator.  Natural heritage areas are still only at the proposal stage.  There will be no designation until new legislation has been introduced and passed by the Oireachtas.  There will be provisions for full consultation in the Wildlife (Amendment) Bill, 1997. \n Mr. Molloy  Is the Minister aware of the widespread concern and anger among farmers, who live where the national heritage areas have been designated or are proposed to be designated and where the conservation areas are most likely to come into effect, about the absence of specific information relating to the individual farmer which would indicate what area of his land would be included, what restrictions would be placed on his farming practices, the likely effect on his income and the provisions to compensate him for any loss arising from the restrictions?  The anger arises from the lack of real information available to individual land owners.  In view of this point, which the Minister did not address, I ask him to postpone the transposition of this directive into Irish law until maps are made available to farmers, all these questions are adequately answered, a proper consultation process is available for individual farmers as distinct from the organisations representing them and details of compensation are supplied. \n An Ceann Comhairle  That is adequate for the time being, Deputy Molloy. \n Mr. Molloy  There are a number of questions. \n Mr. M. Higgins  I am anxious to give the maximum information to the Deputy and the public.  It is some time since I met the representatives of the Irish Farmers' Association, Connemara branch, in Galway, when we discussed a number of the issues to which I referred in my reply. Today we are distributing to all Deputies, Senators and public representatives a booklet written in Irish and English called Farming in Nature , which sets out the basis, background and procedures taking place.  I will give an example because I want to be as positive as possible about the information sought by the Deputy.  It is my hope that the maps will be distributed before February but I have to confirm how far that has progressed technically.  On objections to designation there will be an appeals mechanism — that was one point about which the farming organisations were concerned.  That will include a farming representative, a representative of conservation interests and an independent chair.  After designation, where there is disagreement on the level of compensation, for example, it will be decided by an arbitrator who will be independent of the Minister.  Then, as a gesture to make sure that mechanism of appeal for compensation will be fair, the cost will be borne by the Department.  It may be helpful to note that in most cases — perhaps as many as 70 per cent — agreements already exist within the REPS mechanism.  One then comes to the remaining cases, about which there will be discussion and debate at different meetings.  Where there is no danger or where existing practices are sustainable there will be no problem.  One is then left with the smaller proportion where there is a threat to sustainability, in which case the person can use the informal mechanism of approaching the ranger, who will bring up any opinions, or he may invoke the formal appeal mechanism which we have put in place.  If there must be a change of practice and the compensation level is disputed, there will be an independent arbitrator, the cost of whom will be borne by the Department. \n Éamon Ó Cuív  An consultation atá i gceist mar an Ghaeilge a chuirfinn ar \"consultation\" ná \"dul i gcomhairle\" nó \"comhairle a ghlacadh\".  Is dóigh liom nach bhfuiltear ag glacach comhairle na bhfeirmeoirí, go bhfuil siad dá gcur ar an eolas faoi rud atá réamh-shocraithe ag an Roinn. Ciallaíonn \"comhairle a ghlacadh\" ná go nglactar leis an gcomhairle agus go ndéantar cinní air.  An bhfuil i gceist ag an Aire a dhul i gcomhairle leis an Teach seo nó le coiste de chuid an Tí seo tar éis na rialacháin agus an pacáiste compensation a bheith foilsithe, agus sula dtiocfaidh na rialacháin seo i bhfeidhm ó tharla gurb iad atá ionadaíoch don phobal uilig, na feirmeoirí ar fad ina measc?  Tá ceist an chúitimh an-tábhachtach.  Maidir le cúiteamh, an féidir leis an Aire a dheimhniú nach mbeidh aon chúiteamh as caillteanas deontaisí?  Is é sin a rá nach mbeidh cúiteamh le fáil, mar shampla, ag na daoine sna ceantair  seo ar dheontaisí caorach a mbíodh siad in ann a fháil, nó deontaisí foraoiseachta.  An nglacadh an tAire leis nó an admhódh sé nach mairfidh an scéim REPS go deo, agus mar atá rudaí i láthair na huaire, nach bhfuil ach trí bliana le dul ar an scéim REPS agus cad a tharlóidh ina dhiaidh sin?  Ní fios ach go mbeidh an rialachán seo ann go deo. \n Mr. M. Higgins  Tabhairfaidh mé freagra chomh sciopthe agus chomh díreach agus is féidir liom.  Maidir leis an gceist dheireannach, tuigim go mbeidh deireadh leis an scéim REPS mar atá sé faoi láthair taobh istigh de thrí bhliain.  Tá mé lán cinnte, ó na cainteanna a bhí agam féin le mo chomhleacaí, an tAire Talmhaíochta, Bia agus Foraoiseachta, go mbeadh scéim ag teacht in áit an scéim atá ann faoi láthair. \n Éamon Ó Cuív  Pig in a poke. \n Mr. M. Higgins  Maidir leis an gceist eile, caithfidh mé cloí leis an dlí mar atá sé faoin gcomhbhonntreoir atá ann ón gComhphobal, na directives.  Tá sé leagtha síos an bonn ar ar féidir cúiteamh a chur ar fáil.  Tá cainteanna ar siúl faoi sin agus leanfaidh siad leis na heagrais atá ag plé le cúrsaí talmhaíochta. \n Éamon Ó Cuív  Freagair an cheist, níl cúis ar fáil. \n Mr. M. Higgins  Maidir leis an gcéad cheann, thug an Teachta ceacht bheag ar an bhrí atá le \"comhairle\".  Ní amháin go raibh cruinniú agam leis na feirmeoirí i gcathair na Gaillimhe, is é sin craobh Chonamara den IFA, ach chomh maith le sin i nDáil Éireann ar leibhéal náisiúnta bhí cruinnithe ag mo oifigigh agus oifigigh éagsúla an ICMSA, an IFA agus leis an Roinn Talmhaíochta, Bia agus Foraoiseachta.  Bhí cruinniú inné i gCorcaigh, i Nenagh agus in áiteanna mar sin.  Leanfaidh na cruinnuithe sin agus is féidir liom a rá gur tháinig a lán de na moltaí a léirigh mé ós comhair an Tí trathnóna as na cruinnithe sin leis na heagrais i gceist. \n Mr. Molloy  It is disappointing that the Minister has not answered some of the specific questions I put to him.  As is shown on these maps—— \n An Ceann Comhairle  Gan aon taispeántas. \n Mr. Molloy  ——practically three-quarters of the constituency of Galway West is proposed to be designated as a national heritage area.  Nearly all of Connemara is included.  All the farmers living in those areas are being left in the dark with regard to the effect this will have on their ability to continue their farming enterprise and practices in that region.  The Minister says he met the Connemara branch of the IFA but that was quite some time ago.  He did not attend a major meeting held in Galway a number of weeks ago when this matter was under discussion.  We will not be shown maps of the area, the land designations or  the areas of land to be impounded.  We do not know the work required for each farmer or the cost of our scientific appeal—— \n An Ceann Comhairle  The Deputy seems to be quoting.  That is not in order. \n Mr. Molloy  ——until after this law is brought into operation.  The Minister must accept that the details of the appeals mechanism he refers to are not sufficiently clear to allay the fears of farmers. He said the appeal must be scientifically based but how can a farmer on a poor holding in Connemara afford the expense of having a scientific appeal prepared against the designation of his farm?  Will farmers have to pay for the preservation of these areas or is it not more properly a matter for society to pay through proper, adequate, permanent compensation for farmers arising out of the possible loss of the opportunity to gain an income from their holding? \n An Ceann Comhairle  Let us hear the Minister's reply. \n Mr. Carey  It is a long speech. \n Mr. Molloy  These issues are not being addressed.  I ask the Minister to postpone the transposition of this directive into Irish law for at least six months until all these issues have been satisfactorily resolved. \n Mr. M. Higgins  One must first draw a distinction between the NHAs and the SACs.  In relation to national heritage areas, enabling legislation will be the Wildlife (Amendment) Bill, 1997, which I hope to introduce early in 1997.  On the special areas of conservation which are a subset of the larger NHAs, a number of farmers in those areas are already practising farming under the REP scheme.  I am sure the Deputy is not suggesting a division between ecological concern and farming, but farmers are anxious to practise responsible farming in a changed way.  Sustainability is under threat in the special areas of conservation.  The meetings with farmers have been useful and have been followed with meetings at which agreement was reached on stocking levels in relation to sheep in mountainous areas where whole sides of mountains had deteriorated. Proposals came from the farmers as to how they might be managed and they were accepted.  The details of how the appeal scheme might work arose from talks.  I had a meeting at which I suggested that in circumstances where a farmer in an area of special conservation has trained a member of his family to farm in a particular way, and that person must now be retrained, there might be an ex gratia power to deal with such exceptions.  We have so far supplied all the information sought by the IFA.  I intend to have more meetings around the country and to provide all the information requested.  It would be wrong to think we had to make a  choice between responsible ecological management, in which I believe farmers want to play a lead role as they are closest to the land, and practices that put sustainability at risk.  We will be able to provide all the information people want and we will continue to place advertisements and hold seminars and meetings.  In relation to maps and designations, I will try to ensure these are made available at local offices for consultation. \n Mr. Nealon  I felt I had to come into the House this evening to dilute the virtual Clare-Galway monopoly of the House. \n Mr. Molloy  I do not see any questions down from the Deputy. \n Mr. Nealon  I am about to put one that is more direct and better than those put by the Deputy, and in a shorter time.  As the Minister is aware, in certain circumstances where agreement cannot be reached on development in national heritage areas, the State may have to purchase the property. Will the Minister outline the criteria that will be used in the valuation?  Will the valuation be based on the existing undeveloped situation or on the potential after development?  Also, what does the Minister propose to do with the properties taken over by the State? \n Mr. Molloy  Even the Government backbenchers do not know, so how are the farmers supposed to know? \n Mr. M. Higgins  I agree with Deputy Molloy that his party took a greater interest in this Question Time than any other party; that is the reason seven of its members tabled the same question. \n Mr. Molloy  We had to make sure it was reached.  We have a lottery system here. \n Mr. M. Higgins  To answer Deputy Nealon's question, the enabling legislation which I hope will be the Wildlife (Amendment) Act, 1997 — I am equally confident of getting that Bill through the House before I disappear — places a minimal disadvantage in relation to designation because it is a requirement to give notice of a proposed usage, and the delay which might ensue would be approximately six months.  The difference between the special areas of conservation and the NHAs is that a special area of conservation, constructed on the legal basis of the directives, is such as to say a person may have to cease an activity if that activity contravened sustainability. It seemed reasonable, therefore, that there was a clear case for compensation for having to cease or redirect activity in special areas of conservation. The same case does not apply in relation to NHAs.  If, however, a great deal of the territory comprising NHAs already falls within State ownership, the manner in which the State would acquire property would be in accordance with the procedures that prevailed up to now. \n Miss de Valera  I welcome the Minister's Uturn on the proposed SACs and the habitats directive because on 8 October we were told that the directive was to be signed within one month. We now have a stay on that thanks to the Fianna Fáil Private Members' motion on this issue.  The Minister will remember the advertisements he placed in the national newspapers the day that Private Members' motion was debated.  Will the Minister tell us the cost of those advertisements? Does the Minister not accept that was a damage limitation exercise?  Furthermore, consultation is not consultation if it is retrospective.  Consultation is extremely important both with farming and other groups.  Will the Minister accept it is important that such discussions take place in the Oireachtas as well as with lobby groups and individuals seeking further information? \n Mr. M. Higgins  The Fianna Fáil Private Members' motion provided me with an opportunity of outlining the eight occasions on which I had already met the farming organisations.  The advertisements had been booked before I saw that motion. \n Miss de Valera  I had asked the Minister a number of times in the House before the Private Members' motion. \n Mr. M. Higgins  As regards the cost of the advertisements, I do not have that information before me; it will be my pleasure to send it to the Deputy for Christmas. \n Miss de Valera  I thank the Minister. \n Mr. M. Higgins  I reject the idea that placing the advertisements was a damage limitation exercise. The notion that consultations were not held prior to the Private Members' motion being debated is untrue.  The eight occasions on which I met the farming organisations are on record. \n Miss de Valera  Why is there such confusion among the general public? \n Mr. M. Higgins  The Deputy would know much more about that than I do because she seems to talk about it a great deal. \n Miss de Valera  I attend the meetings. \n An Leas-Cheann Comhairle  Let us hear the reply without interruption. \n Éamon Ó Cuív  Deputy de Valera and I asked a straight question — is it intended to give the House or a committee of the Oireachtas an opportunity to debate all the information in relation to SACs, including the compensation package, before they are implemented and to be part of the consultation process? \n Mr. M. Higgins  There will be opportunities to discuss this in general.  We discussed it recently  at a meeting of the Select Committee on Social Affairs, at which Deputy Quill was present. Unfortunately, the Deputies opposite could not be present on that day.  I am sure there will be other opportunities, both in committees and in general—— \n Miss de Valera  We do not have the necessary documentation. \n Mr. Molloy  We are discussing it in a vacuum. \n An Leas-Cheann Comhairle  Let us hear the reply to the question which was put. \n Mr. M. Higgins  In relation to the other matter, there are ongoing discussions with the farming organisations on the construction of the compensation package.  The regulations will be made under the legislation governing Ireland's accession to the European Union. \n Mr. Molloy  Sheer incompetence. \n Mr. M. Higgins  Rather than discussing the precise detail before it is finished, I will examine the best and most appropriate way of having a discussion on this matter in the House. \n Éamon Ó Cuív  Is it correct that the Minister cannot give us an undertaking to have the matter debated by the Oireachtas after the final proposals are made, but before they are implemented? \n Mr. M. Higgins  It would be reckless to give such an undertaking this afternoon. \n Miss de Valera  Another case of retrospective consultation. \n Mr. Molloy  Will the Minister accept that nothing I have heard from him today is likely to ease the fears of individual farmers who have a cloud hanging over them due to this pending legislation because they have not been fully informed of the effect it will have on them?  We have already had an indication from Deputy Nealon that, as a Government backbencher, he does not understand the proposals and has asked the Minister for information on them.  I was in Sligo last Sunday to select a candidate for the Progressive Democrats; perhaps when the new Deputy comes to the House we will have more information to convey to the people of Sligo.  I was met there by a delegation from the Sligo IFA which expressed serious anger and concern at the introduction of this legislation without information. \n An Leas-Cheann Comhairle  We must proceed by way of question. \n Mr. Molloy  I have asked the Minister on three or four occasions to agree, at the request of Deputies, to postpone the introduction of this  legislation after 1 February, until all these matters are fully out in the open so that people can see how the appeal mechanism, restrictions and compensation will work. \n An Leas-Cheann Comhairle  Thank you, Deputy; that should be adequate. \n Mr. Molloy  I have asked that question three times already but it has not been answered yet. \n An Leas-Cheann Comhairle  We will get the answer now.  I want to move on to other business after this. \n Mr. M. Higgins  It would be highly irresponsible to say one could postpone the implementation of something when the European Commission has expressed an opinion on our delay in implementing it.  These matters now fall to me to be implemented. \n Éamon Ó Cuív  What about our national democracy? \n Miss de Valera  What about the national interest? \n Mr. M. Higgins  The national interest is very important but it would be irresponsible to suggest one could have an open ended deferral.  I have already said my reason for postponing the decision until February was to give an opportunity for the very good consultation process, which has already started, to be spread and widened to answer all the questions.  I will review the situation in January but I am quite confident all the information to which the Deputy reasonably referred can be provided before 1 February. \n An Leas-Cheann Comhairle  I will call Deputy de Valera after Deputy Quill for a concluding question; we really should move on after that. \n Miss Quill  Will the Minister accept it is more important to enlist the goodwill, trust, support and co-operation of farmers on this issue than it is to meet an official deadline set on the European stage?  Will he further accept that much of what we quite rightly seek to preserve and protect has been endangered by farming habits over generations and grazing practices?  Will he further accept that if this process is to be successful, he must enter into ongoing dialogue with the farmers because they are the custodians of our environment who are in situ day after day?  The success of this legislation will rest on them at the end of the day. \n Mr. M. Higgins  I decided to postpone it until 1 February in response to a request at a meeting I had with farming organisations.  I have already stated what the Deputy suggested.  We do not have to make a choice between farming as a practice and responsible ecological management.  We  owe a great deal to the achievement of those closest to the land.  The dialogue has already commenced and will continue.  I intend to use the period after Christmas and during January to answer all the questions which are reasonably posed. \n Miss de Valera  Does the Minister intend to give all the available information to Members? He said he is prepared to review the situation over Christmas and into the new year.  He is aware there are no plenary sessions of this House during that time.  Will he be prepared to give all the available information in early January to Members and other interested groups before a decision is taken? \n Mr. M. Higgins  A booklet called \"Farming in Nature\", or \"An Feirmeoireacht agus an Nádúr\" in Irish, which explains the procedures which have been the substance of these parliamentary questions will be distributed to every Deputy and Senator.  I hope it will be of some assistance. \n Miss de Valera  When will a committee have an opportunity to discuss it? \n Mr. M. Higgins  I will be delighted to come into this House on any occassion to discuss any of these matters. \n Miss de Valera  That will be on 22 January at the earliest; that will be too late if the decision has to be taken by 1 February. \n Mr. M. Higgins  If the Deputy is suggesting we recall the Dáil on Christmas Day or St. Stephen's Day—— \n Miss de Valera  I suggest we have a committee meeting to deal with the issue; I am disappointed by the Minister's failure to agree to that. \n Mr. Gallagher  (Donegal South-West): I wish to express the concern of the people I represent in Donegal and in Connacht-Ulster. \n Mr. Carey  A question. \n Mr. Gallagher  (Donegal South-West): When the House decides that the Minister of State should be the Ceann Comhairle, I will abide by that; but as long as you, a Leas-Cheann Comhairle, are in the Chair I will take my directions from you. \n An Leas-Cheann Comhairle  Thank you. \n Mr. Gallagher  (Donegal South-West): There is grave concern throughout the country in regard to Directive 92/43/EEC.  I know the Minister is also concerned about it but he—— \n An Leas-Cheann Comhairle  Let us proceed by way of question. \n Mr. Gallagher  (Donegal South-West): Will the Minister put the national interest before any EU directive?  He will have the full support of this House and every Irish MEP if he so does.  This legislation should not be expedited.  Will the Minister confirm his earlier indication that he will review the situation in January and provide an extension if one is required? \n Mr. M. Higgins  I assure Deputy Gallagher that my decision to defer signature until February was not taken lightly, given that an opinion had been expressed in Europe at what is perceived as being the delay in Ireland in implementing these directives. I am trying to achieve a balanced approach towards it.  I appreciate Opposition Deputies' right to express concerns.  Such meetings as are appropriate will take place.  In reply to Deputy de Valera, I would have no hesitation in going to a committee at any time to answer questions. \n Mr. Molloy  I would suggest to the Minister that we are the most compliant member state in the European Union and need have no fear that we are not living up to our responsibilities.  The Commission would surely accept that there is grave concern among the farming community in Ireland about what is being proposed.  I would ask it to reconsider postponing the implementation date and give further opportunity for longer discussions. \n An Leas-Cheann Comhairle  We are having repetition. \n Mr. Molloy  Would the Minister agree that the valuable natural habitat, that is now considered by Commission and by everybody to be worth preserving and which is the subject of these directives, is there because of the traditional farming practices of generations of Irish farmers?  It was not the European Commission that put it there.  It was the farming community through the centuries and they have a much greater vested interest in preserving it than those who want to impose restrictions upon them. \n Mr. M. Higgins  What will be achieved will involve farmers.  One does not have to choose between ecological responsibility and farming.  As to Deputy Molloy's point, nobody is imposing and nobody is impounding. \n Mr. Molloy  The word \"impounding\" came from the Connemara IFA. \n Mr. M. Higgins  Where there is activity that is not consistent with sustainability within a special area of conservation, that has to be resolved by methods that would include using a compensation mechanism.  This has to be discussed.  Already there has been a considerable attempt to facilitate all the different people involved by setting up an appeals mechanism and independent arbitration on any appeal.  We will continue in that spirit, in partnership with the farming community. "

        "questionType": "oral",
        "answerText": " Mr. Taylor  A number of pre-budget submissions were received in the Department of Finance from interested parties who, it is understood, did not make their submissions directly to the Select Committee on Finance and General Affairs and further submissions continue to be received from various persons or representative groups who choose to write to the Minister.  The Deputy will be aware that the committee's orders of reference as amended by the Dáil on 4 July inserted a proviso that nothing in the orders of reference should prejudice the right of individuals to meet with the Minister for Finance with a view to making pre-budget submissions directly to him in accordance with long-standing practice. \n Mr. M. McDowell  I presume the Minister did not want to answer Question No. 4 in conjunction with this question.  Therefore I will not trespass on it until he has a chance to deal with this question.  Is it satisfactory that Deputy McCreevy, Deputy O'Hanlon and I should sit in a committee room listening to people who have moving and compelling cases to make for tax expenditure when at the same time a process is going on behind our backs, about which we have no knowledge whatsoever?  A disadvantaged group can come in seeking relief worth £0.5 million and the committee can spend half a day on it and at the end of the day can be told to be fiscally responsible.  Meanwhile in Merrion Street somebody is looking for relief of £20 million and none of us knows of it.  Surely it is a most unsatisfactory state of affairs that we get only a  self-selecting group of people coming to us whereas the real business is being carried out behind closed doors. \n Mr. Taylor  I do not want to comment on whether it is satisfactory beyond saying that is the order of reference of the Dáil.  It was the Dáil which left open the option of the Minister for Finance to receive submissions directly, in accordance with long-standing practice.  That is the rule of the Dáil and perhaps it should be changed and, if so, it would be a matter for you, a Cheann Comhairle, on the Committee on Procedure and Privileges.  I understand the committee advertises for submissions and it is open to any group to respond and make their submission to the committee if that is what they want to do. \n Mr. M. McDowell  The committee advertises for submissions because it was given this job and asked to do various things by the Minister.  Are we the patsys who provide the front of house service for those for whom it would be too embarrassing to be seen on the steps of Government Buildings while at the same time the heavy players settle down to obtaining major concessions behind our backs?  What is the point in having politicians dealing with the high profile public issues which could have small implications for the Exchequer while the bureaucrats and the Minister are privately engaged in a different process which could have far more radical consequences for next year's budget?  Why should one aspect of this process be in public and the other in private? \n Mr. Taylor  The responsibility here rests with the Minister for Finance.  The procedure set up for the committee is relatively new and the parameters were set down by the Dáil.  In the context of the 1997 budget, the Minister for Finance has not as yet held any pre-budget meetings although meetings have been arranged with a number of the social partners.  From the point of view of any person or group who wish to make a submission, it is open to them to respond to the advertisement and come into the committee.  One cannot stop any person or group seeking to make representations to the Minister for Finance and he or his officials may respond in any particular way and may decline it.  The long established procedure until relatively recently was that representations were made to the Minister for Finance alone.  It is a new procedure which no doubt will be reviewed from time to time by the House as the necessity arises. \n Mr. M. McDowell  I suggest the Minister remember the context in which this change occurred.  Heretofore, private representations were made to the Minister but there was also the alternative route of going to Jury's Hotel and paying £100 for a pre-budget lunch with the  Minister of State, Deputy Eithne Fitzgerald.  We were told we would tidy up the whole arrangement and everything would be above board, that all the hard cases would be examined by a committee with the aid of experts to tell us the implications of what was going on.  We now find there is a parallel track where the real business is done and that, in large measure, we were going through a PR stunt to keep the heat off the Minister. \n An Ceann Comhairle  The Deputy seems to be imparting information rather than seeking it. \n Mr. Taylor  It seems Deputy McDowell is getting carried away in respect of this matter.  To date the Minister has not had pre-budget meetings.  Meetings have been arranged but only with the social partners.  It will be accepted by any reasonable Deputy that that is entirely proper and appropriate. "

        "questionType": "oral",
        "answerText": " Mr. Taylor  I propose to take Questions Nos. 4, 6, 10 and 33 together.  In relation to the representations made on behalf of the persons mentioned in the Deputies' questions, my colleague the Minister for Finance, Deputy Quinn, has already supplied details of these on 10 December, in reply to a parliamentary question from Deputy Bertie Ahern.  On that occasion, the Minister stated that representations were received by his Department in February last from the persons mentioned by the Deputies for changes in the taxation legislation dealing with discretionary trusts.  Two changes were proposed in the representations.  One change proposed was the extension of the capital gains tax retirement relief to cover specified categories of disposals of business assets by trustees to specified categories of relatives of the person who set up the trust. The second change proposed was the crediting of discretionary trust tax paid against any capital acquisitions tax liability arising for the recipients of assets distributed from discretionary trusts. Discussions subsequently took place between officials and representatives of the persons concerned in regard to the proposals in view of their complex nature and the issues involved.  It was made clear by officials that they had no mandate for negotiation and what they were doing was exploring the matter.  In the event the proposals put forward by the representatives were not acceptable and this was made clear to the representatives in October.  The Minister for Finance sees no conflict with this case and the initiative agreed with the Select Committee on Finance and General Affairs to invite pre-budget submissions for 1997.  The approaches were made last February and the issues involved were complex and required examination by officials.  The committee's terms of reference as agreed by Order of the Dáil on 4 July 1996 provide that:  nothing contained herein shall prejudice the right of individuals to meet with the Minister for Finance with a view to making pre-budget submissions directly to him in accordance with longstanding practice.  As was said earlier, representations from the persons mentioned by the Deputies were made last February in the context of the 1996 Finance Bill.  The advertisements by the Select Committee on Finance and General Affairs seeking submissions in writing to be sent to them were placed in the newspapers on 28 June with a deadline for receipt of 2 August 1996.  As mentioned in the reply to a priority question earlier today, the Minister has received, and continues to receive, submissions from persons who chose to write to him directly in relation to pre-budget matters.  All these submissions are, of course, considered in the run up to the budget. \n Mr. M. McDowell  Will the Minister agree that if the proposed changes had a gross fiscal value of about £80 million they would radically affect  the budget arithmetic for 1997?  If that was the subject matter of negotiations between departmental officials and interested parties, the beneficiaries of the trust and their legal and accountancy representatives, the least the Select Committee on Finance and General Affairs was entitled to was a hint that while it was grubbing around with £500,000 here and there and considering relief in certain areas, other people were in negotiation for something that would sweep away the basis for making any tax concessions that committee contemplated recommending to the Minister. \n Mr. Taylor  The Deputy is right in that any variation of £80 million would affect the budgetary arithmetic for 1997.  That is obvious and undeniable.  There were no negotiations in the meeting with officials of the Department of Finance.  They explored the proposals put to them but nothing was done in that regard.  As regards the committee looking at the relevant dates, the events took place in February 1996 whereas the advertisements and arrangements in connection with the committee were not made until June — the events took place before the committee was up and running.  If any proposal had been contemplated when the committee was in operation, the Minister for Finance would have considered whether it was appropriate to refer it to the committee.  Such circumstances could arise, but in so far as this person is concerned, that was not an issue at the time. \n Mr. M. McDowell  The Minister stated that contact was made in February last, but the decision was not made clear until October of this year.  Is it not reasonable to conclude, therefore, that the matter was under examination and no clear decision was made until the autumn of this year?  Does it not follow that this was a live issue in the Department of Finance at a time when the committee advertised for submissions from the public and conducted inquiries into other budget submissions? \n Mr. Taylor  I cannot outline the exact progression of dates as between February and October.  In October it was conveyed to the representatives of the people who made the submission that nothing would be done about it and their proposal was not acceptable.  I cannot say when precisely that decision was reached or whether the matter was seriously contemplated. The representation was a non-event.  It was not the Minister for Finance who met the people involved but Department officials, who simply listened to them.  Nothing was done about the matter.  The relevant activity took place before the committee procedure was in operation. \n Mr. McCreevy  Were the initial representations made to the Minister for Finance or the Department of Finance? \n Mr. Taylor  Representations were made on behalf of the persons mentioned to my colleague, the Minister for Finance. \n Mr. McCreevy  Were they written or oral representations, or both? \n Mr. Taylor  I do not have that information, but I imagine on a matter as complex as this, a written submission would have been made in the first instance and, at the meetings with officials following that, it would have been backed up with oral representations along the same lines. \n Mr. McCreevy  I would like the Minister to clarify the matter because my experience is that it is difficult to meet officials in the Department of Finance to propose tax changes.  Changes usually result from representations made directly to the Minister and sometimes the secretary but more often than not representations are initially made to the Revenue Commissioners who, in briefing the Minister for Finance, advise him that in the context of the budget he should consider representations made by a certain person or body.  There is nothing wrong with people making representations to the Revenue Commissioners, the Minister for Finance or the Select Committee on Finance and General Affairs on tax changes. That is the essence of the democratic process.  I would like clarification on how the representations were made in this case. \n Mr. Taylor  Does the Deputy want to know to whom the written representations were addressed? \n Mr. McCreevy  It would not be the first time representations were made to the Minister for Finance or the Revenue Commissioners on changes in tax law which would affect a particular group of people.  I can think of some areas where Ministers for Finance have changed legislation down the years.  Eight times out of ten the initial representation is made by the Revenue Commissioners who would be aware of the matter in the first instance.  In this case, because of its high profile and media coverage of the event, I would like to know how the representations were made and what was the chain of events. \n Mr. Taylor  Does the Deputy wish to know whether the representations were addressed in the first instance to the Minister or the Revenue Commissioners and whether the initial approach was made in writing or verbally? \n Mr. McCreevy  Yes.  There is nothing sinister in my querying the matter, but it is important that it is clarified as soon as possible. \n Mr. M. McDowell  Were the views of the Revenue Commissioners sought on these proposals?  Although the initial contact was made in February 1996, may I take it that nothing  happened between March and September, or was there ongoing contact on and exploration of the issue?  Will the Minister also indicate in relation to these matters whether the magnitude of the tax changes sought would have required a separate Government decision?  Will he indicate also whether, up to the month of October 1996, any indication was given to the people seeking these tax changes that their proposal was unlikely to be accepted? \n Mr. Taylor  I have no information in the brief as to what exactly was said at any particular meeting.  There meetings were held to explore the proposals, two of which took place in July with the final meeting being held in October, which presumably was when they were told nothing would be done about it.  It seems from reading the brief that the representations never got off the ground. \n Mr. M. McDowell  Does it follow then that all the meeting took place after the Select Committee on Finance and General Affairs had advertised for public representations?  Is it fair to draw an inference from the Minister's reply that the approach was made in February and that officials agreed in July to meet the proponents of this change on two occasions to explore the financial implications of what they were proposing?  What happened between those two meetings in October when a negative decision was imparted to these people? \n Mr. Taylor  I can only assume that the proposals made, their detail having been explored at the meetings in July, were considered in the Department of Finance to determine whether they warranted advancing or further consideration in any way.  It seems that by October they came to the conclusion they were not.  They were, accordingly, told that and nothing was done about them. \n Mr. McCreevy  In case the Minister may inadvertently mislead the House, I doubt that a decision of that magnitude would be made by officials down the line in the Department of Finance.  That is not my experience of the matter, and I realise the Minister is not the Minister concerned.  I imagine decisions such as that would have to be made at a higher level.  I suggest they would at least have to be put to the Secretary of the Department or the Minister who has ultimate responsibility for these matters.  Perhaps in a subsequent Question Time the Minister might inform us further on the matter. \n Mr. Taylor  It is safe to say that the Minister for Finance has responsibility for decisions of this nature that are made in his Department.  There is no question about that. \n Mr. M. McDowell  I asked earlier whether the gross value of the changes being sought was of the order of £80 million. \n Mr. Taylor  Deputy McDowell will appreciate that the Minister for Finance is not at liberty to disclose tax details which relate to particular taxpayers since these matters are confidential.

        "answerText": " Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Spring)  I propose to take Questions Nos. 16 and 18 together.  Progress in the multi-party talks, particularly  since their resumption in September, has been frustratingly slow.  It has not yet been possible to reach agreement on the handling of decommissioning and thereby to complete the opening plenary session and move into substantive three-stranded negotiations.  The two Governments are united in their commitment to the implementation of all aspects of the report of the international body as the best possible basis for progress in decommissioning.  We continue to hope that all other participants will agree to work with us on that basis and discussions on this matter are continuing in Belfast.  No dates have as yet been agreed either for a Christmas break in the talks or for their resumption in the New Year.  Despite the disappointing pace of developments in the talks, it is important to emphasise that if operated with goodwill and commitment they still offer the potential for progress towards the achievement of a lasting and comprehensive negotiated settlement.  The ground rules and rules of procedure, guarantee the right of all participants to advance their views on all issues of concern, and create a negotiating structure in which all of the key relationships can be considered in parallel.  They also ensure that any agreement, even before it is put to the people for ratification, must be acceptable to the political representatives of both communities and to both Governments.  The existence of a potentially fully inclusive talks process, with prestigious international independent chairmanship, is a substantial asset and should be safeguarded, as far as possible, whatever the short-term difficulties.  The conditions for Sinn Féin's entry into the political talks currently under way in Belfast were carefully set out by both Governments in the communiqué of 28 February 1996 and in the ground rules and have been reiterated on many occasions, not least here in the past three quarters of an hour by the Taoiseach.  In our contacts with the British Government, most recently at Monday's Anglo-Irish summit, we have made it clear that we believe Sinn Féin should be included in the talks once those conditions have been met, and that we are anxious to see that objective achieved as soon as possible.  That is a strong argument for the earliest possible reinstatement of the IRA ceasefire which should never have been broken.  As the Taoiseach said on Monday, and has just repeated in the House, if the IRA clearly calls an unequivocal ceasefire in words that are believable, and provided there is nothing done that is inconsistent with this ceasefire or with the Mitchell principles, then Sinn Féin should be admitted to participation in the talks in accordance with the ground rules we have agreed. In practical terms, we hope this will be possible early in the New Year.  The Prime Minister, Mr. Major, has made it clear that he is unwilling to commit his Government to a specific timetable, which would have been our preferred approach.  However, he has also made it clear that he does not intend any undue delay.  Obviously, the sooner a ceasefire is called, the faster the goal of Sinn Féin's entry to the talks can be achieved. \n Mr. R. Burke  As this issue has been debated at length between the leader of my party and the Taoiseach, I will merely ask a few supplementaries.  It is an understatement to say the talks process has been frustratingly slow.  Is there a realistic hope that, with the good office of George Mitchell, the decommissioning issue might be resolved before the talks break for Christmas?  A date has not been fixed for their resumption. \n Mr. Spring  The talks process is frustratingly slow.  It is difficult and painstaking, but as we are making progress people want to stick with the process.  The only way to resolve these issues is through negotiation and discussion.  Our position on decommissioning continues to be based firmly on the implementation of all aspects of the Mitchell Report.  That report commands widespread support across a range of parties and is probably the only achievable way forward.  With the assistance of the chairman, Senator Mitchell, and his colleagues, we are engaged in detailed discussions with the other participants in the talks and while I cannot predict if there will be a breakthrough before Christmas, that remains our priority. \n Mr. M. McDowell  Does the Tánaiste agree that, apart from the question of decommissioning, confidence building measures are important at this stage?  Does he also agree that in addition to the potential for confidence building measures to accompany a ceasefire on the British side, in terms of security and release of prisoners, there is also great potential for the Republican movement to build confidence by indicating that punishment beatings have stopped, that those who have been banished from Northern Ireland under pain of punishment or killing are free to return and that all forms of paramilitary preparatory activity, such as targeting, intelligence gathering and so on, will cease?  Does he agree those achievements would be much more convincing than particular formulations of the decommissioning process in creating an atmosphere of trust that the violence is over for good. \n Mr. Spring  I am sure the Deputy will accept that decommissioning is the key to making progress in the talks and in terms of building confidence.  If we could get agreement in the talks process on how to deal with the decommissioning issue in a satisfactory manner, we could move with confidence to discuss other issues.  The question of confidence building is part and parcel of the Anglo-Irish Intergovernmental Conference where we discuss a range of issues, including  punishment beatings, on a regular basis.  All and sundry abhor punishment beatings.  Matters such as surveillance, tracking preparation for a return to conflict, deployment of security forces, policing, parades, emergency legislation, the position of prisoners and other social and economic issues were discussed at the last meeting of the Intergovernmental Conference on 20 November.  There is a glaring lack of confidence between the communities in Northern Ireland borne out of history, distrust and sectarianism, which manifested itself recently in a nasty form in Ballymena.  With the British Government, we work on a daily basis to stimulate the communities on both sides to take the necessary steps to build confidence.  An important aspect of the cessation of violence, or the threat of violence, which we are seeking would be a clear indication that the phenomena mentioned by the Deputy are irrefutably forsaken.  Confidence in a ceasefire would be quickly undermined if the activities we tend to associate with paramilitaries continue. \n Mr. R. Burke  All Members want the ceasefire restored, it should never have broken down.  We also wanted talks to take place during the 17 months of the ceasefire, but that did not happen. There has been a breakdown of confidence.  The Government made it clear today, through the Taoiseach and the Tánaiste that there should be a definite date for the commencement of talks, with participation of Sinn Féin in the event of an unequivocal declaration of a ceasefire, including an end to punishment beatings, targeting and so on.  How can the Tánaiste realistically talk of confidence building measures when, in publishing the Estimates for Northern Ireland yesterday, Sir. Patrick Mayhew talked in a cynical way about an end to the peace dividend and major cutbacks in areas that would help to build confidence between the communities in Northern Ireland. This is sending out all the wrong signals.  The Tánaiste, the Taoiseach and John Hume, a major player in this process, have argued for a definite date for inclusive talks.  Members of the House also want a definite date for such talks. John Hume believes Monday's meeting generated nothing.  Why is the Government failing to get across to the British Government the need for a definite date for inclusive talks? What is wrong that this point cannot be got across? \n Mr. Spring  It is a matter of regret that we are unable to reach a shares position on this matter. As stated on numerous occasions, the primary onus rests with the IRA to unequivocally restore its ceasefire, which should never have been broken.  We believe that if that happens under the stated terms, and the Mitchell principles are adhered to, within a short time Sinn Féin should be included in the talks.  The circumstances are right now for the IRA to make that move and it should be done as quickly as possible. \n Mr. M. McDowell  What is the Government's understanding of Senator George Mitchell's commitment to remain as chairman of the talks? \n Mr. Spring  There was much speculation about Senator Mitchell's possible preferment for a position in Washington.  That has not happened and he will continue to participate in the talks. We have no indications to the contrary. \n Mr. R. Burke  While we are sorry Senator Mitchell did not secure the preferment referred to by the Tánaiste, his loss is our gain.  We are grateful for his help.  In the context of American involvement in getting the IRA to see sense and announce a ceasefire, could it not put pressure on the British Government to see sense in regard to a definite date for participation by Sinn Féin in all party talks?  Have the Americans been playing a role? How successful has it been?  I know we will be discussing this later under the question on Vice-President Gore. \n Mr. Spring  We will reach Question No. 21, which deals with the American situation, but I will comment on what Deputy Burke said.  We are very fortunate to have men of the calibre of former Senator George Mitchell, former Prime Minister Holkeri and General de Chastelain available to us.  They continue to be available to us and we look forward to working with them in future.  I will be quite happy to deal with all the aspects of American involvement under Question No. 21. "

        "answerText": " The Taoiseach  I propose to take Questions Nos. 7 to 11, inclusive, together.  As I informed the House on 13 November 1996, in reply to supplementary questions to Question No. 1, I understand that the office of the Director of Public Prosecutions first became aware of the problem relating to the composition of the Special Criminal Court at approximately 4.30 p.m. on Wednesday, 6 November 1996.  This occurred when a phone call was received by that office from the office of the Chief State Solicitor. I understand that the office of the Chief State Solicitor became aware that there was definitely a problem on the afternoon of 6 November 1996. This occurred on foot of an inquiry from the office of the Chief State Solicitor on the previous day to the Registrar of the court who in turn raised the matter with the Department of Justice. Contrary to suggestions made, there was no contact on the matter between the Chief State Solicitor's office and the Attorney General's office or the Department of Justice prior to 6 November.  The solicitor in the Chief State Solicitor's office who contacted the Registrar of the Special Criminal Court on 5 November is engaged exclusively on work for the Director of Public Prosecutions, who is independent in law in the discharge of his functions.  The solicitor's involvement in relation to the question of Judge Lynch's position arose in connection with his work for the DPP and is privileged as between the solicitor and his client.  For these reasons, I am unable, as Deputies will understand, to comment on the context in which the solicitor's conversation with the office of the Director of Public Prosecutions took place, beyond indicating as I have done the date and fact of the conversation.  As the Minister of State at my Department, Deputy Carey, informed the House in reply to Question No. 1 from Deputy Michael McDowell on 27 November 1996, the Attorney General read a newspaper reference to Judge Lynch sitting on the Special Criminal Court at the end of October 1996.  No one brought the matter to the Attorney's attention.  On 29 October 1996, there was a court report in The Irish Times of proceedings in the Special Criminal Court on 28 October in which Judge Lynch's name was mentioned.  To the best of his recollection, the Attorney General thinks it is likely that this is the newspaper report in which he saw the reference to Judge Lynch.  The Attorney cannot give the precise time or date on which he read this report which, as I have said, appeared in The Irish Times on 29 October. \n Miss Harney  Once again we are not being given information, and this time because of privilege.  Will the Taoiseach agree that the Director of Public Prosecutions can waive this privilege and has he asked him to do so? \n The Taoiseach  It is not feasible or desirable to waive privilege in regard to a current court case in a matter of this nature. \n Miss Harney  Will the Taoiseach agree it is important that we know the full facts in this matter, which is very unsatisfactory?  If for no other reason, the Director of Public Prosecutions should exercise his right, on the Taoiseach's request, to waive privilege so that we can get the information. \n The Taoiseach  It is important to know the facts but it is also important that there should not be any disclosure in respect of a matter which is the subject of court proceedings.  I do not propose to make any disclosure in the light of this. \n Mr. M. McDowell  Is the Taoiseach suggesting that to tell us the basis of the Chief State Solicitor's knowledge in this matter could prejudice the court proceedings?  Is he saying he cannot tell us some of the facts about the way in which State servants came to know about the problems in the Dominic Lynch case as it would endanger their defence of current proceedings in the High Court? \n The Taoiseach  The information the Deputy seeks relates to conversations between the Director of Public Prosecutions and the Chief State Solicitor's office in respect of a matter which is the subject of a court case.  Apart from giving the date and time of the conversation, which I have already done, it would not be appropriate to outline the content of the conversation which relates to matters currently before the courts.  The Deputy is familiar with the wisdom of not disclosing such information given that the matters in question are likely to be the subject of contest in court proceedings.  There is a well established practice that, for example, the consultations between a barrister and his client in any private or criminal case are not disclosed prior to hearing the case.  It is an important and well established principle of our legal system that the confidentiality between a client and the person acting on his behalf is maintained, particularly when the matter is the subject of court hearings. The suggestion that this should prudently be lifted in this case suggests that Deputy McDowell does not adequately appreciate the relevance of the general issue. \n Mr. M. McDowell  I understand the issues involved.  Why is it that when one asks the basis on which people in the State service came to the conclusion that Judge Dominic Lynch was functioning in the Special Criminal Court at a  time when he had been removed one is confronted with the answer that privilege is being claimed in respect of this matter?  Surely I am entitled to ask the Taoiseach the very simple question how State servants came to know Judge Dominic Lynch was serving in the Special Criminal Court at a time when he ought not to have done.  I do not see how the liberty of any citizen or a case before the courts can be adversely affected if the Taoiseach imparts that information to the House. \n The Taoiseach  The circumstances in which the relevant arm of the State which is responsible for the administration of the courts, the Department of Justice, came to be aware of this matter and acted upon it have already been the subject of extensive debate in the House.  What the Deputy is concerned about is an earlier conversation between two State servants which is covered by client confidentiality.  The State's knowledge of the matter took the form of knowledge obtained by, and immediately acted upon, the Minister for Justice in a manner which has already been the subject of extensive discussion in the House.  The Deputy knows the position. \n Mr. B. Ahern  Does the Taoiseach believe the Attorney General exercised his duties and responsibilities as guardian of the Constitution and protector of the public interest in the context of this affair?  When exactly did the Attorney General learn that Mr. Justice Lynch was still serving on the Special Criminal Court and when did he inform the Taoiseach?  If the Attorney General did not tell him until 12.45 a.m. on the day in question, did the Taoiseach not ask him why he had not informed him previously when it was obvious that he had known about the matter for several weeks? \n The Taoiseach  As the House is well aware, definitive knowledge on this matter did not become available to the Attorney General until the day in question.  I was informed about the matter at approximately 12.30 a.m. the following day.  It is well known that the Attorney General, who has no direct responsibility for the administration of the courts, raised two queries about this matter in a letter to the Department of Justice.  He had no definitive knowledge that the matter was as it subsequently transpired to be until a half an hour before I was informed.  The Attorney General acted in this matter, as in all other matters of which I am aware, with exemplary skill and dedication.  He is an outstanding public servant and he has carried out his job exceptionally well in this and every other matter, and the Deputies should accept that. \n Mr. O'Donoghue  Will the Taoiseach agree that privilege should be claimed sparingly in this House and only when it is absolutely necessary? Nobody can claim privilege in regard to a  conversation which took place between State officials on the improper composition of the Special Criminal Court given that everyone now knows the court was not properly constituted. Will the Taoiseach advise the House on whether the Director of Public Prosecutions or the solicitor concerned has claimed privilege and, if so, why? \n The Taoiseach  I do not agree with the Deputy's interpretation of the matter.  The general rule is that client confidentiality is claimed in all cases.  It is prudent that it should be claimed as it is extremely difficult to establish a basis for distinguishing cases where it ought or ought not to be claimed if one goes down the road of claiming it in only some cases.  The Deputy, who is familiar with the matter, will fully understand the reasons privilege is being claimed in this case.  Given the concerns previously expressed by him and others in the House about this matter and the pending court proceedings which are a matter of public record, it is disingenuous of the Deputy to seek a lifting of privilege in this case.  He is trying to some degree to have it both ways on this issue. \n Mr. D. Ahern  I think the Taoiseach said the Chief State Solicitor's office became definitively aware of the matter on 5 November.  This seems to suggest that it had some inkling of the matter before that date.  Will the Taoiseach give a fuller explanation of this point?  It appears the Attorney General read the newspaper report on 29 October.  Did he speak to anyone in his office about it?  He wrote to the Minister for Justice some days later — the letter was received on 5 November.  Does the Taoiseach accept that the Attorney General should have telephoned the office of the Minister for Justice, the Director of Public Prosecutions, the Chief State Solicitor's office or the Registrar of the Special Criminal Court on the day in question to find out if the report he had read in the newspaper was correct?  He had known from October there was a problem in the Special Criminal Court? \n The Taoiseach  I am sure the Deputy will acknowledge this matter has already been the subject of extensive debate.  When I referred to State authorities becoming definitively aware, I was referring to the Minister for Justice becoming aware of the matter. \n Mr. D. Ahern  That is not what I asked. \n The Taoiseach  I will start again.  The Department of Justice is responsible for the administration of the courts.  When the Minister for Justice became aware of the nature of the problem she acted immediately.  There has been an inquiry and an extensive debate—— \n Mr. D. Ahern  On a point of order, I did not ask that question.  I asked when the Chief State Solicitor's office became aware of the matter. \n The Taoiseach  Will the Deputy allow me to answer the question? \n An Ceann Comhairle  When questions are asked, the Taoiseach or the Minister concerned must be allowed to reply in their own fashion.  I shall allow further questions if there is time. \n Mr. D. Ahern  It is like extracting a tooth. \n The Taoiseach  Will the Deputy allow me to reply to his question properly?  He should not anticipate not getting an answer until I have completed my reply. \n Mr. B. Ahern  Christmas is three weeks away. \n The Taoiseach  The authorities in charge of the administration of the courts and ensuring they are properly constituted is the Department of Justice. When the Minister for Justice became definitively aware that there was a problem, she acted immediately.  As the House is aware, there was earlier correspondence from the Attorney General inquiring about the matter.  That correspondence was not dealt with in the way it should have been and that has been the subject of an inquiry.  It could be argued that if the correspondence had been dealt with properly, the relevant authority — the Department of Justice — would have become definitively aware of the problem much earlier.  Deputy Ahern asked me about the state of knowledge of the Director of Public Prosecutions office and the Chief State Solicitor's office.  Neither of those offices is the State authority responsible for the constitution and administration of the courts.  They are responsible for preparing cases for the courts or pleading before them—— \n Mr. D. Ahern  Do they not have an interest in the matter? \n The Taoiseach  Of course they have an interest in the matter, but statutory responsibility for ensuring everything is in order in the courts does not rest with either of those offices, it rests with the Department of Justice.  In regard to the non-discharge of responsibilities by the Department of Justice in this matter, extensive answers, on the basis of an independent inquiry, have been given to the House.  Deputy Ahern asked me for information about the discussions that took place between the Chief State Solicitor's office, the Director of Public Prosecutions and the Registrar of the courts in this matter.  I have given the date and time of the only such discussions that occurred.  There were no other discussions of that nature.  For the reasons I explained to Deputy McDowell, I am not in a position to give anything other than the time and date of the discussions.  The context and content of those conversations are covered by a legitimate and understandable plea of client confidentiality in respect of current important court cases.  That has been acknowledged by Members on all sides.  It would be prejudicial to the case that needs to be made if one side in those cases were obliged by me or anybody else to release information about internal communications between various people acting for the State in respect of those court cases if the other side was not obliged to make similar disclosures about discussions that may have taken place between client and legal adviser.  I am sure Members understand why that principle of client confidentiality is preserved. \n Mr. O'Donoghue  I am sure the Taoiseach will accept that the Chief State Solicitor or members of his office are not clients of the Director of Public Prosecutions and that the Director of Public Prosecutions is not the client of the Chief State Solicitor or members of his office.  Is the Taoiseach claiming privilege for the Director of Public Prosecutions and the solicitor in the Chief State Solicitor's office or are they claiming privilege through him?  Will he acknowledge that any communication between them in regard to the improper constitution of the Special Criminal Court could not affect the cases before the court? \n The Taoiseach  The Deputy is wrong in all his assumptions.  The Chief State Solicitor's office is acting in a client relationship with the Director of Public Prosecutions.  I am not claiming privilege, privilege exists as a general principle of law in respect of client communication with the respective legal adviser. \n Mr. M. McDowell  Somebody has to claim it. \n The Taoiseach  If a claim of privilege is to be made, it would be made in a court.  It would not be appropriate for me to claim such privilege or seek to set aside such a general principle of client confidentiality.  In view of the concern of Members about these matters and the issues involved in the court cases, I am sure they will understand why it is appropriate to have client confidentiality in respect of any matters material to pending hearings. \n Mr. O'Dea  The Taoiseach now appears to be justifying his refusal to give the information requested on the basis that privilege may be claimed in a subsequent court case. \n The Taoiseach  Privilege exists. \n Mr. O'Dea  The Taoiseach told the House repeatedly that the Attorney General did not have a role in this matter.  Does he accept that the Attorney General is independent in the exercise of his role as guardian of the public interest?  Does the Taoiseach accept that the Attorney General decides the ambit of that role and that he made this matter his business?  Otherwise, how could one explain him writing letters in an official capacity about the constitution of the Special Criminal Court?  Does the Taoiseach accept the Attorney General did the business badly on this occasion?  Does he consider it acceptable that the Attorney General should read a newspaper report on a Tuesday when the Special Criminal Court is sitting and write a laconic letter the following Friday?  Was the letter of 2 November from the Attorney General made available to the Cromien-Molloy Committee? \n The Taoiseach  The matter of the second letter from the Attorney General was discussed with the Cromien-Molloy committee.  They did not consider it necessary or relevant for them to see that letter.  I indicated that as far as the Attorney General was concerned there was no problem making it available to them if they had requested or required it, but they did not.  Regarding the role of the Attorney General as the protector of the Constitution, Deputy O'Dea is correct.  The Attorney General is absolutely independent in regard to the exercise of that function.  That means I am not accountable on his behalf to the House in regard to that aspect of his work.  I am accountable to it in regard to other aspects of his work and I am answering questions here in regard to this matter on the basis of the other general responsibility I have for the functioning of his office.  I explained to Deputy O'Dea and other Deputies that the Attorney General does not have responsibility for the administration of the courts.  That responsibility rests with the Department of Justice.  As Deputy O'Dea said, the Attorney General had a role in the matter and that was acknowledged from the outset. Were it not that the Attorney General alerted the Department of Justice to this matter in writing, we would probably have had a very different inquiry in regard to it.  That the Attorney General was industrious and alert enough—— \n Mr. O'Dea  Is that what the Taoiseach calls it? \n The Taoiseach  ——to make the relevant inquiries put the Department of Justice on notice of a problem on which, unfortunately, it did not act with sufficient speed.  It is a matter of public record that although the Attorney General did not and does not have responsibility for administration of the courts, he drew to the attention of the Department of Justice in writing — the most appropriate, recordable and definite form possible — the potential problem.  When the Attorney General became aware there was definitely a problem as distinct from an issue which seemed to be unexplained, he and the Minister for Justice acted with great speed on the matter. \n Mr. M. McDowell  The Taoiseach said definitive awareness did not arise until a certain point.  If people read something in a newspaper and it started the alarm bells ringing in their minds, presumably they would verify the matter before they would waste their time writing a letter.  Will the Taoiseach indicate if the Attorney General took any step to verify the newspaper report he read on Tuesday, 29 October last?  In view of widespread publicity given to new reforms in the Attorney General's office, is there a record of the date on which the letter dated Friday, 1 November 1996 left that office?  Did it go by post or was it delivered by hand?  Is there any record of how the letter was sent from that office to the office on Stephen's Green as there is no record of it being received in that office until five days later? \n The Taoiseach  The Attorney General took the appropriate step to verify the facts, which was to communicate in writing — the most reliable form possible — with the people responsible under law for the verification of the appropriateness of the arrangements in the courts, the Department of Justice.  When the Attorney General read the newspaper report he acted by dictating a letter to the Department of Justice.  He was not at that time in possession of the full facts.  He addressed his query to the people who were responsible for having the full facts, the Department of Justice. There were a number of possibilities at that time as to why Mr. Justice Lynch might have been sitting on that court.  One being that the date of retirement might have been fixed for a later date than the date of the meeting.  The Attorney General did not know at the time he dictated the letter—— \n Mr. M. McDowell  How was the letter sent? \n The Taoiseach  The Deputy might allow me to continue. \n Mr. E. O'Keeffe  A traceability system should be put in place. \n The Taoiseach  The Attorney General was aware the matter was potentially of some moment, therefore, he had directed a letter to the relevant Department, but there were other possibilities that might have existed which were in his mind.  The date of retirement might have been set for a later date than the date of the decision, the judge who was to replace Mr. Justice Lynch might not have taken up the office or might not have been able or willing to take up office in that court at that time or there might have been a subsequent Government decision on the matter at which Government meeting the Attorney General might not have been present.  It is important to make the point that the Attorney General acted with speed in writing—— \n Mr. M. McDowell  How was the letter sent? \n Mr. D. Ahern  With the speed of a tortoise. \n The Taoiseach  ——to the Department of Justice in regard to this matter.  It is important to make the point again that, unlike others who could have read Irish Oifigiúil or those who might have been aware of this, the Attorney General is one of the only people who put anything in writing in acting on the matter. \n Mr. D. Ahern  He is the only Attorney General we have. \n The Taoiseach  Others who had access to the relevant information through Iris Oifigiúil or through the newspapers did not take any appropriate step, but the Attorney General did. \n Mr. M. McDowell  Will the Taoiseach answer the question? \n The Taoiseach  The attempt by Deputy McDowell and others to introduce criticism of the Attorney General in this matter when he was the one person who took action on the matter is misplaced. \n Mr. M. McDowell  A Cheann Comhairle, I asked the Taoiseach if there was any record of the letter being sent in the first place. \n An Ceann Comhairle  The time for dealing with questions to the Taoiseach is now exhausted. \n The Taoiseach  I would like to answer that question in case any suggestion might be made that I am not willing to answer questions on this matter. \n An Ceann Comhairle  In accordance with the procedure the time has come to deal with priority questions. \n The Taoiseach  The answer to Deputy McDowell's question is that there is a recording system in regard to the typing of letters, but there is no recording system in regard to the date of the issuance of letters. \n Mr. M. McDowell  It could have gone out four days later. \n The Taoiseach  Letters are typed and recorded on computer as to their date of typing. Information is available as to the date of typing of the appropriate letter.  There ought to have been a record of the time of receipt of the letter in the Department of Justice where a date stamping arrangement normally operates.  The letter was sent by the State messenger service not by the postal service. \n Mr. S. Brennan  That was pre-Luas traffic. \n Mr. B. Ahern  I would like to ask many questions but time does not permit me to do so. Somebody must know how the letter was sent to the Department. \n The Taoiseach  I answered that. \n Mr. B. Ahern  Is the Taoiseach satisfied that the role of the staff in the Chief State Solicitor's office has not been adequately dealt with in the Cromien-Molloy report?  On 12 November the Taoiseach told the House he was happy that if all the questions on this matter were not answered during the various debates here — reams of questions have not been answered — he would move the matter to a select committee.  Having tried to get answers to our questions for the past four weeks, will the Taoiseach confirm that the matter will now be moved to a select committee? \n The Taoiseach  I did not say I would move the matter to a select committee.  The Deputy's recollection is faulty on that.  I said I would initiate inquiries in regard to any matter or any office not covered in the Cromien-Molloy report. I further said that, if they wished, it was open to Mr. Cromien and Dr. Molloy in preparing their report to inquire into the Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions.  They did not do so.  It was their decision and it was not as a result of any prompting.  As I explained to the House on four or five occasions communication in regard to the matter between the Chief State Solicitor's office and the Director of Public Prosecutions is privileged and covered by client confidentiality. It would not be appropriate for me to initiate any inquiry into that matter until any question of court proceedings arising from the nature and content of such a conversation has been removed by the completion of the relevant court cases. \n An Ceann Comhairle  Let us now proceed to priority questions to the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry, Question No. 15. \n Mr. Cowen  On a point of order—— \n An Ceann Comhairle  Order, allow the Chair to make his comment without interruption.  We now proceed to Question No. 15. "

        "questionType": "oral",
        "answerText": " The Taoiseach  I propose to take Questions Nos. 7 to 11, inclusive, together.  As I informed the House on 13 November 1996, in reply to supplementary questions to Question No. 1, I understand that the office of the Director of Public Prosecutions first became aware of the problem relating to the composition of the Special Criminal Court at approximately 4.30 p.m. on Wednesday, 6 November 1996.  This occurred when a phone call was received by that office from the office of the Chief State Solicitor. I understand that the office of the Chief State Solicitor became aware that there was definitely a problem on the afternoon of 6 November 1996. This occurred on foot of an inquiry from the office of the Chief State Solicitor on the previous day to the Registrar of the court who in turn raised the matter with the Department of Justice. Contrary to suggestions made, there was no contact on the matter between the Chief State Solicitor's office and the Attorney General's office or the Department of Justice prior to 6 November.  The solicitor in the Chief State Solicitor's office who contacted the Registrar of the Special Criminal Court on 5 November is engaged exclusively on work for the Director of Public Prosecutions, who is independent in law in the discharge of his functions.  The solicitor's involvement in relation to the question of Judge Lynch's position arose in connection with his work for the DPP and is privileged as between the solicitor and his client.  For these reasons, I am unable, as Deputies will understand, to comment on the context in which the solicitor's conversation with the office of the Director of Public Prosecutions took place, beyond indicating as I have done the date and fact of the conversation.  As the Minister of State at my Department, Deputy Carey, informed the House in reply to Question No. 1 from Deputy Michael McDowell on 27 November 1996, the Attorney General read a newspaper reference to Judge Lynch sitting on the Special Criminal Court at the end of October 1996.  No one brought the matter to the Attorney's attention.  On 29 October 1996, there was a court report in The Irish Times of proceedings in the Special Criminal Court on 28 October in which Judge Lynch's name was mentioned.  To the best of his recollection, the Attorney General thinks it is likely that this is the newspaper report in which he saw the reference to Judge Lynch.  The Attorney cannot give the precise time or date on which he read this report which, as I have said, appeared in The Irish Times on 29 October. \n Miss Harney  Once again we are not being given information, and this time because of privilege.  Will the Taoiseach agree that the Director of Public Prosecutions can waive this privilege and has he asked him to do so? \n The Taoiseach  It is not feasible or desirable to waive privilege in regard to a current court case in a matter of this nature. \n Miss Harney  Will the Taoiseach agree it is important that we know the full facts in this matter, which is very unsatisfactory?  If for no other reason, the Director of Public Prosecutions should exercise his right, on the Taoiseach's request, to waive privilege so that we can get the information. \n The Taoiseach  It is important to know the facts but it is also important that there should not be any disclosure in respect of a matter which is the subject of court proceedings.  I do not propose to make any disclosure in the light of this. \n Mr. M. McDowell  Is the Taoiseach suggesting that to tell us the basis of the Chief State Solicitor's knowledge in this matter could prejudice the court proceedings?  Is he saying he cannot tell us some of the facts about the way in which State servants came to know about the problems in the Dominic Lynch case as it would endanger their defence of current proceedings in the High Court? \n The Taoiseach  The information the Deputy seeks relates to conversations between the Director of Public Prosecutions and the Chief State Solicitor's office in respect of a matter which is the subject of a court case.  Apart from giving the date and time of the conversation, which I have already done, it would not be appropriate to outline the content of the conversation which relates to matters currently before the courts.  The Deputy is familiar with the wisdom of not disclosing such information given that the matters in question are likely to be the subject of contest in court proceedings.  There is a well established practice that, for example, the consultations between a barrister and his client in any private or criminal case are not disclosed prior to hearing the case.  It is an important and well established principle of our legal system that the confidentiality between a client and the person acting on his behalf is maintained, particularly when the matter is the subject of court hearings. The suggestion that this should prudently be lifted in this case suggests that Deputy McDowell does not adequately appreciate the relevance of the general issue. \n Mr. M. McDowell  I understand the issues involved.  Why is it that when one asks the basis on which people in the State service came to the conclusion that Judge Dominic Lynch was functioning in the Special Criminal Court at a  time when he had been removed one is confronted with the answer that privilege is being claimed in respect of this matter?  Surely I am entitled to ask the Taoiseach the very simple question how State servants came to know Judge Dominic Lynch was serving in the Special Criminal Court at a time when he ought not to have done.  I do not see how the liberty of any citizen or a case before the courts can be adversely affected if the Taoiseach imparts that information to the House. \n The Taoiseach  The circumstances in which the relevant arm of the State which is responsible for the administration of the courts, the Department of Justice, came to be aware of this matter and acted upon it have already been the subject of extensive debate in the House.  What the Deputy is concerned about is an earlier conversation between two State servants which is covered by client confidentiality.  The State's knowledge of the matter took the form of knowledge obtained by, and immediately acted upon, the Minister for Justice in a manner which has already been the subject of extensive discussion in the House.  The Deputy knows the position. \n Mr. B. Ahern  Does the Taoiseach believe the Attorney General exercised his duties and responsibilities as guardian of the Constitution and protector of the public interest in the context of this affair?  When exactly did the Attorney General learn that Mr. Justice Lynch was still serving on the Special Criminal Court and when did he inform the Taoiseach?  If the Attorney General did not tell him until 12.45 a.m. on the day in question, did the Taoiseach not ask him why he had not informed him previously when it was obvious that he had known about the matter for several weeks? \n The Taoiseach  As the House is well aware, definitive knowledge on this matter did not become available to the Attorney General until the day in question.  I was informed about the matter at approximately 12.30 a.m. the following day.  It is well known that the Attorney General, who has no direct responsibility for the administration of the courts, raised two queries about this matter in a letter to the Department of Justice.  He had no definitive knowledge that the matter was as it subsequently transpired to be until a half an hour before I was informed.  The Attorney General acted in this matter, as in all other matters of which I am aware, with exemplary skill and dedication.  He is an outstanding public servant and he has carried out his job exceptionally well in this and every other matter, and the Deputies should accept that. \n Mr. O'Donoghue  Will the Taoiseach agree that privilege should be claimed sparingly in this House and only when it is absolutely necessary? Nobody can claim privilege in regard to a  conversation which took place between State officials on the improper composition of the Special Criminal Court given that everyone now knows the court was not properly constituted. Will the Taoiseach advise the House on whether the Director of Public Prosecutions or the solicitor concerned has claimed privilege and, if so, why? \n The Taoiseach  I do not agree with the Deputy's interpretation of the matter.  The general rule is that client confidentiality is claimed in all cases.  It is prudent that it should be claimed as it is extremely difficult to establish a basis for distinguishing cases where it ought or ought not to be claimed if one goes down the road of claiming it in only some cases.  The Deputy, who is familiar with the matter, will fully understand the reasons privilege is being claimed in this case.  Given the concerns previously expressed by him and others in the House about this matter and the pending court proceedings which are a matter of public record, it is disingenuous of the Deputy to seek a lifting of privilege in this case.  He is trying to some degree to have it both ways on this issue. \n Mr. D. Ahern  I think the Taoiseach said the Chief State Solicitor's office became definitively aware of the matter on 5 November.  This seems to suggest that it had some inkling of the matter before that date.  Will the Taoiseach give a fuller explanation of this point?  It appears the Attorney General read the newspaper report on 29 October.  Did he speak to anyone in his office about it?  He wrote to the Minister for Justice some days later — the letter was received on 5 November.  Does the Taoiseach accept that the Attorney General should have telephoned the office of the Minister for Justice, the Director of Public Prosecutions, the Chief State Solicitor's office or the Registrar of the Special Criminal Court on the day in question to find out if the report he had read in the newspaper was correct?  He had known from October there was a problem in the Special Criminal Court? \n The Taoiseach  I am sure the Deputy will acknowledge this matter has already been the subject of extensive debate.  When I referred to State authorities becoming definitively aware, I was referring to the Minister for Justice becoming aware of the matter. \n Mr. D. Ahern  That is not what I asked. \n The Taoiseach  I will start again.  The Department of Justice is responsible for the administration of the courts.  When the Minister for Justice became aware of the nature of the problem she acted immediately.  There has been an inquiry and an extensive debate—— \n Mr. D. Ahern  On a point of order, I did not ask that question.  I asked when the Chief State Solicitor's office became aware of the matter. \n The Taoiseach  Will the Deputy allow me to answer the question? \n An Ceann Comhairle  When questions are asked, the Taoiseach or the Minister concerned must be allowed to reply in their own fashion.  I shall allow further questions if there is time. \n Mr. D. Ahern  It is like extracting a tooth. \n The Taoiseach  Will the Deputy allow me to reply to his question properly?  He should not anticipate not getting an answer until I have completed my reply. \n Mr. B. Ahern  Christmas is three weeks away. \n The Taoiseach  The authorities in charge of the administration of the courts and ensuring they are properly constituted is the Department of Justice. When the Minister for Justice became definitively aware that there was a problem, she acted immediately.  As the House is aware, there was earlier correspondence from the Attorney General inquiring about the matter.  That correspondence was not dealt with in the way it should have been and that has been the subject of an inquiry.  It could be argued that if the correspondence had been dealt with properly, the relevant authority — the Department of Justice — would have become definitively aware of the problem much earlier.  Deputy Ahern asked me about the state of knowledge of the Director of Public Prosecutions office and the Chief State Solicitor's office.  Neither of those offices is the State authority responsible for the constitution and administration of the courts.  They are responsible for preparing cases for the courts or pleading before them—— \n Mr. D. Ahern  Do they not have an interest in the matter? \n The Taoiseach  Of course they have an interest in the matter, but statutory responsibility for ensuring everything is in order in the courts does not rest with either of those offices, it rests with the Department of Justice.  In regard to the non-discharge of responsibilities by the Department of Justice in this matter, extensive answers, on the basis of an independent inquiry, have been given to the House.  Deputy Ahern asked me for information about the discussions that took place between the Chief State Solicitor's office, the Director of Public Prosecutions and the Registrar of the courts in this matter.  I have given the date and time of the only such discussions that occurred.  There were no other discussions of that nature.  For the reasons I explained to Deputy McDowell, I am not in a position to give anything other than the time and date of the discussions.  The context and content of those conversations are covered by a legitimate and understandable plea of client confidentiality in respect of current important court cases.  That has been acknowledged by Members on all sides.  It would be prejudicial to the case that needs to be made if one side in those cases were obliged by me or anybody else to release information about internal communications between various people acting for the State in respect of those court cases if the other side was not obliged to make similar disclosures about discussions that may have taken place between client and legal adviser.  I am sure Members understand why that principle of client confidentiality is preserved. \n Mr. O'Donoghue  I am sure the Taoiseach will accept that the Chief State Solicitor or members of his office are not clients of the Director of Public Prosecutions and that the Director of Public Prosecutions is not the client of the Chief State Solicitor or members of his office.  Is the Taoiseach claiming privilege for the Director of Public Prosecutions and the solicitor in the Chief State Solicitor's office or are they claiming privilege through him?  Will he acknowledge that any communication between them in regard to the improper constitution of the Special Criminal Court could not affect the cases before the court? \n The Taoiseach  The Deputy is wrong in all his assumptions.  The Chief State Solicitor's office is acting in a client relationship with the Director of Public Prosecutions.  I am not claiming privilege, privilege exists as a general principle of law in respect of client communication with the respective legal adviser. \n Mr. M. McDowell  Somebody has to claim it. \n The Taoiseach  If a claim of privilege is to be made, it would be made in a court.  It would not be appropriate for me to claim such privilege or seek to set aside such a general principle of client confidentiality.  In view of the concern of Members about these matters and the issues involved in the court cases, I am sure they will understand why it is appropriate to have client confidentiality in respect of any matters material to pending hearings. \n Mr. O'Dea  The Taoiseach now appears to be justifying his refusal to give the information requested on the basis that privilege may be claimed in a subsequent court case. \n The Taoiseach  Privilege exists. \n Mr. O'Dea  The Taoiseach told the House repeatedly that the Attorney General did not have a role in this matter.  Does he accept that the Attorney General is independent in the exercise of his role as guardian of the public interest?  Does the Taoiseach accept that the Attorney General decides the ambit of that role and that he made this matter his business?  Otherwise, how could one explain him writing letters in an official capacity about the constitution of the Special Criminal Court?  Does the Taoiseach accept the Attorney General did the business badly on this occasion?  Does he consider it acceptable that the Attorney General should read a newspaper report on a Tuesday when the Special Criminal Court is sitting and write a laconic letter the following Friday?  Was the letter of 2 November from the Attorney General made available to the Cromien-Molloy Committee? \n The Taoiseach  The matter of the second letter from the Attorney General was discussed with the Cromien-Molloy committee.  They did not consider it necessary or relevant for them to see that letter.  I indicated that as far as the Attorney General was concerned there was no problem making it available to them if they had requested or required it, but they did not.  Regarding the role of the Attorney General as the protector of the Constitution, Deputy O'Dea is correct.  The Attorney General is absolutely independent in regard to the exercise of that function.  That means I am not accountable on his behalf to the House in regard to that aspect of his work.  I am accountable to it in regard to other aspects of his work and I am answering questions here in regard to this matter on the basis of the other general responsibility I have for the functioning of his office.  I explained to Deputy O'Dea and other Deputies that the Attorney General does not have responsibility for the administration of the courts.  That responsibility rests with the Department of Justice.  As Deputy O'Dea said, the Attorney General had a role in the matter and that was acknowledged from the outset. Were it not that the Attorney General alerted the Department of Justice to this matter in writing, we would probably have had a very different inquiry in regard to it.  That the Attorney General was industrious and alert enough—— \n Mr. O'Dea  Is that what the Taoiseach calls it? \n The Taoiseach  ——to make the relevant inquiries put the Department of Justice on notice of a problem on which, unfortunately, it did not act with sufficient speed.  It is a matter of public record that although the Attorney General did not and does not have responsibility for administration of the courts, he drew to the attention of the Department of Justice in writing — the most appropriate, recordable and definite form possible — the potential problem.  When the Attorney General became aware there was definitely a problem as distinct from an issue which seemed to be unexplained, he and the Minister for Justice acted with great speed on the matter. \n Mr. M. McDowell  The Taoiseach said definitive awareness did not arise until a certain point.  If people read something in a newspaper and it started the alarm bells ringing in their minds, presumably they would verify the matter before they would waste their time writing a letter.  Will the Taoiseach indicate if the Attorney General took any step to verify the newspaper report he read on Tuesday, 29 October last?  In view of widespread publicity given to new reforms in the Attorney General's office, is there a record of the date on which the letter dated Friday, 1 November 1996 left that office?  Did it go by post or was it delivered by hand?  Is there any record of how the letter was sent from that office to the office on Stephen's Green as there is no record of it being received in that office until five days later? \n The Taoiseach  The Attorney General took the appropriate step to verify the facts, which was to communicate in writing — the most reliable form possible — with the people responsible under law for the verification of the appropriateness of the arrangements in the courts, the Department of Justice.  When the Attorney General read the newspaper report he acted by dictating a letter to the Department of Justice.  He was not at that time in possession of the full facts.  He addressed his query to the people who were responsible for having the full facts, the Department of Justice. There were a number of possibilities at that time as to why Mr. Justice Lynch might have been sitting on that court.  One being that the date of retirement might have been fixed for a later date than the date of the meeting.  The Attorney General did not know at the time he dictated the letter—— \n Mr. M. McDowell  How was the letter sent? \n The Taoiseach  The Deputy might allow me to continue. \n Mr. E. O'Keeffe  A traceability system should be put in place. \n The Taoiseach  The Attorney General was aware the matter was potentially of some moment, therefore, he had directed a letter to the relevant Department, but there were other possibilities that might have existed which were in his mind.  The date of retirement might have been set for a later date than the date of the decision, the judge who was to replace Mr. Justice Lynch might not have taken up the office or might not have been able or willing to take up office in that court at that time or there might have been a subsequent Government decision on the matter at which Government meeting the Attorney General might not have been present.  It is important to make the point that the Attorney General acted with speed in writing—— \n Mr. M. McDowell  How was the letter sent? \n Mr. D. Ahern  With the speed of a tortoise. \n The Taoiseach  ——to the Department of Justice in regard to this matter.  It is important to make the point again that, unlike others who could have read Irish Oifigiúil or those who might have been aware of this, the Attorney General is one of the only people who put anything in writing in acting on the matter. \n Mr. D. Ahern  He is the only Attorney General we have. \n The Taoiseach  Others who had access to the relevant information through Iris Oifigiúil or through the newspapers did not take any appropriate step, but the Attorney General did. \n Mr. M. McDowell  Will the Taoiseach answer the question? \n The Taoiseach  The attempt by Deputy McDowell and others to introduce criticism of the Attorney General in this matter when he was the one person who took action on the matter is misplaced. \n Mr. M. McDowell  A Cheann Comhairle, I asked the Taoiseach if there was any record of the letter being sent in the first place. \n An Ceann Comhairle  The time for dealing with questions to the Taoiseach is now exhausted. \n The Taoiseach  I would like to answer that question in case any suggestion might be made that I am not willing to answer questions on this matter. \n An Ceann Comhairle  In accordance with the procedure the time has come to deal with priority questions. \n The Taoiseach  The answer to Deputy McDowell's question is that there is a recording system in regard to the typing of letters, but there is no recording system in regard to the date of the issuance of letters. \n Mr. M. McDowell  It could have gone out four days later. \n The Taoiseach  Letters are typed and recorded on computer as to their date of typing. Information is available as to the date of typing of the appropriate letter.  There ought to have been a record of the time of receipt of the letter in the Department of Justice where a date stamping arrangement normally operates.  The letter was sent by the State messenger service not by the postal service. \n Mr. S. Brennan  That was pre-Luas traffic. \n Mr. B. Ahern  I would like to ask many questions but time does not permit me to do so. Somebody must know how the letter was sent to the Department. \n The Taoiseach  I answered that. \n Mr. B. Ahern  Is the Taoiseach satisfied that the role of the staff in the Chief State Solicitor's office has not been adequately dealt with in the Cromien-Molloy report?  On 12 November the Taoiseach told the House he was happy that if all the questions on this matter were not answered during the various debates here — reams of questions have not been answered — he would move the matter to a select committee.  Having tried to get answers to our questions for the past four weeks, will the Taoiseach confirm that the matter will now be moved to a select committee? \n The Taoiseach  I did not say I would move the matter to a select committee.  The Deputy's recollection is faulty on that.  I said I would initiate inquiries in regard to any matter or any office not covered in the Cromien-Molloy report. I further said that, if they wished, it was open to Mr. Cromien and Dr. Molloy in preparing their report to inquire into the Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions.  They did not do so.  It was their decision and it was not as a result of any prompting.  As I explained to the House on four or five occasions communication in regard to the matter between the Chief State Solicitor's office and the Director of Public Prosecutions is privileged and covered by client confidentiality. It would not be appropriate for me to initiate any inquiry into that matter until any question of court proceedings arising from the nature and content of such a conversation has been removed by the completion of the relevant court cases. \n An Ceann Comhairle  Let us now proceed to priority questions to the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry, Question No. 15. \n Mr. Cowen  On a point of order—— \n An Ceann Comhairle  Order, allow the Chair to make his comment without interruption.  We now proceed to Question No. 15. "

I recognise the importance of proper transparent and full disclosure by insurance companies and insurance intermediaries of all relevant information including all charges levied by investment product suppliers and intermediaries against clients' investments in their dealings with policyholders and prospective policyholders.  I am aware that market pressure and a greater level of awareness among consumers has contributed to a revision by some insurers of the way life insurance products are structured and sold so that persons taking out life assurance policies are clear as to the long-term nature of such policies and aware of the implications of their early encashment.  While I am hopeful that such market changes will permeate throughout the insurance industry, nevertheless the interests of consumers in this regard must be protected under Statute.  My Department has been engaged in extensive consultations with the insurance industry and other appropriate bodies in regard to drafting regulations to provide for effective disclosure of all relevant information in this regard, to enable the policyholder to make a fully informed decision when taking out an insurance policy.  The issues surrounding disclosure should not be solely manifested in commission levels.  Information in relation to early surrender or encashment values, illustration of benefits, nature and type of policy, premiums review, sales remuneration and status of the supplier of the product is equally important as is proper provision of all other relevant information prior to completion of the proposal form.  These general principles should also extend to non life insurance products.  It is also important that any new regime maintains in existence a strong, vibrant independent financial advisory sector. Independent financial advisers are a force for competition and a means of ensuring independence of advice.  They are a counter to dominance of financial services by big, powerful companies and can ensure a proper market in financial information.  The proposed transparency measures must be afforded the utmost consideration by all concerned as they will mark a fundamental change in the way insurance products are marketed and sold.  In this context discussions and negotiations with the insurance industry and consumer interests have been ongoing.  These deliberations, and other recent regrettable developments in the insurance market, have led to a re-evaluation of the thrust of the initial draft insurance regulations.  I am confident that this reappraisal  will be of long-term benefit to the insurance industry and consumers.  It is my intention to provide as much information as possible to the House in relation to the structural changes which will inevitably occur, both as a result of the evolutionary nature of insurance regulation and the way in which insurance products are marketed and sold. \n Kathleen Lynch  I agree the insurance industry has grown at a phenomenal rate in the past few years.  Prior to its recent expansion, people usually took out car and house insurance and insurance to cover their burial costs.  Nowadays people take out insurance to cover old age, ill health and so forth.  Will the Minister of State, in the course of his negotiations with the insurance industry, take into account the pyramid selling that is now part and parcel of the insurance industry?  Insurance is an extremely complex product and it will be expected to provide an income for the insured following an injury or other circumstance.  However, the introduction of pyramid selling in the industry means insurance is being sold by people who have little experience in that sector.  Will the Minister of State assure the House this matter will be included in his negotiations with the industry? \n Mr. Rabbitte  The Deputy is right to suggest the evolution of the industry is growing more complex.  The purpose of the ongoing discussions with the industry is to ensure a more intelligible and easily understood presentation of what is on offer to the prospective purchaser.  That includes information on early encashment or surrender values.  I have no doubt consumers will be able to shop around with more certainty and confidence that they understand what is on offer. "

McDowell asked the  asked the Taoiseach, in relation to a newspaper report (details supplied) referred to by him on 12 November 1996 in Dáil Éireann, the date on which the report was published; the newspaper in which it was published; the way in which it was drawn to the attention of the Attorney General or his office; when it was drawn to the attention of the Attorney General; the person by whom it was brought to his attention; and if he will make a statement on the matter. [22694/96] ",
        "answerText": " Minister of State at the Department of the Taoiseach (Mr. Carey)  The Attorney General read a newspaper reference to Judge Lynch sitting on the Special Criminal Court at the end of October 1996.  No one brought the matter to his attention.  On 29 October 1996 there was a court report in The Irish Times of proceedings in the Special Criminal Court on 28 October in which Judge Lynch was mentioned.  The Attorney General thinks it is likely that this was the newspaper report in which he saw the reference to Judge Lynch.  The Attorney General cannot say when he may have read the report. \n Mr. M. McDowell  Will the Minister of State agree that if the Attorney General read the report casually in the newspaper and it was not brought to his attention, then in all probability he read it the day the newspaper was published, 29 October?  Will he explain why three days elapsed before even a letter was apparently written, which took another four days to reach its destination? Will the Minister of State agree that if the Attorney General read the report on Tuesday, 29 October he would have been aware immediately of its significance as it told him that the worst calamity he had foreseen a month earlier had taken place? \n Mr. Carey  I outlined the Attorney General's position in my reply.  He read a newspaper reference to Judge Lynch sitting on the Special Criminal Court at the end of October 1996 and no one brought the matter to his attention.  I further stated that on 29 October there was a court report in The Irish Times of proceedings in the Special Criminal Court on 28 October in which Judge Lynch was mentioned.  The Attorney General thinks it is likely that this was the newspaper report in which he saw the reference to Judge Lynch.  He cannot say when he may have read the report. \n Mr. M. McDowell  With all due respect, the Minister of State has given an evasive reply.  If the Attorney General, who is an intelligent and bright man, read in the newspaper that Judge Lynch was presiding in the Special Criminal Court and knew two months previously that he had been removed as a judge of that court then it must immediately have impacted on him that a disaster was at hand and that his worst fears had come to pass.  It is not good enough for the Minister of State to say that the Attorney General does not know when he read the report. Surely it is engraved in his memory when the disaster became apparent to him.  Anyone in his position would have lifted the phone and asked if the newspaper report was true and attempted to establish the facts.  Will the Minister of State agree it is totally unacceptable for him to say that the Attorney General does not recollect when this first came to his attention, bearing in mind that if he read the report on the day it was published he allowed three days to elapse before he wrote a letter?  He did not send that letter by courier—— \n An Ceann Comhairle  The question is over long.  There is too much elaboration and repetition. \n Mr. M. McDowell  I am entitled to a fair answer to a fair question. \n An Ceann Comhairle  I have no control over such matters. \n Mr. M. McDowell  The Minister of State has offered no explanation as to why a week elapsed—— \n An Ceann Comhairle  This ought not to lead to argument.  Let us hear the Minister of State's reply. \n Mr. Carey  Deputies who tabled questions to the Taoiseach for answer this week were informed by his office that he would not be  available to answer them.  If Deputy McDowell wishes to resubmit his question to the Taoiseach he is entitled to do so. \n Mr. M. McDowell  I accept that offer. \n Mr. Carey  The Attorney General was not sure about the veracity of the newspaper report.  As the Taoiseach informed the Dáil on 12 November, the Attorney General wrote to the Minister for Justice on 1 November arising from the report.  The Attorney General is not attempting to slide out of anything; he has been upfront about the matter. \n Mr. D. Ahern  Did the Attorney General speak to anyone in his office immediately after he read the report?  Did he instruct anyone in his office to investigate the veracity of the report and to contact the Minister for Justice and the registrar of the Special Criminal Court to find out the position?  Is the Attorney General on the mailing list for Iris Oifigiúil ? \n An Ceann Comhairle  These matters are worthy of separate questions. \n Mr. Carey  While I have some knowledge of the matter and good briefing material, I cannot answer all the Deputy's questions.  The Attorney General was uncertain about the position after he read the newspaper report and he wrote to the Department of Justice on 1 November.  There is no great difficulty about the matter, which has been fully explained by the Taoiseach.  If Members wish to resubmit their questions to the Taoiseach then they are perfectly entitled to do so.  The matter has been debated ad nauseam and I do not see where this further debate is leading. \n Mr. D. Ahern  Given his admission that he cannot answer the questions put by Deputy McDowell and me, will the Minister of State accept that it would be preferable for us to put them directly to the Attorney General at a committee meeting so that we can find out what exactly what went on in his office? \n An Ceann Comhairle  We are having an extension of the subject matter by way of reference to committees. \n Mr. D. Ahern  I deserve an answer to my question. \n Mr. M. McDowell  The Minister of State said in reply to Deputy Ahern that the Attorney General did not know whether the report was true, he did nothing for a number of days, he did not ask anyone to investigate the report to see if it was true and he did not ask anyone in his office to contact the registrar of the Special Criminal Court or the Department of Justice.  Does the Minister of State want to convey to the House  the meaning that nothing was done to check the Attorney General's doubts at the time? \n Mr. Carey  The Attorney General wrote to the Minister for Justice.  The information known to him at that stage raised doubts rather than obvious implications.  The Attorney General acted properly in the matter. \n An Ceann Comhairle  I am not going to dwell unduly long on this question.  There are many other questions on the Order Paper and I will be moving to them shortly. \n Mr. O'Donoghue  Can the Minister of State shed any light on why the Attorney General in his letter to the Minister for Justice on 1 November set out advice on the consequences of the improper composition of the Special Criminal Court?  Why did he think it necessary to include advice in that letter?  Did the Attorney General contact the Chief State Solicitor's office after he read the report referred to in Deputy McDowell's question? \n Mr. Carey  The Attorney General wrote to the Minister for Justice on the basis of the information known to him, which at that stage raised doubts rather than obvious implications.  If the letter explained the consequences of his doubts—— \n Mr. D. Ahern  A newly qualified solicitor would have known about it. \n Mr. Carey  That is fair comment, I will not dispute that. \n Mr. D. Ahern  I am glad the Minister of State admits that. \n Mr. Carey  Deputy McDowell was also offered this facility.  Deputies Bertie Ahern and Harney withdrew their questions.  If the Deputy wants to get more extensive answers, he should table the question to the Taoiseach.  This matter has been debated at length and all the answers have been given. \n Mrs. O'Rourke  They have not. \n Mr. Carey  Nothing has been left untold. \n Mr. M. McDowell  On a point of order, since the Minister of State courteously suggested I should table the question directly to the Taoiseach, I would be happy to withdraw it and retable it to the Taoiseach next week. \n Mr. Carey  I do not know if the Deputy can do that now. \n Mr. M. McDowell  Did the Minister of State not make that offer? \n An Ceann Comhairle  I will not give a commitment in the matter.  As I have said on many occasions, if Members are dissatisfied with Ministers' replies, they have a remedy.  My office will consider the matter, if the question is posed along those lines. \n Mr. M. McDowell  Obviously the Minister of State has been given only limited information to deal with this question and I accept he is doing his best to be helpful to the House, but he invited me not to pursue the matter now on the basis that I can pursue it with the Taoiseach later.  I would be happy to do that, but the Taoiseach might not be as generous as the Minister of State and might ask the Chair to disallow my question on the basis that it was a repeat. \n An Ceann Comhairle  The Chair rules on matters which are directly before it, not on hypotheses. \n Mr. R. Burke  I accept it is not up to you, Sir, to ensure that Ministers answer adequately.  As the Minister of State said he cannot answer all the Deputies' questions and suggested that they should be tabled again next week, there is a reasonable case for acceding to Deputy McDowell's request to defer his question until next week when the Taoiseach can respond.  On behalf of this side of the House, I appeal for a clear indication that this question can be tabled next week and that all similar questions will not be ruled out of order. \n An Ceann Comhairle  On that basis I will proceed to Question No. 2.

McDowell asked the Minister for Tourism and Trade whether the separate independent cost-benefit analysis of the RDS National Conference Centre proposal has been made available to him; if so, the action, if any, he proposes to take in the matter; whether the findings of this analysis will be made public; and if he will make a statement on the matter.\n      [22045/96] ",
        "answerText": " Mr. O'Sullivan  I propose to take Questions Nos. 38, 80 and 93 together.  As the Deputies are aware the Operational Programme for Tourism 1994-99, makes provision for European Regional Development Fund support for a large dedicated conference centre to be built in Dublin and capable of handling up to 2,000 delegates.  Following the failure of the open tendering competition to produce an acceptable private sector proposal, an alternative strategy was pursued whereby Bord Fáilte under the aegis of the independent management board for product development, examined an outline proposal from the Royal Dublin Society which, as a voluntary body, is potentially eligible for consideration for a higher rate of capital assistance normally reserved under the tourism operational programme for public and similar bodies.  Upon completion of their examination of the RDS proposal Bord Fáilte, on the recommendation of the product board, commissioned an independent cost-benefit analysis which is required under the tourism operational programme in the case of all large projects.  This was undertaken by an experienced UK consultancy firm, ECOTEC, which was selected by Bord Fáilte on the basis of a competitive tendering procedure. Reports of this nature would not normally be made public as they contain information of a commercially sensitive nature.  The Government, having taken into account a number of factors including the recommendations of the Product Board and Bord Fáilte and the results of the cost-benefit analysis, agreed on 5 November 1996 to make a submission to the European Commission recommending formal approval of the proposed development by the RDS.  The Government is recommending approval of 75 per cent capital grant aid subject to the existing financial provision for such project in the current tourism operational programme.  I understand this provision is already adequate to fully meet the total cost of grant recommended in the Government's submission and will not necessitate any change in priorities or budgets in the current operational programme.  The proposal has now been submitted to the European Commission for its formal agreement which is required under the operational programme for projects of this scale.  We await a formal response from the Commission and in the interim, I do not propose to anticipate or speculate on the substance of that response.  A specific timeframe for commencement or completion of the national conference centre project cannot be determined until a proposal has been formally approved by the European Commission and matters such as planning permission are in place. There is, however, no reason to believe the project cannot be completed and supported within the timeframe permissible under the operational programme.  I am not aware of any formal legal actions pending against the State following the decision to terminate the open tendering competition for the national conference centre. \n Mr. Killeen  It is not clear from the Minister of State's reply whether the RDS has already been found to be eligible for the higher rate of European funding.  I expect it has not yet been found  eligible.  Does the Minister agree it is a great pity that contracts for consultancy reports such as the cost-benefit analysis have to be placed outside the country?  We have had many examples of it in several Departments in recent times.  It is a pity that we are not able to do this work ourselves and keep within the country the very substantial amounts of finance involved.  Does the Minister agree the Government ought to have a fall back position in mind in the event that any of the myriad difficulties which might beset the RDS proposal come into play?  I understand there may well be difficulties in relation to the local community.  There may be planning difficulties and perhaps even a failure to get the level of European funding which is expected.  As I understand it from the Minister, if that happened, the conference centre proposal would effectively collapse.  Am I correct in understanding that? \n Mr. O'Sullivan  In answer to the Deputy's first question, we no longer have any choice in these matters.

        "questionNumber": 93,
        "answerText": " Mr. O'Sullivan  I propose to take Questions Nos. 38, 80 and 93 together.  As the Deputies are aware the Operational Programme for Tourism 1994-99, makes provision for European Regional Development Fund support for a large dedicated conference centre to be built in Dublin and capable of handling up to 2,000 delegates.  Following the failure of the open tendering competition to produce an acceptable private sector proposal, an alternative strategy was pursued whereby Bord Fáilte under the aegis of the independent management board for product development, examined an outline proposal from the Royal Dublin Society which, as a voluntary body, is potentially eligible for consideration for a higher rate of capital assistance normally reserved under the tourism operational programme for public and similar bodies.  Upon completion of their examination of the RDS proposal Bord Fáilte, on the recommendation of the product board, commissioned an independent cost-benefit analysis which is required under the tourism operational programme in the case of all large projects.  This was undertaken by an experienced UK consultancy firm, ECOTEC, which was selected by Bord Fáilte on the basis of a competitive tendering procedure. Reports of this nature would not normally be made public as they contain information of a commercially sensitive nature.  The Government, having taken into account a number of factors including the recommendations of the Product Board and Bord Fáilte and the results of the cost-benefit analysis, agreed on 5 November 1996 to make a submission to the European Commission recommending formal approval of the proposed development by the RDS.  The Government is recommending approval of 75 per cent capital grant aid subject to the existing financial provision for such project in the current tourism operational programme.  I understand this provision is already adequate to fully meet the total cost of grant recommended in the Government's submission and will not necessitate any change in priorities or budgets in the current operational programme.  The proposal has now been submitted to the European Commission for its formal agreement which is required under the operational programme for projects of this scale.  We await a formal response from the Commission and in the interim, I do not propose to anticipate or speculate on the substance of that response.  A specific timeframe for commencement or completion of the national conference centre project cannot be determined until a proposal has been formally approved by the European Commission and matters such as planning permission are in place. There is, however, no reason to believe the project cannot be completed and supported within the timeframe permissible under the operational programme.  I am not aware of any formal legal actions pending against the State following the decision to terminate the open tendering competition for the national conference centre. \n Mr. Killeen  It is not clear from the Minister of State's reply whether the RDS has already been found to be eligible for the higher rate of European funding.  I expect it has not yet been found  eligible.  Does the Minister agree it is a great pity that contracts for consultancy reports such as the cost-benefit analysis have to be placed outside the country?  We have had many examples of it in several Departments in recent times.  It is a pity that we are not able to do this work ourselves and keep within the country the very substantial amounts of finance involved.  Does the Minister agree the Government ought to have a fall back position in mind in the event that any of the myriad difficulties which might beset the RDS proposal come into play?  I understand there may well be difficulties in relation to the local community.  There may be planning difficulties and perhaps even a failure to get the level of European funding which is expected.  As I understand it from the Minister, if that happened, the conference centre proposal would effectively collapse.  Am I correct in understanding that? \n Mr. O'Sullivan  In answer to the Deputy's first question, we no longer have any choice in these matters.  We are now part of the European Union and it is necessary to advertise internationally when we advertise these contracts.  Does the Deputy agree that if the Government had decided on a fall back position, we would have to go to Europe and say that although we are making a submission on behalf of the RDS, in case it is not successful we have another proposal?  Does he agree that it would undermine our position and send out the wrong signals?  I think it would. \n Mr. Killeen  The Minister is confident. \n Mr. O'Sullivan  We are very confident. ",

        "answerText": " Mr. Taylor  I propose to take Questions Nos. 5 and 15 together.  The establishment of adequate facilities to assist in alleviating the difficulties and traumas of couples who are experiencing difficulties in their marriage, has always been a concern of mine.  On my appointment as Minister for Equality and Law Reform I was determined to give practical effect to that concern.  Accordingly, I accorded permanent status to the family mediation service which, since its establishment in 1986, had operated on a pilot basis with no certainty of permanence.  Also, I instituted a scheme of grants for voluntary organisations which provide counselling to couples who are experiencing difficulties in their marriage.  My Department commenced funding marriage counselling organisations in 1994.  Prior to then grants to these organisations were administered by the Department of Health and from time to time supplementary grants were paid by the Department of Social Welfare.  In 1993, for example, approximately £300,000 was allocated by these Departments to voluntary counselling groups.  In 1994 and again in 1995 my Department  paid out £750,000 in grants to such groups and £900,000 is available for distribution in 1996. Also, the scheme has been extended this year to include the provision of assistance to organisations providing counselling to children of parents who had separated.  Significant tangible benefits have accrued from the scheme of grants to counselling organisations. Premises and facilities have been improved as has training for counsellors and supervisors.  The total number of counselling hours provided by grantaided organisations has increased from 44,166 hours in 1993 to 69,703 hours in 1995.  There has also been a very significant increase in pre-marriage courses over the years.  The provision of significant and regular funding will facilitate further improvements in the provision of counselling services to couples and children.  The family mediation service operated by my Department is a professional confidential service which enables couples, who have decided to separate or who have already separated, to negotiate their own separation agreement with the help of a trained mediator, without resorting to adjudication through the courts.  All issues are included in the negotiations, such as ongoing parenting of the children, the family home, family finances. pensions property and any other relevant issues relevant to the separation.  As part of a programme for development and expansion of the family mediation service, two new posts of area mediation co-ordinator have been created, one for the existing family mediation service centre at the Irish Life Mall, Lower Abbey Street, Dublin and one for the new centre at Mill House, Henry Street, Limerick. Competitions to select suitable people for these positions have been held under the auspices of the Civil Service Commission and appointments are imminent.  The persons appointed will be responsible for the delivery of a quality mediation service, with the assistance of a team of mediators. each for his or her own geographical areas of responsibility.  The appointment of area mediation co-ordinators will facilitate the establishment of a scheme for the use of mediators in private practice, who have the necessary training and experience and otherwise meet the standards set by the family mediation service, to provide family mediation at locations distant from a family mediation centre or to relieve the pressure on the centres at Dublin and Limerick.  The allocation of cases to private mediators would be done through the family mediation service.  Deputies can rest assured that I will continue in my endeavours to ensure that quality counselling and mediation services are available for the future and that adequate funding is made available to this end. \n Ms Keogh  I agree that adequate funding should be made available for mediation and counselling services.  What is the position regarding the centre in Limerick?  Are there any  projections on needs over the coming 12 months in relation to the number of cases or is this being done on an affordability basis rather than on the basis of presentation of cases? \n Mr. Taylor  It is difficult to assess the number of cases.  We are expanding the service.  New staff have been taken on and the Limerick centre is new.  Regrettably, the number of marriage breakdowns is increasing substantially so there is a need for this service.  One anticipates it will be an increasing phenomenon.  Mediation is a very important service as it enables many couples to avoid having recourse to the courts with the trauma, expense and delay that involves.  Research also shows this is desirable in that when a separation arrangement is negotiated voluntarily between the parties through mediation, it has greater chance of being respected in all its aspects than one imposed by a court.  I have always regarded the provision of a mediation service as important.  That is the reason I secured the necessary finance for the second centre in Limerick.  I will complete the arrangements as soon as possible to avail of the services of private mediators in other locations. Unfortunately, there are not too many.  Those who are available and suitably qualified and who are prepared to participate in this arrangement through the family mediation service will be placed on its books and their services will be availed of. \n Dr. Woods  The Minister said there was an increase of more than 50 per cent in the hours of counselling between 1993 and 1995.  Has the Minister estimated the increase for next year? The Family Law (Divorce) Bill, 1996, comes back to the House from the Seanad next week. Presumably, it will go to the President for signature.  Within a short time its provisions will be implemented.  Has the Minister estimated the level of counselling which will need to be provided after the Bill is passed when there will be an expected increase in the number seeking counselling? \n Mr. Taylor  It is always difficult to forecast the level of marriage breakdown and the requirement for counselling services.  There has been a substantial improvement in facilities available due to the increase in grants.  The number of hours I mentioned were for 1995.  I imagine the number of hours that will be availed of will be even greater in 1996.  This is something which my Department will have to monitor carefully as time goes by.  We are in close consultation with the marriage counselling organisations which do remarkable work, mainly voluntary.  We will review the situation from time to time and make whatever arrangements are reasonably possible and necessary.  Marriage counselling arose in the context of marriage breakdown rather than divorce which will add a new dimension to the situation.  The  unavailability of a divorce jurisdiction, did not stop marriages breaking down in increasing numbers in the years for which we have statistics. The marriage counselling organisations have been addressing that.  By and large, they are reasonably content with the level of funding and assistance we have given them in the past couple of years.  That is not to say we provide enough. No matter how much one provides in such a situation, more can always be used.  We have a good relationship with these organisations and they appreciate the funding we have made available to them.  It has enabled them to make sea changes in the service they provide not only in the hours of service delivered but also in the quality and calibre of service.  They have used part of the grant money to improve the level of training and expertise of counsellors, which is important.  Not only has the volume of the service increased, but so too has the quality.  The organisations are anxious to provide the most professional counsellors. \n Mr. S. Ryan  I compliment the Minister on the increased allocation to marriage counselling and mediation services.  We must acknowledge that funding increased from £300,000 to £900,000 between 1993 to 1996.  We are talking, to a large extent, about marriage breakdown and what happens after that.  Will the Minister outline what grants are available to improve pre-marriage counselling and advice services to ensure those getting married know what they face? \n Mr. Taylor  Most of the organisations provide pre-marriage counselling as well as counselling to couples whose marriages are in difficulty or have broken down.  Another factor which has been introduced following consultation is the question of counselling for children.  That is something which Deputy Woods, in particular, will welcome as it is an issue on which he has focused.  It is nice to be able to tell the House that it is an increasingly important aspect of the work of counselling organisations.  As regards the money available, £900,000 is available for distribution in 1996 to the marriage counselling organisations.  I cannot say what the figure will be in 1997 as it has not been determined.  A large number of counselling organisations have been grant aided, the largest being ACCORD which is a nationwide organisations.  ACCORD provides an excellent professional service at various locations.  Other organisations are locally based in Cork and elsewhere.  There is a long list of organisations and we do the best we can for them in recognition of the remarkable service which so many who work in them provide voluntarily.  They deserve our thanks and appreciation for that work. \n Mr. Kenneally  I welcome the increase in funding for marriage counselling.  Do we place too much emphasis on family mediation rather  than on marriage counselling?  Most or all the funding for marriage counselling goes to voluntary bodies.  However, the Government is setting up family mediation agencies.  More emphasis should be placed on trying to keep marriages together.  As Deputy Woods said, there was an increase of more than 50 per cent in hours between 1993 and 1995.  I notice that in the same period funding increased by 150 per cent.  Why has there not been a corresponding increase in the number of hours?  The Minister spoke about the improved quality of the service.  How does his Department monitor that and ensure a quality service?  The Minister said one of the problems in the family mediation area is the lack of qualified professionals.  Are there any plans in place to provide additional training so that we will have more professional mediators? \n Mr. Taylor  There are no immediate plans for a further family mediation centre.  The centre in Limerick is the first to be opened since the original formation of the family mediation service with its initial centre in Dublin.  My concern is to get the Limerick centre operating and also the scheme involving the private mediators.  When that operation is in place and working well we can reassess the situation.  By that time the divorce jurisdiction will be operational and we can see if any further expansion is required, appropriate or possible in the context of the availability of the trained mediators without whom none of this could operate.  The question of training of mediators is not a matter for my Department but the national organisation is doing its best in this regard.  The main advantage of having the additional centre in Limerick is that it and the Dublin centre will be a source of training and practical experience for new mediators because the people working there will have the opportunity to gain the necessary practice and experience.  One can have all the education one likes but without the practical experience on the ground of dealing with these cases, the full benefit cannot be achieved from it.  For the information of Members who are obviously interested in the whole mediation concept, I thought I knew something about this but I was taken aback when I visited the Family Mediation Centre in Dublin at the remarkable way in which the system operates.  One would think that a couple goes in for an hour or two but it is not at all like that.  for each couple it is an extraordinarily extensive process involving six hours or more.  Every aspect of the family is examined — children, pensions, income, property division and so on.  Every detail of the marriage is gone through in a relaxed manner and with great care.  That is a time consuming operation and one can imagine the great skill that is required on the part of the mediators.  It is an excellent State service.  Deputy Kenneally wanted to know the reason the number of hours available has not increased  pro rata with the additional grant aid.  That is not an easy question to answer and there may be various explanations for it.  The range and type of counselling is expanding.  Pre-marriage counselling and counselling for children is on the increase and the quality of the service is improving.  Greater effort is being applied, and they are right in this regard, by the marriage counselling organisations to additional training for counsellors because great skill is required on their part, not quite to the same level as applies to mediators, but it is nonetheless of importance in the critical work they do. \n Dr. Woods  The Minister told us he cannot say how much the Government will allocate to this service next year, and I appreciate that is a matter for the forthcoming Estimate, but I asked him to indicate the estimated requirement for next year. His Department must have done some calculation on this.  We have told the public we are concerned about this matter and that we will try to anticipate their needs and meet them accordingly.  Has the Minister's Department done any work on estimating the needs in mediation for next year?  I assume that has been done and that there is an estimate of the demand because the new legislation will be enacted next year and it is therefore a critical issue. \n Mr. Taylor  The marriage counselling organisations carry out their own assessments of requirements and submit their applications to my Department for grant aid to enable them meet those requirements.  As far as I know the demands on the voluntary marriage counselling organisations are met and any person who requires counselling can have reasonably ready access to that service by one or other of the counselling organisations.  That is something they keep under review and we are in consultation with them on it.  The counselling requirement is reasonably met by the voluntary organisations with the assistance of the grant aid we provide.  I do not have a particular calculation of the estimated number of marriage breakdowns in the years ahead but it is substantial and that is the reason substantially increased funding has been provided by my Department for that purpose. That position will be kept under ongoing review. \n Ms Keogh  I suggest to the Minister that not only should there be an examination of the numbers of people who might approach counselling services but his Department should have a role in calculating the current waiting period for those services.  I was on the executive of a marriage counselling service and we were of the view that the quicker people availed of a counselling service, the better chance they had of some type of reconciliation.  The earlier the intervention, the better are the prospects for the future.  Is it proposed, either by the Minister's Department or the Department of Health, to have a register of mediators and to have some  acknowledgment of the level of training required in this area?  Is that currently monitored and, if not, will it be monitored in the future? \n Mr. Taylor  As I understand it there is currently no statutory base for the professional mediator but the national organisation operates some system in that regard on an ad hoc basis to which its own members are affiliated.  I do not know the standards it applies; that possibly comes under the ambit of another Minister.  I do not have a particular role although I accepted an amendment in the Seanad yesterday that will enable me to make regulations in that regard. That is something which may arise at a later stage but it does not arise now. ",

McDowell asked the Minister for Finance the estimated cost to the Exchequer of a three year public sector wage deal in the order of 10.5 per cent; and whether he will make a statement on the implications, if any, of such an increase in gross public sector pay on tax policy.\n      [20435/96] ",
        "answerText": " Mr. Quinn  The main focus in the negotiation of the pay arrangements to follow the Programme for Competitiveness and Work will be competitiveness, which is the key to economic growth, employment and social progress.  Against that background the aim will be to achieve pay moderation and certainty of pay costs, supported by reductions in taxation.  Taxation is intrinsically tied in with the level of public expenditure, of which the public service pay and pensions bill is a major factor.  An increase of 10.5 per cent in public service pay would add an estimated £505 million per year to that bill.  Such an increase, as well as any other additional expenditure commitments sought in the context of a new programme, would, obviously, restrict the resources available for taxation. \n Mr. M. McDowell  Does the £505 million include pensions which would flow from such a rate of public sector pay increases?  Is it not the case that a 10.5 per cent pay deal over three years would impose a cost on the Exchequer well in excess of £1.5 billion? \n Mr. Quinn  I cannot give the Deputy an answer to his first question.  I suspect the figure is not inclusive.  That information is not in the brief before me, but I will supply it to the Deputy.  Will he repeat his second question? \n Mr. M. McDowell  Does this mean that over three years we are dealing with a £1.5 billion projected increase in expenditure in public service pay, if a deal of that kind was made? \n Mr. Quinn  I am glad the Deputy added the conditional clause, \"if a deal of that kind was made\".  I can assure him that the detailed negotiations of a successor agreement to the existing Programme for Competitiveness and Work have only commenced and the question posed and costs associated with it will be of considerable assistance to the social partners. \n Mr. M. McDowell  Will the Minister agree that if instead of concentrating on gross pay increases of £1.5 billion over three years we concentrated our efforts on tax reductions for everybody, both in the public and private sectors, real take home pay could increase and the scope for tax  reductions over those three years would be huge compared with anything that could be possibly contemplated if public sector trade unions demand a gross increase of £1.5 billion over those three years? \n Mr. Quinn  The presentation yesterday by the second secretary in the Department of Finance, Mr. Tutty, to the social partners outlined clearly the advances made over the past three years within which a clear link was drawn between economic growth brought about by an improved competitive position and enhanced take home pay, including tax reductions.  There is a quantifiable lesson in that for everybody, irrespective of where they work or would like to work in our economy, that a combination of pay moderation and real tax reductions can leave money in people's pockets and can enhance the prospects of the economy.  I agree with the Deputy that provided we can get that message across, how we share the cake becomes a secondary issue.  The proof is in the existing agreement which delivered far more than anybody would have thought or was projected by the previous second secretary now the secretary of the Department, Mr. Mullarkey, when he made a similar presentation three years ago to a similar group of social partners. \n Mr. M. McDowell  Will the Minister agree it is not simply a matter of £505 million pounds in each year, if we are talking about a 3.5 per cent pay deal for each of the three years, because implicit in that deal is local and specialised wage bargaining, special cases and some form of negotiation on productivity and the like?  Will he take this opportunity to indicate that kind of demand as an opening shot in a negotiation is totally inconsistent with making any significant progress over the next three years on tax reform? \n Mr. Quinn  The Deputy in using the clause, \"that type of demand as an opening shot\", has perhaps answered his question.  I do not want to prejudice the outcome of the negotiations, but I will repeat what I said at the initial meeting of the social partners held in Dublin Castle on 23 October.  As Minister with responsibility for the wider public service, including civil servants, and as an employer acting on behalf of the taxpayer, my experience of the local bargaining clauses in the public sector under the Programme for Competitiveness and Work has been far from satisfactory.  Experience of the existing agreement must and will inform our attitude to any new agreement in regard to such types of subsidiary arrangements other than the headline agreement that might be arrived at.

        "questionNumber": 17,
        "answerText": " Mr. Quinn  The main focus in the negotiation of the pay arrangements to follow the Programme for Competitiveness and Work will be competitiveness, which is the key to economic growth, employment and social progress.  Against that background the aim will be to achieve pay moderation and certainty of pay costs, supported by reductions in taxation.  Taxation is intrinsically tied in with the level of public expenditure, of which the public service pay and pensions bill is a major factor.  An increase of 10.5 per cent in public service pay would add an estimated £505 million per year to that bill.  Such an increase, as well as any other additional expenditure commitments sought in the context of a new programme, would, obviously, restrict the resources available for taxation. \n Mr. M. McDowell  Does the £505 million include pensions which would flow from such a rate of public sector pay increases?  Is it not the case that a 10.5 per cent pay deal over three years would impose a cost on the Exchequer well in excess of £1.5 billion? \n Mr. Quinn  I cannot give the Deputy an answer to his first question.  I suspect the figure is not inclusive.  That information is not in the brief before me, but I will supply it to the Deputy.  Will he repeat his second question? \n Mr. M. McDowell  Does this mean that over three years we are dealing with a £1.5 billion projected increase in expenditure in public service pay, if a deal of that kind was made? \n Mr. Quinn  I am glad the Deputy added the conditional clause, \"if a deal of that kind was made\".  I can assure him that the detailed negotiations of a successor agreement to the existing Programme for Competitiveness and Work have only commenced and the question posed and costs associated with it will be of considerable assistance to the social partners. \n Mr. M. McDowell  Will the Minister agree that if instead of concentrating on gross pay increases of £1.5 billion over three years we concentrated our efforts on tax reductions for everybody, both in the public and private sectors, real take home pay could increase and the scope for tax  reductions over those three years would be huge compared with anything that could be possibly contemplated if public sector trade unions demand a gross increase of £1.5 billion over those three years? \n Mr. Quinn  The presentation yesterday by the second secretary in the Department of Finance, Mr. Tutty, to the social partners outlined clearly the advances made over the past three years within which a clear link was drawn between economic growth brought about by an improved competitive position and enhanced take home pay, including tax reductions.  There is a quantifiable lesson in that for everybody, irrespective of where they work or would like to work in our economy, that a combination of pay moderation and real tax reductions can leave money in people's pockets and can enhance the prospects of the economy.  I agree with the Deputy that provided we can get that message across, how we share the cake becomes a secondary issue.  The proof is in the existing agreement which delivered far more than anybody would have thought or was projected by the previous second secretary now the secretary of the Department, Mr. Mullarkey, when he made a similar presentation three years ago to a similar group of social partners. \n Mr. M. McDowell  Will the Minister agree it is not simply a matter of £505 million pounds in each year, if we are talking about a 3.5 per cent pay deal for each of the three years, because implicit in that deal is local and specialised wage bargaining, special cases and some form of negotiation on productivity and the like?  Will he take this opportunity to indicate that kind of demand as an opening shot in a negotiation is totally inconsistent with making any significant progress over the next three years on tax reform? \n Mr. Quinn  The Deputy in using the clause, \"that type of demand as an opening shot\", has perhaps answered his question.  I do not want to prejudice the outcome of the negotiations, but I will repeat what I said at the initial meeting of the social partners held in Dublin Castle on 23 October.  As Minister with responsibility for the wider public service, including civil servants, and as an employer acting on behalf of the taxpayer, my experience of the local bargaining clauses in the public sector under the Programme for Competitiveness and Work has been far from satisfactory.  Experience of the existing agreement must and will inform our attitude to any new agreement in regard to such types of subsidiary arrangements other than the headline agreement that might be arrived at.

McDowell asked the Minister for Finance the estimated cost to the Exchequer of a three year public sector wage deal in the order of 10.5 per cent; and whether he will make a statement on the implications, if any, of such an increase in gross public sector pay on tax policy.\n      [20435/96] ",

McDowell asked the Minister for Education the analysis or study of the cost implications for the Exchequer, if any, her Department has carried out on the proposed establishment of regional education boards; if so, whether such an analysis or study has been tendered to the Department of Finance; and if she will make a statement on the matter.\n      [16764/96] ",
        "answerText": " Ms Bhreathnach:  I propose to take Questions Nos. 9 and 34 together.  As already confirmed by the Minister for Finance in his reply to Deputy O'Donnell on 24 May 1995 and by myself in my reply to Deputy Martin on 28 September 1995, the cost implications of implementing the education reform proposals, including the cost of establishing the education boards, were considered as part of the process of finalising the White Paper on Education.  The Minister for Finance and his officials participated in that process.  The White Paper on Education, Charting Our Education Future, makes  clear that the establishment of education boards will take place on a phased basis, following the enactment of the necessary legislation.  The gradual transfer of functions to the boards will facilitate careful appraisal of the incremental costs in the context of the Education Estimates for the year in question, within the overall context of the budgetary parameters approved by Government.  The establishment of the boards will also bring significant benefits for the administration and effectiveness of education services, through improved regional planning and co-ordination and the provision of support services to primary and secondary schools in the most cost-effective way.  The establishment of the education boards will involve changing the administrative framework for education.  It will not result in a completely new area of expenditure but rather will involve the reallocation of funding and administrative responsibilities within the education system.  As Deputies are aware, costing exercises can depend on many variable factors.  These factors include the startup time of an initiative, the timescale within which a proposal is implemented, the outcome of discussions/negotiations with concerned interests, expert advice on the detailed implementation strategies and the final administrative and operational arrangements.  The operational cost of the education boards, like the costs of many education reform measures, will be determined to a large extent by pay costs.  These in turn would reflect the numbers employed by the board and pay rates at any given time.  It would not be useful or appropriate for me to comment now on what the various elements of new administrative structures might cost at some time in the future. \n Ms Keogh:  I should answer this question since the Minister for Education could not.  She said it would not be useful or appropriate to speculate on what this could possibly cost in the future  when it might get off the ground.  In other words, she has announced a whole policy area and has no idea whatsoever of the cost or when it will start.  She cannot answer this question.  The answer to this question, if I may be so bold, is that a cost analysis has not been done.  The Minister is expecting to embark on a change in policy in relation to education that is far reaching and does not think it would be useful or appropriate to dwell on what it would cost us.  Will the Minister devote more time to identifying what needs to be done within the education system to better the education of our children and less time on looking at structures which it appears she will not be able to implement because she will not be here to do it? \n Ms Bhreathnach:  I would remind the Deputy of what the education boards are about.  We are looking at an education system which since the beginning of the State has been centralised in the Department of Education in Marlborough Street.  That involves the day to day running of 3,600 primary schools and three different kinds of second level schools and post-leaving certificate activity.  Our education system has been subject to detailed examination not only from within the State but by agencies outside the State.  It has been recommended on more than one occasion by various Governments that the education system should be regionalised instead of administered by a central Department in Marlborough Street.  We are not setting out to put an alternative structure in place or to create ten Departments of Education.  We are responding to informed criticism, debate and advice.  It is proposed to establish on a regional basis the services administered by the Department of Education.  As I said in my reply, the main cost in the Department is teachers' pay.  The establishment of ten boards will not take teachers off the payroll.  Consideration is being given to the role of the education board and the regionalisation of the inspectorate and psychological  services so as to meet the needs of the community. \n Mr. Martin:  There is no psychological service. \n An Leas-Cheann Comhairle:  Let us hear the Minister's reply. \n Ms Bhreathnach:  In my reply to a later question I will detail what is in the service.  It seems from the questions that the Deputies were unaware of the earlier debate and advice about the structure of the Department of Education. \n Miss Coughlan:  The questions relate to the cost. \n Ms Bhreathnach:  The preamble to the White Paper deals with the Education Vote and the increase in the level of investment in education in recent years. \n Mr. Martin:  The Minister is talking around the question. \n Ms Bhreathnach:  We are looking at the Department's role in the administration of the education system.  I have committed myself to the publication of legislation.  The education system needs to be established on a regional basis. \n Mr. Martin:  The Minister has been asked this question on a number of occasions but has refused to outline the cost implications, if any, of the establishment of regional education boards or to say whether an analysis has been undertaken and submitted to the Department of Finance.  The Minister has consistently withheld information on this issue from the House by refusing to outline the details of this scheme. \n Ms Bhreathnach:  Accusations. \n Mr. Martin:  The Minister should be more transparent on this issue than she has been to date. \n Mr. D. Wallace:  What defects in the administration of the education system does the Minister hope to rectify through the establishment of the regional education boards and in what way will these boards be more cost efficient than the current arrangements? \n Ms Bhreathnach:  The recommendation was made following consultation with the partners in education over a number of years.  The answers to the Deputies' questions can be found in the White Paper to which I refer them. \n Mr. Martin:  The answers are not in the White Paper. \n An Leas-Cheann Comhairle:  That concludes questions for today.

The Minister is expecting to embark on a change in policy in relation to education that is far reaching and does not think it would be useful or appropriate to dwell on what it would cost us.  Will the Minister devote more time to identifying what needs to be done within the education system to better the education of our children and less time on looking at structures which it appears she will not be able to implement because she will not be here to do it? \n Ms Bhreathnach:  I would remind the Deputy of what the education boards are about.  We are looking at an education system which since the beginning of the State has been centralised in the Department of Education in Marlborough Street.  That involves the day to day running of 3,600 primary schools and three different kinds of second level schools and post-leaving certificate activity.  Our education system has been subject to detailed examination not only from within the State but by agencies outside the State.  It has been recommended on more than one occasion by various Governments that the education system should be regionalised instead of administered by a central Department in Marlborough Street.  We are not setting out to put an alternative structure in place or to create ten Departments of Education.  We are responding to informed criticism, debate and advice.  It is proposed to establish on a regional basis the services administered by the Department of Education.  As I said in my reply, the main cost in the Department is teachers' pay.  The establishment of ten boards will not take teachers off the payroll.  Consideration is being given to the role of the education board and the regionalisation of the inspectorate and psychological  services so as to meet the needs of the community. \n Mr. Martin:  There is no psychological service. \n An Leas-Cheann Comhairle:  Let us hear the Minister's reply. \n Ms Bhreathnach:  In my reply to a later question I will detail what is in the service.  It seems from the questions that the Deputies were unaware of the earlier debate and advice about the structure of the Department of Education. \n Miss Coughlan:  The questions relate to the cost. \n Ms Bhreathnach:  The preamble to the White Paper deals with the Education Vote and the increase in the level of investment in education in recent years. \n Mr. Martin:  The Minister is talking around the question. \n Ms Bhreathnach:  We are looking at the Department's role in the administration of the education system.  I have committed myself to the publication of legislation.  The education system needs to be established on a regional basis. \n Mr. Martin:  The Minister has been asked this question on a number of occasions but has refused to outline the cost implications, if any, of the establishment of regional education boards or to say whether an analysis has been undertaken and submitted to the Department of Finance.  The Minister has consistently withheld information on this issue from the House by refusing to outline the details of this scheme. \n Ms Bhreathnach:  Accusations. \n Mr. Martin:  The Minister should be more transparent on this issue than she has been to date. \n Mr. D. Wallace:  What defects in the administration of the education system does the Minister hope to rectify through the establishment of the regional education boards and in what way will these boards be more cost efficient than the current arrangements? \n Ms Bhreathnach:  The recommendation was made following consultation with the partners in education over a number of years.  The answers to the Deputies' questions can be found in the White Paper to which I refer them. \n Mr. Martin:  The answers are not in the White Paper. \n An Leas-Cheann Comhairle:  That concludes questions for today.

Faoi mar a cuireadh in iúl don Teach mar fhreagra ar Cheist Uimh 12 ar 14 Márta, ar Cheisteanna Uimh.  23 agus 28 ar 12 Meitheamh, ar Cheisteanna Uimh. 166 agus 167 ar 18 Meitheamh agus ar Cheist Uimh 291 ar 25 Iúil 1996, níl soláthar i Vóta mo Roinne i mbliana le haghaidh caiteachais ar bhóithre sa Ghaeltacht.  Ar ndóigh, is ceist go príomha don Roinn Comhshaoil agus do na Comhairlí Contae iomchuí í staid na mbóithre sa Ghaeltacht.  Gheall mé níos luaithe i mbliana go mbreithneofaí an scéal tuilleadh, i gcomhairle leis an Aire Airgeadais, féachaint an dtig linn soláthar éigin a chur ar fáil i mbliana chun bóithre áise agus bóithre portaigh sa Ghaeltacht a fheabhsú nuair a bheadh cúrsaí níos soiléire maidir le caiteachas mo Roinne i 1996 ar Scéimeanna Feabhsúcháin sa Ghaeltacht.  Mar thoradh ar an mbreithniú sin, meastar go gcaithfear ina iomlán, ar  thograí atá ceadaithe cheana féin, an soláthar méadaithe atá ar fáil i mbliana le caitheamh ar Scéimeanna Feabhsúcháin sa Ghaeltacht.  Mar sin ní bheidh airgead ar fáil i mbliana ó mo Roinnse le caitheamh ar bhóithre sa Ghaeltacht.  Coimeádfar an cheist faoi bhreithniú i gcónaí féachaint an mbeidh athrú ar an scéal idir seo agus deireadh na bliana. \n Éamon Ó Cuiv  Tá an-diomá orm, a Leas-Cheann Comhairle, tar éis an méid seo ama go bhfuil muid ar deireadh ag fáil fírinne an scéil seo: nach mbeidh airgead ar fáil do bhóithre áise i 1996 ón Aire.  Cuireann sé iontas orm freisin agus an bhféadfadh an tAire a dheimhniú gur iarradh ar na Comhairlí Contae i lár an tsamhraidh moltaí a chur ar aghaidh ag an Roinn maidir le caiteachas airgid ar bhóithre áise i mbliana agus má iarradh an teolas sin cén fáth ar iarradh é muna raibh airgead a dhul a bheith ar fáil?  Nó an iarracht a bhí ann muintir na Gaeltachta a chur amú uair amháin eile?  An bhféadfadh an tAire a rá liom freisin cé mhéad iarratas atá faighte ag a Roinn i mbliana fé Scéim na mBóithre Áise 1996?  An bhfuil an Roinn fós ag glacadh iarratais ina leith? \n Mr. M. Higgins  Táim ag ullmhú meastachán don bhliain seo chughainn agus beidh mé ag déanamh iarracht freastal ar na riachtanais atá ann i leith bóithre áise agus bóithre portaigh.  An rud a bhí uaim nuair a rinne mo Roinn teangmháil leis na húdaráis áitiúla ná fáil amach céard go beacht an riachtanas a bhí ann le scéim cheart a chumadh.  Rud eile atá tábhachtach ná go ndearna mé féin leasú ar an scéim a bhí ann.  Chun an gné polaitiúil a thógaint as, bhí gá le hairgead do ghnéithe eile de chursaí feabhsúcháin ach é sin ráite táim ag ullmhú na figiúirí chun freastal ar na riachtanais chearta atá ann, b'fhéidir.  Agus tá riachtanais ann.  Má táthar chun é sin a dhéanamh caithfear dul i gcomhairle le húdaráis eile, na comhairlí contae san áireamh. \n Éamon Ó Cuív  Nuair a chuathas i gcomhairle leis na comhairlí contae, an ndearna sé soiléir dóibh gur ag caint ar 1997 a bhí an tAire, seachas ar 1996?  Ar ndóigh, tá seans maith ann go mbeidh cuid de na bóithre a bhí luaite ag na comhairlí contae déanta taca an ama seo arís agus tar éis an chaoi ar caitheadh leo i mbliana, níl aon chomhairle contae chun a dhul sa tseans san earrach go mbeidh nó nach mbeidh airgead ar fáil do bhóithre áise an bhliain seo chugainn.  Ní dóigh liomsa gur leithscéal é sin.  Níor fhreagair an tAire an dara ceist a chuir mé.  Cé mhéad iarratas atá faighte ag a Roinn ó thús na bliana seo ó mhuintir na Gaeltachta faoi Scéim na mBóithre Áise?  Más faoi oifigigh na gcomhairlí contae atá sé liosta a réiteach cén fáth a bhfuiltear ag scaipeadh foirmeacha iarratais ar phobal na Gaeltachta?  Cén túdar atá leis seo? \n Mr. M. Higgins  Ní dúirt mé go raibh cinneadh déanta go mbeadh comhairlí contae ag freastal ar aon iarratais do mo Roinnse.  Is féidir liom na figiúirí maidir leis na hiarratais a tháinig isteach a chur chugat agus déanfaidh mé sin.  Luafaidh mé na contaethe éagsúla ónar tháinig na hiarratais.  Maidir leis an teangmháil a bhí agam leis na comhairlí contae, ní raibh aon chinneadh tógtha ag an am, mar a luaigh me sa bhfreagra, nach mbeadh airgead ar fáil an bhliain seo.  Má tá an scéim chun teacht ar ais, caithfear é a reachtáil i gcomhpháirtíocht leis na húdaráis áitiúla agus na húdaráis eile ar bhealach. Tá sé tábhachtach go mbeadh aon scéim a bheadh ann rísoiléir ó thaobh na riachtanas agus próiseáladh na niarratas. \n Mr. Molloy  An nglacann an tAire leis go bhfuil géarghá le Scéim na mBóithre Áise a bheith ar fáil do mhuintir na Gaeltachta ionas go mbeidh seans éigin acu a gcuid drochbhóithre a dheisiú go tapa?  Tuigeann an tAire go raibh mé ag gearán faoin seanscéim agus go raibh gá lena leasú.  Ach seachas é a leasú, is éard a rinne an tAire ná an  scéim a chur ar ceal ar fad.  Chuir sé sin ionadh ar gach éinne agus glacann an tAire leis go ndúirt sé sa Dáil agus in áiteanna eile go raibh sé chun an cás a athbhreithniú.  Bhí an Teachta Ó Cuív agus mé féin ag iarraidh fáil amach uaidh cad é todhchaí na scéime seo.  An bhfuil sé i gceist é a athbhunú i mbliana mar d'fhéadfaí an chiall sin a ghlacadh ón méid a bhí le rá ag an Aire?  An bhfuil sé ag rá go cinnte go mbeidh sé ann an bhliain seo chugainn?  Agus an gcuirfidh sé in iúl don Teach go speisialta cad iad na rialacha nua a bheidh i bhfeidhm ionas go mbeidh chuile dhuine in ann a fheiceáil conas mar a roghnaigh an Roinn iarratas amháin thar iarratas eile? \n Mr. M. Higgins  An rud a tharla ná go ndúirt mé sa Teach go ndéanfainn athbhreithniú ar an scéal i lár na bliana féachaint an raibh sábháil ann in áiteacha eile a fhéadfainn caitheamh ar scéim chuí.  Glacaim leis go bhfuil riachtanais ann ach caithfidh mise mar Aire na riachtanais sin a chur i gcomhthéacs riachtanais eile agus chomh maith leis sin i gcomhthéacs na straitéise ó thaobh caiteachais phoiblí de.  An deacracht a bhíonn agam go minic ná ar tráthnóna mar seo bíonn na Teachtaí ag iarraidh orm an tam go léir airgead a chaitheamh.  Bíonn siad sa tarna binse uaireanta eile ag éileamh ciorraithe ón rialtas ó thaobh caiteachais phoiblí dhe.  Caithfidh siadsan a naigne a dhéanamh suas maidir le straitéis caiteachais phoiblí agus a bheith ionraic faoi.  Ná bídís ag caint go dátheangach ar bhealach speisialta.  An mbeidh an scéim ann i 1997? Táim ag obair ar scéim agus beidh mé ag iarraidh airgid di.  Tiocfaidh an freagra i gcomhthéacs cúrsaí airgeadais na tíre seo agus ar ndóigh roimhe sin déanfar ionsaí fíochmhar eile orainn ag rá go bhfuilimid ag caitheamh i bhfad níos mó airgid ná mar ba chóir. \n Mr. Molloy  Chuir freagra an Aire ionadh orm: é ag caitheamh an cheist seo isteach i lár cheist mhór caiteachais an Stáit.  Caithfidh an tAire a admháil  nach bhfuil i gceist anseo ach pingineacha.  Suim anbheag airgid a cuireadh ar fáil anuraidh agus an bhliain roimhe sin.  Ní aon dáinséar é do chaiteachas an Stáit an scéim seo a ligean ar aghaidh; tá sé seafóideach a bheith ag iarraidh a chur in iúl gurb ea.  Iarraim ar an Aire a chosa ar a chur ar an talamh agus a aghaidh a thabhairt ar fhadhbanna mhuintir na Gaeltachta agus teacht i gcabhair orthu tríd an scéim seo a chur ar ais sna meastacháin i mbliana agus le haghaidh an bhliain seo chugainn. \n Mr. M. Higgins  Cuirfidh mé moladh an Teachta O Maoildhia ar bharr liosta na neisceachtaí.  £253,000 a bhí i gceist. Aontaím leis nach suim mhór i gcomhthéacs chaiteachas iomlán an Stáit é ach mar a léireoidh a cheannaire féin dó, tagann na pingineacha agus na mílte go léir le chéile.  Rinne mé mo dhícheall airgead a chur ar fáil do scéim don bhliain seo ach ní féidir liom aon gheallúint a thabhairt ag an pointe seo mar níl na cainteanna thart. \n Éamon Ó Cuív  Tá sé soiléir cá bhfuil croí an Aire i dtaobh na ceiste seo.  Bhí sé in ann airgead as cuimse a fháil don taobh Ealaíon agus Cultúir den Roinn agus chuile mhír Ghaeltachta, gearrtar siar air, caitear i leataobh é mar is cosúil gur cuma an féidir le muintir na Gaeltachta dul ag a gcuid tithe nó nach féidir.  Céard í an uair dheireannach a thaisteal an tAire bóithre Chonamara ina charr fhéin?  An dtuigeann sé cé chomh dona agus chomh práinneach agus atá rudaí maidir le bóithre Chonamara? \n Mr. M. Higgins  Tá taithí agamsa ar bhóithre Chonamara agus bhí i bhfad sular tháinig an Teachta Ó Cuív anuas ó Bhaile Átha Cliath go Conamara.  Agus beidh mé ann nuair a bheidh sé imithe ar ais chuig a phréamacha, is cuma cá bhfuil siad.  Tá sé de nós ag an Teachta Ó Cuív startha a chur le chéile agus ligint air go bhfuil bunús leo, go bhfuil cúrsaí Gaeltachta imithe síos.  An chaoi mar shampla ina roinneann an Teachta an  straitéis seo, cuireann sé airgead do Theilifís na Gaeilge isteach le craolachán agus tógann sé airgead a bhí ann d'Údarás na Gaeltachta an bhliain seo caite agus deireann sé, dá bharr sin tá caiteachas Gaeltachta inithe síos go mór.  An uair dheiridh nuair a bhí mé ag freagairt ceisteanna breise ar ábhair mar seo thug an Teachta Ó Cuív dúshlán dom eolas a chur ar fáil a léireodh gur chuir a chomhleacaithe, an Teachta Bertie Ahern, ciorraithe i gcrích sna sé seachtainí nuair a bhí mise as an Aireacht.  Scríobh mé ar ais chuige agus thug mé an teolas sin dó agus is fiú dó é a léamh. ",

Chuir sé sin ionadh ar gach éinne agus glacann an tAire leis go ndúirt sé sa Dáil agus in áiteanna eile go raibh sé chun an cás a athbhreithniú.  Bhí an Teachta Ó Cuív agus mé féin ag iarraidh fáil amach uaidh cad é todhchaí na scéime seo.  An bhfuil sé i gceist é a athbhunú i mbliana mar d'fhéadfaí an chiall sin a ghlacadh ón méid a bhí le rá ag an Aire?  An bhfuil sé ag rá go cinnte go mbeidh sé ann an bhliain seo chugainn?  Agus an gcuirfidh sé in iúl don Teach go speisialta cad iad na rialacha nua a bheidh i bhfeidhm ionas go mbeidh chuile dhuine in ann a fheiceáil conas mar a roghnaigh an Roinn iarratas amháin thar iarratas eile? \n Mr. M. Higgins  An rud a tharla ná go ndúirt mé sa Teach go ndéanfainn athbhreithniú ar an scéal i lár na bliana féachaint an raibh sábháil ann in áiteacha eile a fhéadfainn caitheamh ar scéim chuí.  Glacaim leis go bhfuil riachtanais ann ach caithfidh mise mar Aire na riachtanais sin a chur i gcomhthéacs riachtanais eile agus chomh maith leis sin i gcomhthéacs na straitéise ó thaobh caiteachais phoiblí de.  An deacracht a bhíonn agam go minic ná ar tráthnóna mar seo bíonn na Teachtaí ag iarraidh orm an tam go léir airgead a chaitheamh.  Bíonn siad sa tarna binse uaireanta eile ag éileamh ciorraithe ón rialtas ó thaobh caiteachais phoiblí dhe.  Caithfidh siadsan a naigne a dhéanamh suas maidir le straitéis caiteachais phoiblí agus a bheith ionraic faoi.  Ná bídís ag caint go dátheangach ar bhealach speisialta.  An mbeidh an scéim ann i 1997? Táim ag obair ar scéim agus beidh mé ag iarraidh airgid di.  Tiocfaidh an freagra i gcomhthéacs cúrsaí airgeadais na tíre seo agus ar ndóigh roimhe sin déanfar ionsaí fíochmhar eile orainn ag rá go bhfuilimid ag caitheamh i bhfad níos mó airgid ná mar ba chóir. \n Mr. Molloy  Chuir freagra an Aire ionadh orm: é ag caitheamh an cheist seo isteach i lár cheist mhór caiteachais an Stáit.  Caithfidh an tAire a admháil  nach bhfuil i gceist anseo ach pingineacha.  Suim anbheag airgid a cuireadh ar fáil anuraidh agus an bhliain roimhe sin.  Ní aon dáinséar é do chaiteachas an Stáit an scéim seo a ligean ar aghaidh; tá sé seafóideach a bheith ag iarraidh a chur in iúl gurb ea.  Iarraim ar an Aire a chosa ar a chur ar an talamh agus a aghaidh a thabhairt ar fhadhbanna mhuintir na Gaeltachta agus teacht i gcabhair orthu tríd an scéim seo a chur ar ais sna meastacháin i mbliana agus le haghaidh an bhliain seo chugainn. \n Mr. M. Higgins  Cuirfidh mé moladh an Teachta O Maoildhia ar bharr liosta na neisceachtaí.  £253,000 a bhí i gceist. Aontaím leis nach suim mhór i gcomhthéacs chaiteachas iomlán an Stáit é ach mar a léireoidh a cheannaire féin dó, tagann na pingineacha agus na mílte go léir le chéile.  Rinne mé mo dhícheall airgead a chur ar fáil do scéim don bhliain seo ach ní féidir liom aon gheallúint a thabhairt ag an pointe seo mar níl na cainteanna thart. \n Éamon Ó Cuív  Tá sé soiléir cá bhfuil croí an Aire i dtaobh na ceiste seo.  Bhí sé in ann airgead as cuimse a fháil don taobh Ealaíon agus Cultúir den Roinn agus chuile mhír Ghaeltachta, gearrtar siar air, caitear i leataobh é mar is cosúil gur cuma an féidir le muintir na Gaeltachta dul ag a gcuid tithe nó nach féidir.  Céard í an uair dheireannach a thaisteal an tAire bóithre Chonamara ina charr fhéin?  An dtuigeann sé cé chomh dona agus chomh práinneach agus atá rudaí maidir le bóithre Chonamara? \n Mr. M. Higgins  Tá taithí agamsa ar bhóithre Chonamara agus bhí i bhfad sular tháinig an Teachta Ó Cuív anuas ó Bhaile Átha Cliath go Conamara.  Agus beidh mé ann nuair a bheidh sé imithe ar ais chuig a phréamacha, is cuma cá bhfuil siad.  Tá sé de nós ag an Teachta Ó Cuív startha a chur le chéile agus ligint air go bhfuil bunús leo, go bhfuil cúrsaí Gaeltachta imithe síos.  An chaoi mar shampla ina roinneann an Teachta an  straitéis seo, cuireann sé airgead do Theilifís na Gaeilge isteach le craolachán agus tógann sé airgead a bhí ann d'Údarás na Gaeltachta an bhliain seo caite agus deireann sé, dá bharr sin tá caiteachas Gaeltachta inithe síos go mór.  An uair dheiridh nuair a bhí mé ag freagairt ceisteanna breise ar ábhair mar seo thug an Teachta Ó Cuív dúshlán dom eolas a chur ar fáil a léireodh gur chuir a chomhleacaithe, an Teachta Bertie Ahern, ciorraithe i gcrích sna sé seachtainí nuair a bhí mise as an Aireacht.  Scríobh mé ar ais chuige agus thug mé an teolas sin dó agus is fiú dó é a léamh. ",

        "questionNumber": 23,
        "answerText": " Mr. Quinn  I propose to take Questions Nos. 43, 44 and 61 together.  Officials of my Department were made aware, for the first time, of the preliminary results of the CSO study into the growing gap between the estimated level of unemployment as measured by the Labour Force Survey and the number of persons on the live register at an interdepartmental meeting which commenced at 4 p.m. on 11 September 1996.  Arising from that meeting, a number of substantive issues had to be pursued between the CSO and the Department of Social Welfare before the report could be finalised. Following the necessary clarifications, the study was published on 18 September 1996.  The Government also considered the CSO study on 18 September 1996 and subsequently announced a series of initiatives designed to ensure that only those who are genuinely eligible receive unemployment payments.  These measures represent an enhanced programme of systematic controls targeted on areas of concern highlighted by the study, namely, working while signing, accurate addresses and availability for work.  It is the Government's intention  that the existing close liaison and co-operation between the various agencies which have a role to play in combating fraud and abuse will be strengthened further.  I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners there is already a high degree of co-operation, including exchange of information, between Revenue and the Department of Social Welfare in combating social welfare fraud. This co-operation includes the use of common indentifier numbers, the regular exchange of information about income, employments and self-employments and the operation of the joint investigation units throughout the country.  The Revenue Commissioners indicated they will be prepared to co-operate as appropriate in any new measures the Department of Social Welfare may take in relation to fraud.  Deputies can be assured of the Government's determination to ensure the relevant agencies pool and apply their expertise to identify and confront those who are simultaneously defrauding the taxpayer and doing such a disservice to those who are earnestly seeking work but are unable to find it.  The financial implications for the Exchequer of the Government decisions arising from the results of the CSO study are not yet clear.  A range of assumptions have to be made in interpreting the report in this respect.  Any figure to be factored into the budgetary arithmetic must be as firmly based as possible.  My Department is in contact with the Department of Social Welfare to finalise estimates of the savings to be achieved.  I have been asked if I will commit the savings that emerge to a reduction in income tax.  It is the Government's policy to continue, within responsible budgetary parameters, to lower the tax and PRSI burden on earned income, focusing assistance especially towards those on lower incomes.  Significant improvements were made in this regard in the last two budgets.  There are, of course, different views as to the form further reductions in taxation should  take, and the groups towards whom relief should be targeted.  I hope to consolidate and build upon the type of measures introduced in the last two years in the 1997 budget.  However, final decisions on the precise composition of the income tax package can only be taken in the context of the overall budgetary package close to budget time. \n Mr. McCreevy  Can I take it the Minister now agrees with a point I made on many occasions, that there is no reason the Department of Social Welfare with some political will and guidance should not be able to reconcile the figures between the labour force survey and the live register?  It is not impossible to so do.  Would the Minister now agree it is possible to reconcile those conflicting figures given the level of technology available to the Department of Social Welfare?  As a former Minister for Social Welfare I assure the Minister there is no good reason this cannot be done, whatever officials in the Department of Finance are being told.  It can and should be done. \n Mr. Quinn  I do not agree with the fundamental conclusion to which the Deputy has come.  If he is inferring that officials from the Department of Social Welfare have consistently misled officials in the Department of Finance that is a very serious allegation.  If he is saying, on the other hand, that the Department of Social Welfare has the ability to independently verify the accuracy of its records outside the CSO or the labour force survey, that is not the information we have.  I have heard Deputy McCreevy make that point on numerous occasions on the floor of this House in unscripted remarks.  However, that is not my understanding of the situation having made inquiries subsequent to the Deputy's assertions.  If the Deputy has specific information to the effect that the Department of Social Welfare has the independent capability to verify accuracy outside the CSO on the mismatch between the labour force  survey and the live register, which is of the order of approximately 90,000.  I invite him to present it.  I do not have that information.  When I sought it I was told it is not available. \n Mr. M. McDowell  Would the Minister agree it was unfortunate, to say the least, that the Select Committee on Finance and General Affairs, which considered this matter on the day after new information on this matter became available to the Department of Finance and which questioned the Secretary of the Department of Finance with some degree of vigour and intensity over a long period of time, was left completely in the dark as to even the existence of a survey of this kind which would have explained in large measure the divergence between the labour force survey and the live register?  Would the Minister also agree it was especially incumbent on his Department to provide to the Oireachtas Committee dealing with the matter, an indication at the first available opportunity, that such a study had been carried out and that the preliminary and as yet unfinalised indications were that the estimates of the Department of Social Welfare about the extent of fraud — that it was less than half of one per cent — were wildly wrong?  Does the Minister agree it would have been preferable to give the committee a clear indication of the reality rather than allowing it pursue the line Deputy McCreevy has just pursued about the difficulties of liaison between the two Departments? \n Mr. Quinn  It was not unfortunate that the coincidence of the report being delivered to my Department on Wednesday at 4 p.m. in a draft form was the day before the Secretary of my Department met the committee of which both Deputies opposite and others are members.  I was not briefed until 3 p.m. on the Thursday afternoon as to the full contents of the initial report.  I had been told late on Wednesday afternoon that a report had  come in, that it was a preliminary report, that my officials were checking figures as to their accuracy and that they intended to brief me comprehensively. They subsequently did so at 3 p.m. on Thursday afternoon.  The Secretary of the Department as is normal practice in all Departments, sent me a copy of the opening statement he intended to give to the committee.  I was aware of the contents of that statement.  I turned on my monitor to see some of the questions and answers on the matter which Deputy McDowell has just described. As far as I am concerned the Secretary of the Department of Finance behaved absolutely properly having regard to the quality and status of the information he possessed at that time.  If he had gone beyond the point to which he went, he would have been open to a charge of interpreting information whose veracity was still subject to confirmation.  We know in respect of those people who were working and drawing social welfare benefits at the same time that the figure was significantly reduced subsequent to 4 p.m. on that Wednesday.  If there is an inference in Deputy McDowell's question — I am not so sure that there is and if there is not I will immediately withdraw my remark — to the effect that the Secretary of the Department of Finance deliberately prevented information being made available to the committee which he knew was in the process of emerging and which is rightly the property of the Oireachtas.  I categorically refute it.  The information we got was of a preliminary nature.  The Secretary had prepared his remarks for the committee the day before.  The first time we got the information in the Department was at 4 p.m. on the Wednesday.  He addressed the committee that afternoon.  At the same time or some little time after, I was briefed by the officials for the first time.  Even at that stage, they looked for verification. If the thrust of Deputy McDowell's question is to suggest that the Secretary of the Department of Finance attempted to cover up or to prevent factual information becoming available to  the committee, I repudiate it categorically. \n An Leas-Cheann Comhairle  Time is all but exhausted and I would like to facilitate Deputies who tabled the remaining two priority questions.  I will have two very brief questions. \n Mr. M. McDowell  I have only asked one question. \n An Leas-Cheann Comhairle  The Deputy knows we have 20 minutes for priority questions, and that time is exhausted. \n Mr. M. McDowell  There is not much point in having priority questions if Deputies can only ask one supplementary question. \n An Leas-Cheann Comhairle  That is for another forum, as the Deputy knows. \n Mr. M. McDowell  I am not implying that the Secretary of the Department of Finance attempted to mislead the committee. Having reconsidered what was said, it became apparent to me that he was having difficulty answering the questions that Deputies McCreevy, Cullen and I put to him, bearing in mind what he must have known at the time. The decision not to reveal to the committee the existence of such a study, the substance of which would have an outcome on the questions which were being put to him, and also that the two Departments had co-operated to the point of establishing such a study and receiving a report which they were considering on the issue, was a matter of not keeping adequate faith with Members of the Oireachtas who not only are entitled not to be told untruths — I accept no untruths were told — but to be told truthfully the factual position. We spent an hour and a half on that day dealing with this matter, most of which time was devoted to this subject, but the  most fundamental piece of information was not revealed to us. \n Mr. Quinn  Deputy McDowell has repeatedly used the word \"truthfully\". The Secretary of the Department of Finance was aware of a study that had been carried out, the contents of which had yet to be verified.  He was not in a position to speculate as to its contents nor to reveal the fact that such a study had been carried out. \n Mr. M. McDowell  Why not? \n Mr. Quinn  For the simple reason that until such time as a definitive result from that study was available, much negative speculation could have been bandied about which would not have been helpful.  People would have asked why we were carrying out studies and did not just give the results.  In the circumstances and having regard to events surrounding the occasion, the Secretary of the Department of Finance carried out his responsibilities impeccably. \n Mr. McCreevy  I did most of the questioning of the Secretary of the Department of Finance on this topic which, as the Minister is aware, is one of my favourite hobby horses.  I have no problem in agreeing the line taken by the Secretary of the Department of Finance since he did not know the outcome of the report but I take on board Deputy McDowell's view that we were not aware that such a report was in the course of preparation.  In light of the relevance of events of November-December 1994, I am delighted to hear the Minister for Finance, Deputy Quinn, make the point very clearly that it would not have been correct for the Secretary of the Department of Finance to even hint at the existence of a report until there was, to quote the Minister, a definitive report.  I am sure the Minister will convey that message to all his Labour Party colleagues, particularly those in Government. \n Mr. Quinn  I note what the Deputy has said. ",

If there is an inference in Deputy McDowell's question — I am not so sure that there is and if there is not I will immediately withdraw my remark — to the effect that the Secretary of the Department of Finance deliberately prevented information being made available to the committee which he knew was in the process of emerging and which is rightly the property of the Oireachtas.  I categorically refute it.  The information we got was of a preliminary nature.  The Secretary had prepared his remarks for the committee the day before.  The first time we got the information in the Department was at 4 p.m. on the Wednesday.  He addressed the committee that afternoon.  At the same time or some little time after, I was briefed by the officials for the first time.  Even at that stage, they looked for verification. If the thrust of Deputy McDowell's question is to suggest that the Secretary of the Department of Finance attempted to cover up or to prevent factual information becoming available to  the committee, I repudiate it categorically. \n An Leas-Cheann Comhairle  Time is all but exhausted and I would like to facilitate Deputies who tabled the remaining two priority questions.  I will have two very brief questions. \n Mr. M. McDowell  I have only asked one question. \n An Leas-Cheann Comhairle  The Deputy knows we have 20 minutes for priority questions, and that time is exhausted. \n Mr. M. McDowell  There is not much point in having priority questions if Deputies can only ask one supplementary question. \n An Leas-Cheann Comhairle  That is for another forum, as the Deputy knows. \n Mr. M. McDowell  I am not implying that the Secretary of the Department of Finance attempted to mislead the committee. Having reconsidered what was said, it became apparent to me that he was having difficulty answering the questions that Deputies McCreevy, Cullen and I put to him, bearing in mind what he must have known at the time. The decision not to reveal to the committee the existence of such a study, the substance of which would have an outcome on the questions which were being put to him, and also that the two Departments had co-operated to the point of establishing such a study and receiving a report which they were considering on the issue, was a matter of not keeping adequate faith with Members of the Oireachtas who not only are entitled not to be told untruths — I accept no untruths were told — but to be told truthfully the factual position. We spent an hour and a half on that day dealing with this matter, most of which time was devoted to this subject, but the  most fundamental piece of information was not revealed to us. \n Mr. Quinn  Deputy McDowell has repeatedly used the word \"truthfully\". The Secretary of the Department of Finance was aware of a study that had been carried out, the contents of which had yet to be verified.  He was not in a position to speculate as to its contents nor to reveal the fact that such a study had been carried out. \n Mr. M. McDowell  Why not? \n Mr. Quinn  For the simple reason that until such time as a definitive result from that study was available, much negative speculation could have been bandied about which would not have been helpful.  People would have asked why we were carrying out studies and did not just give the results.  In the circumstances and having regard to events surrounding the occasion, the Secretary of the Department of Finance carried out his responsibilities impeccably. \n Mr. McCreevy  I did most of the questioning of the Secretary of the Department of Finance on this topic which, as the Minister is aware, is one of my favourite hobby horses.  I have no problem in agreeing the line taken by the Secretary of the Department of Finance since he did not know the outcome of the report but I take on board Deputy McDowell's view that we were not aware that such a report was in the course of preparation.  In light of the relevance of events of November-December 1994, I am delighted to hear the Minister for Finance, Deputy Quinn, make the point very clearly that it would not have been correct for the Secretary of the Department of Finance to even hint at the existence of a report until there was, to quote the Minister, a definitive report.  I am sure the Minister will convey that message to all his Labour Party colleagues, particularly those in Government. \n Mr. Quinn  I note what the Deputy has said. ",

        "answerText": " Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Spring)  I propose to take Questions Nos. 1, 8, 11, 19, 21, 23, 28, 29, 32, 34, 36, 37, 39, 40, 46, 47 and 49 together.  As Deputies will be aware, the ground rules oblige participants to maintain confidentiality on all aspects of the negotiations except where they may, from time to time, agree to publicity.  It would not, therefore, be appropriate for me to describe in detail the progress of the negotiations.  As regards briefing Opposition parties during the negotiations, I refer Deputies to my reply of 30 May to a previous question on this matter, and I would again invite the relevant spokespersons to discuss the matter with me.  I am available to discuss this at any time with the Opposition spokespersons.  I can, however, inform the House that discussion to date has centred on the adoption of agreed procedural rules. While the Government would have hoped that the negotiations could have proceeded more rapidly to matters of substance, nonetheless it is perhaps understandable that the early stages of negotiations involving so many parties, with such different viewpoints, would make relatively slow headway.  I am hopeful that agreement on the rules of procedure will soon be reached and that it will be possible to move into the substantive negotiations which we all wish to see without undue delay.  On 6 June, the two Governments invited a group consisting of Senator  George Mitchell, General John de Chastelain and Mr. Harri Holkeri to play a role in chairing various aspects of the negotiations which require independent chairmanship.  They invited the chairman of the group, Senator Mitchell, to chair the plenary sessions of the negotiations, and also invited General de Chastelain to chair the Strand II negotiations and the business committee, and Mr. Holkeri to act as alternate chairman in any of the chairmanship roles.  On Wednesday, 12 June the Opening Plenary formally appointed Senator Mitchell, General de Chastelain and Mr. Holkeri to these chairmanships. I, and other members of the Government negotiating team — like each of the other negotiating teams — have, of course, been in intensive and ongoing contact with Senator Mitchell and his colleagues since the negotiations began. We are very fortunate to have secured the services of three such distinguished personalities, whose skills and dedication have already been amply demonstrated.  Following the formal opening of the negotiations on 10 June by the Taoiseach and the British Prime Minister, the Government has been represented at political level by a team drawn from myself, the Minister for Justice, the Minister for Social Welfare, the Minister for Equality and Law Reform, Minister of State, Deputy Coveney and the Attorney General.  This allows us the flexibility to be represented in a variety of formations, depending on the subject matter and the particular stage reached in discussion.  A list setting out the details of attendance on particular days is being circulated in the Official Report.  Officials have also been present throughout.  The ground rules establish the basic parameters for the Strand II negotiations. They will cover relationships within the island of Ireland and will involve the British and Irish Governments and the political parties participating in the negotiations.  As I indicated earlier, formal meetings in Strand  II will be chaired by General de Chastelain. Negotiations will take place on the basis of an agreed agenda and in appropriate formations as agreed by the participants. On 6 June the two Governments put forward a draft agenda for Strand II, but this has yet to be considered by the other participants in the negotiations.  The ground rules also state that Strand II negotiations will take place in Belfast, Dublin and London, at times agreed by the business committee.  No precise arrangements have yet been made.  As regards the venues for the other elements of the negotiations, meetings in Strand I will take place at Castle Buildings, Belfast; the two Governments will determine where Strand III meetings will take place; and the business committee shall determine the venue of its meetings.  As I stated when last answering questions in this House, on 30 May: \"the Government's approach will be based on the Framework Document.  While it is intended as an aid to negotiations and not as a rigid blueprint to be imposed, both Governments have stated that it sets out a realistic, balanced and achievable framework for agreement\".  The Taoiseach reiterated the commitment of the Government to the Framework Document in his address at the opening of the negotiations on 10 June.  Ultimately, of course, it is for the participants themselves to determine the outcome of the negotiations.  As regards treatment of the decommissioning issue, the two Governments maintain their joint commitment, originally stated in the communiqué of 28 February, that as one of a number of confidence-building measures all participants would need to address, at the beginning of the discussions, the International Body's proposals on decommissioning. In the documents, published on 6 June, the two Governments also confirmed their commitment to all aspects of the report of the International Body, including our support for the compromise approach to decommissioning set out in paragraphs 34 and  35.  Both Governments agree with the International Body that this approach provides the opportunity to move forward, and that it is on the basis of working constructively to implement this and all other aspects of the report that the negotiations should be advanced.  We confirmed we would work with all the participants to implement all aspects of the report.  The question of how to deal with decommissioning in the negotiations has not yet been agreed, and indeed has not so far been the subject of serious discussion in the negotiations.  The conditions for participation in the negotiations remain as set out in the ground rules.  All political parties with an electoral mandate deriving from the 30 May elections in Northern Ireland which establish a commitment to exclusively peaceful methods and have shown that they abide by the democratic process are entitled to be involved.  Sinn Féin's participation in the negotiations, and the resumption of ministerial dialogue with them, requires the unequivocal restoration of the ceasefire of August 1994.  I continue to urge the Sinn Féin leadership to immediately seek such a restoration.  That is the only basis on which the 15 per cent of the Northern Ireland electorate which voted for them — after they had campaigned on the slogan \"Vote for Peace\"— can be directly represented at the negotiations. The Government wants to see this happen as soon as possible.  Nevertheless, it is clear that the recent IRA atrocities in Adare, Manchester and Osnabruck, which I once again condemn in the strongest possible terms, with the discovery by the Garda of the Clonaslee bomb factory, have added greatly to the anger and doubts of the public about the intentions of the republican movement.  It will be for the republican movement to find ways of overcoming these extra obstacles and of demonstrating the credibility of any future statement that the ceasefire has been restored.  The Government continues to be open to communication with Sinn Féin  at official level.  In the period leading up to 10 June, we used official channels to convey to Sinn Féin our conviction that the arrangements being put in place for the negotiations were fair and balanced, and our determination to ensure that the negotiations would be serious and comprehensive.  While we will continue to keep channels of communication open as appropriate, I must make clear the view of the Government that the restoration of the IRA ceasefire is not a matter for negotiation, but rather a matter where the most urgent action is required by the leaders of the republican movement themselves.  I repeat the assurances given by the Government to the House that all possible action will be taken to prevent further IRA outrages, and the resources of the State fully deployed in pursuing the perpetrators of crime, from whatever quarter they come.  Ministerial Attendance At Multi-Party Negotiations   Week 1 (10-12 June)   Tánaiste (10-12 June)  Minister for Justice (10-12 June)  Minister for Social Welfare (10-12 June)  Minister for Equality and Law Reform (10-11 June)  Attorney General (10-11 June)   Week 2 (17-19 June)   Tánaiste (19 June)  Minister for Justice (19 June)  Minister for Social Welfare (19 June)  Minister for Equality and Law Reform (19 June)  Minister of State Coveney (19 June)  Attorney General (17-19 June)   Week 3 (24-27 June)   Minister for Equality and Law Reform (24-25 June)  Minister of State Coveney (24-27 June)  Attorney General (24-25 June)   Week 4 (1-4 July)   Minister of State Coveney (1-4 July). \n Mr. R. Burke  That is a very comprehensive reply to the series of questions. On the question of the ceasefire, does the Tánaiste see grounds for optimism in relation to a renewed IRA ceasefire  and is he aware of any grounds for the slightly more optimistic views expressed in statements yesterday by the Northern Ireland Secretary of State and the British Prime Minister?  Does he see anything new in the IRA interview published in An Phoblacht today? \n Mr. Spring  If I were to comment on the lines requested by the Deputy, it would be pure speculation.  I will be honest and frank in my replies to the Deputy in that respect.  Earlier this year, leading up to 10 June, the time we completed our negotiations with the British Government, we believed that everything that was required was in place for the cessation of violence to be restored. Unfortunately, since then those hopes have been dashed because of what has happened in Adare, Manchester and, of course, the attack on the Continent.  Against that background it is fair to acknowledge that there are people who want to bring Sinn Féin into the democratic process, into talks and negotiations. I hope those people will be successful because we want them at those talks.  The public has difficulty understanding how there are people saying they want peace talks, the peace talks were arranged for 10 June on the clear understanding that we wanted Sinn Féin to be at them but now the atrocities are continuing.  The message from the Government is very clear and I know it is one with which Deputy Burke agrees in that there will be no negotiations or discussions until there is a clear restoration of the ceasefire.  We urge it to call a ceasefire as soon as possible. \n Mr. R. Burke  It is my view that there cannot and should not be any talks until the ceasefire is restored.  What he is saying, in effect, is that he has no information to confirm the assessment of the situation by the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland who engaged in speculation yesterday that there is hope for a ceasefire.  I hope from everybody's point of view that it is accurate.  The Minister will be aware of the disappointment many people feel in relation to the lack of progress in the procedural wrangles at the talks which began on 10 June in Stormont.  Will he comment on the disappointment expressed by the deputy leader of the SDLP, Mr. Seamus Mallon, at the lack of action and resolve of the two Governments and their failure to take a lead role in the process?  Will he accept that these procedural issues need to be settled as rapidly as possible and that signs of progress would have a most positive effect on the chances for a renewed ceasefire? \n Mr. Spring  Both Governments want to make progress.  Some parties are more anxious than others to do so.  I do not think anybody was particularly surprised that there were difficulties at the launch of the talks.  There are parties present with widely diverging views, some of whom have never sat down with one another in the past in formal negotiations.  We want to create space to overcome these difficulties.  We had hoped that progress would have been made by now.  We still hope that progress can be achieved before the summer recess.  In relation to the comments made by Mr. Seamus Mallon, in close co-operation with the British Government, the Government is active in trying to conclude the procedural phase of the negotiations as quickly as possible.  We are also working closely with the other participants, not least, in terms of meetings, the SDLP.  We will continue to do everything possible, in close co-operation with the British Government, to move the process forward.  In order to expedite matters we have to get agreement among the participants. We have to be careful in our approach because from time to time we are accused, I believe unfairly, of imposing propositions and solutions on various parties.  We will try to progress matters in a careful and sensitive way.  We are working to obtain the agreement of the parties sitting at the table with us. \n An Ceann Comhairle  Let us not forget the time factor in dealing with priority questions.  We are dwelling overlong on this question. \n Mr. R. Burke  I appreciate your concern but the Minister covered a considerable amount of ground, including the issue of decommissioning, the subject matter of Question No. 8 in the name of Deputy O'Donnell.  I ask you to bear with me.  The ground rules for the talks were set out by the two Governments.  It is essential that they take a lead role.  It will be easier for them to bring the parties with them if there is consistency in the membership of the negotiating teams, particularly at a high level.  The Government should do everything possible to allay the concerns of Mr. Seamus Mallon who was a participant in the 1992 talks and is not unfamiliar with the way the talks process should be moved forward.  The two Governments have a leading role to play, not a passive one. That has not been done so far. \n Mr. Spring  I do not accept what the Deputy said.  The Government is right to consider that it is playing a leading role.  Ultimate responsibility rests with the two Governments.  That is the basis upon which we will continue to work in the talks.  I understand the frustration of politicians like Mr. Seamus Mallon who wants to get on with serious and meaningful negotiations.  We will do everything in our power to ensure we can get to that stage as quickly as possible. \n Mr. R. Burke  How will the decommissioning question be dealt with in the absence of Sinn Féin?  Is it the Government's position that once there is a ceasefire and the six Mitchell principles are accepted and observed no party can be excluded from the talks?  Does Sinn Féin expect to be allowed in once the ceasefire is restored on the grounds that  it accepts the Mitchell principles, despite the horrendous incidents in Adare, Manchester and Osnabruck? \n Mr. Spring  As I made clear on the last occasion I answered questions in the House, we want Sinn Féin at the table. The difficulties in relation to its participation have been exacerbated because of the atrocities committed since.  Notwithstanding this, it received a 17 per cent mandate in the Northern Ireland elections.  We strongly believe that a great deal of this is accounted for by people who want peace and Sinn Féin to participate in negotiations.  We will do everything we can in that respect.  So far as the Government is concerned, the Mitchell report governs the decommissioning issue.  It would be unwise to try to unscramble the Mitchell report in its totality.  Paragraphs 34 and 35 in particular offer the best and perhaps only way of dealing with this difficult question, if we are to be successful. ",

Ministerial Attendance At Multi-Party Negotiations   Week 1 (10-12 June)   Tánaiste (10-12 June)  Minister for Justice (10-12 June)  Minister for Social Welfare (10-12 June)  Minister for Equality and Law Reform (10-11 June)  Attorney General (10-11 June)   Week 2 (17-19 June)   Tánaiste (19 June)  Minister for Justice (19 June)  Minister for Social Welfare (19 June)  Minister for Equality and Law Reform (19 June)  Minister of State Coveney (19 June)  Attorney General (17-19 June)   Week 3 (24-27 June)   Minister for Equality and Law Reform (24-25 June)  Minister of State Coveney (24-27 June)  Attorney General (24-25 June)   Week 4 (1-4 July)   Minister of State Coveney (1-4 July). \n Mr. R. Burke  That is a very comprehensive reply to the series of questions. On the question of the ceasefire, does the Tánaiste see grounds for optimism in relation to a renewed IRA ceasefire  and is he aware of any grounds for the slightly more optimistic views expressed in statements yesterday by the Northern Ireland Secretary of State and the British Prime Minister?  Does he see anything new in the IRA interview published in An Phoblacht today? \n Mr. Spring  If I were to comment on the lines requested by the Deputy, it would be pure speculation.  I will be honest and frank in my replies to the Deputy in that respect.  Earlier this year, leading up to 10 June, the time we completed our negotiations with the British Government, we believed that everything that was required was in place for the cessation of violence to be restored. Unfortunately, since then those hopes have been dashed because of what has happened in Adare, Manchester and, of course, the attack on the Continent.  Against that background it is fair to acknowledge that there are people who want to bring Sinn Féin into the democratic process, into talks and negotiations. I hope those people will be successful because we want them at those talks.  The public has difficulty understanding how there are people saying they want peace talks, the peace talks were arranged for 10 June on the clear understanding that we wanted Sinn Féin to be at them but now the atrocities are continuing.  The message from the Government is very clear and I know it is one with which Deputy Burke agrees in that there will be no negotiations or discussions until there is a clear restoration of the ceasefire.  We urge it to call a ceasefire as soon as possible. \n Mr. R. Burke  It is my view that there cannot and should not be any talks until the ceasefire is restored.  What he is saying, in effect, is that he has no information to confirm the assessment of the situation by the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland who engaged in speculation yesterday that there is hope for a ceasefire.  I hope from everybody's point of view that it is accurate.  The Minister will be aware of the disappointment many people feel in relation to the lack of progress in the procedural wrangles at the talks which began on 10 June in Stormont.  Will he comment on the disappointment expressed by the deputy leader of the SDLP, Mr. Seamus Mallon, at the lack of action and resolve of the two Governments and their failure to take a lead role in the process?  Will he accept that these procedural issues need to be settled as rapidly as possible and that signs of progress would have a most positive effect on the chances for a renewed ceasefire? \n Mr. Spring  Both Governments want to make progress.  Some parties are more anxious than others to do so.  I do not think anybody was particularly surprised that there were difficulties at the launch of the talks.  There are parties present with widely diverging views, some of whom have never sat down with one another in the past in formal negotiations.  We want to create space to overcome these difficulties.  We had hoped that progress would have been made by now.  We still hope that progress can be achieved before the summer recess.  In relation to the comments made by Mr. Seamus Mallon, in close co-operation with the British Government, the Government is active in trying to conclude the procedural phase of the negotiations as quickly as possible.  We are also working closely with the other participants, not least, in terms of meetings, the SDLP.  We will continue to do everything possible, in close co-operation with the British Government, to move the process forward.  In order to expedite matters we have to get agreement among the participants. We have to be careful in our approach because from time to time we are accused, I believe unfairly, of imposing propositions and solutions on various parties.  We will try to progress matters in a careful and sensitive way.  We are working to obtain the agreement of the parties sitting at the table with us. \n An Ceann Comhairle  Let us not forget the time factor in dealing with priority questions.  We are dwelling overlong on this question. \n Mr. R. Burke  I appreciate your concern but the Minister covered a considerable amount of ground, including the issue of decommissioning, the subject matter of Question No. 8 in the name of Deputy O'Donnell.  I ask you to bear with me.  The ground rules for the talks were set out by the two Governments.  It is essential that they take a lead role.  It will be easier for them to bring the parties with them if there is consistency in the membership of the negotiating teams, particularly at a high level.  The Government should do everything possible to allay the concerns of Mr. Seamus Mallon who was a participant in the 1992 talks and is not unfamiliar with the way the talks process should be moved forward.  The two Governments have a leading role to play, not a passive one. That has not been done so far. \n Mr. Spring  I do not accept what the Deputy said.  The Government is right to consider that it is playing a leading role.  Ultimate responsibility rests with the two Governments.  That is the basis upon which we will continue to work in the talks.  I understand the frustration of politicians like Mr. Seamus Mallon who wants to get on with serious and meaningful negotiations.  We will do everything in our power to ensure we can get to that stage as quickly as possible. \n Mr. R. Burke  How will the decommissioning question be dealt with in the absence of Sinn Féin?  Is it the Government's position that once there is a ceasefire and the six Mitchell principles are accepted and observed no party can be excluded from the talks?  Does Sinn Féin expect to be allowed in once the ceasefire is restored on the grounds that  it accepts the Mitchell principles, despite the horrendous incidents in Adare, Manchester and Osnabruck? \n Mr. Spring  As I made clear on the last occasion I answered questions in the House, we want Sinn Féin at the table. The difficulties in relation to its participation have been exacerbated because of the atrocities committed since.  Notwithstanding this, it received a 17 per cent mandate in the Northern Ireland elections.  We strongly believe that a great deal of this is accounted for by people who want peace and Sinn Féin to participate in negotiations.  We will do everything we can in that respect.  So far as the Government is concerned, the Mitchell report governs the decommissioning issue.  It would be unwise to try to unscramble the Mitchell report in its totality.  Paragraphs 34 and 35 in particular offer the best and perhaps only way of dealing with this difficult question, if we are to be successful. ",

        "answerText": " Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Spring)  I propose to take Questions Nos. 1, 8, 11, 19, 21, 23, 28, 29, 32, 34, 36, 37, 39, 40, 46, 47 and 49 together.  As Deputies will be aware, the ground rules oblige participants to maintain confidentiality on all aspects of the negotiations except where they may, from time to time, agree to publicity.  It would not, therefore, be appropriate for me to describe in detail the progress of the negotiations.  As regards briefing Opposition parties during the negotiations, I refer Deputies to my reply of 30 May to a previous question on this matter, and I would again invite the relevant spokespersons to discuss the matter with me.  I am available to discuss this at any time with the Opposition spokespersons.  I can, however, inform the House that discussion to date has centred on the adoption of agreed procedural rules. While the Government would have hoped that the negotiations could have proceeded more rapidly to matters of substance, nonetheless it is perhaps understandable that the early stages of negotiations involving so many parties, with such different viewpoints, would make relatively slow headway.  I am hopeful that agreement on the rules of procedure will soon be reached and that it will be possible to move into the substantive negotiations which we all wish to see without undue delay.  On 6 June, the two Governments invited a group consisting of Senator  George Mitchell, General John de Chastelain and Mr. Harri Holkeri to play a role in chairing various aspects of the negotiations which require independent chairmanship.  They invited the chairman of the group, Senator Mitchell, to chair the plenary sessions of the negotiations, and also invited General de Chastelain to chair the Strand II negotiations and the business committee, and Mr. Holkeri to act as alternate chairman in any of the chairmanship roles.  On Wednesday, 12 June the Opening Plenary formally appointed Senator Mitchell, General de Chastelain and Mr. Holkeri to these chairmanships. I, and other members of the Government negotiating team — like each of the other negotiating teams — have, of course, been in intensive and ongoing contact with Senator Mitchell and his colleagues since the negotiations began. We are very fortunate to have secured the services of three such distinguished personalities, whose skills and dedication have already been amply demonstrated.  Following the formal opening of the negotiations on 10 June by the Taoiseach and the British Prime Minister, the Government has been represented at political level by a team drawn from myself, the Minister for Justice, the Minister for Social Welfare, the Minister for Equality and Law Reform, Minister of State, Deputy Coveney and the Attorney General.  This allows us the flexibility to be represented in a variety of formations, depending on the subject matter and the particular stage reached in discussion.  A list setting out the details of attendance on particular days is being circulated in the Official Report.  Officials have also been present throughout.  The ground rules establish the basic parameters for the Strand II negotiations. They will cover relationships within the island of Ireland and will involve the British and Irish Governments and the political parties participating in the negotiations.  As I indicated earlier, formal meetings in Strand  II will be chaired by General de Chastelain. Negotiations will take place on the basis of an agreed agenda and in appropriate formations as agreed by the participants. On 6 June the two Governments put forward a draft agenda for Strand II, but this has yet to be considered by the other participants in the negotiations.  The ground rules also state that Strand II negotiations will take place in Belfast, Dublin and London, at times agreed by the business committee.  No precise arrangements have yet been made.  As regards the venues for the other elements of the negotiations, meetings in Strand I will take place at Castle Buildings, Belfast; the two Governments will determine where Strand III meetings will take place; and the business committee shall determine the venue of its meetings.  As I stated when last answering questions in this House, on 30 May: \"the Government's approach will be based on the Framework Document.  While it is intended as an aid to negotiations and not as a rigid blueprint to be imposed, both Governments have stated that it sets out a realistic, balanced and achievable framework for agreement\".  The Taoiseach reiterated the commitment of the Government to the Framework Document in his address at the opening of the negotiations on 10 June.  Ultimately, of course, it is for the participants themselves to determine the outcome of the negotiations.  As regards treatment of the decommissioning issue, the two Governments maintain their joint commitment, originally stated in the communiqué of 28 February, that as one of a number of confidence-building measures all participants would need to address, at the beginning of the discussions, the International Body's proposals on decommissioning. In the documents, published on 6 June, the two Governments also confirmed their commitment to all aspects of the report of the International Body, including our support for the compromise approach to decommissioning set out in paragraphs 34 and  35.  Both Governments agree with the International Body that this approach provides the opportunity to move forward, and that it is on the basis of working constructively to implement this and all other aspects of the report that the negotiations should be advanced.  We confirmed we would work with all the participants to implement all aspects of the report.  The question of how to deal with decommissioning in the negotiations has not yet been agreed, and indeed has not so far been the subject of serious discussion in the negotiations.  The conditions for participation in the negotiations remain as set out in the ground rules.  All political parties with an electoral mandate deriving from the 30 May elections in Northern Ireland which establish a commitment to exclusively peaceful methods and have shown that they abide by the democratic process are entitled to be involved.  Sinn Féin's participation in the negotiations, and the resumption of ministerial dialogue with them, requires the unequivocal restoration of the ceasefire of August 1994.  I continue to urge the Sinn Féin leadership to immediately seek such a restoration.  That is the only basis on which the 15 per cent of the Northern Ireland electorate which voted for them — after they had campaigned on the slogan \"Vote for Peace\"— can be directly represented at the negotiations. The Government wants to see this happen as soon as possible.  Nevertheless, it is clear that the recent IRA atrocities in Adare, Manchester and Osnabruck, which I once again condemn in the strongest possible terms, with the discovery by the Garda of the Clonaslee bomb factory, have added greatly to the anger and doubts of the public about the intentions of the republican movement.  It will be for the republican movement to find ways of overcoming these extra obstacles and of demonstrating the credibility of any future statement that the ceasefire has been restored.  The Government continues to be open to communication with Sinn Féin  at official level.  In the period leading up to 10 June, we used official channels to convey to Sinn Féin our conviction that the arrangements being put in place for the negotiations were fair and balanced, and our determination to ensure that the negotiations would be serious and comprehensive.  While we will continue to keep channels of communication open as appropriate, I must make clear the view of the Government that the restoration of the IRA ceasefire is not a matter for negotiation, but rather a matter where the most urgent action is required by the leaders of the republican movement themselves.  I repeat the assurances given by the Government to the House that all possible action will be taken to prevent further IRA outrages, and the resources of the State fully deployed in pursuing the perpetrators of crime, from whatever quarter they come.

        "answerText": " Minister for Health (Mr. Noonan,  Limerick East): I propose to take Questions Nos. 1, 19, 27, 32 and 35 together.  It is a matter for each person who has been diagnosed positive for hepatitis C antibodies or hepatitis C virus, as a result of receiving a blood transfusion or a blood product within the State, to decide whether to pursue his or her claim to the courts or to the Compensation Tribunal.  The making of a claim to the tribunal under the scheme does not involve a waiver of any right of action.  During the course of negotiations between my Department and interested groups in November 1995, it was agreed that the time within which a claimant must apply would be extended, from three to six months, as is now the case in the tribunal scheme.  In accordance with the tribunal scheme, claimants must apply within six months of the date on which they first become aware of the fact that they have been diagnosed positive for hepatitis C antibodies or hepatitis C virus or within six months of the date of the establishment of the tribunal, whichever date is the later.  In exceptional cases the tribunal may in its absolute discretion extend the time limit and shall do so in the case of any claimant whom it is satisfied was under a legal disability by reason of minority or unsoundness of mind at the time at which such claim should otherwise have been made and who applies to it within six months of the cesser of that legal disability. It is not my intention to extend the time limit for applications any further; the closing date for receipt of applications by the tribunal is the 17 June 1996.  Since its inception the tribunal has accepted application forms unsupported by medical data or records.  The tribunal records the applications when received and the claimants or solicitors are  requested to supply outstanding documentation as soon as it becomes available. The tribunal had been receiving a significant number of specific inquiries from the general public and from the legal profession querying whether the lodgment of the application form without the supporting medical data or records before the 17 June 1996 was sufficient to comply with the closing date. The addition to newspaper advertisements to the effect that the application form is accepted by the tribunal without the supporting medical data or records was made to ease the concerns expressed by claimants and solicitors who may be experiencing some difficulties in obtaining medical records or reports before the closing date.  Cases before the tribunal are heard in accordance with the terms of the scheme.  The tribunal relies primarily on written medical reports in its consideration of individual claims.  The claimant must, no later than six weeks before the date fixed by the tribunal for the hearing, submit in writing reports prepared by doctors or other health care professionals who have treated or examined the claimant and relevant reports prepared by other experts on which the claimant intends to rely.  The tribunal has been hearing a maximum of 12 cases each sitting week and I am informed that the hearing of the cases in respect of the applications received to date will carry its workload at least to the end of 1997.  Claims can be listed for hearing before the tribunal on lodgment of all the relevant documentation. I have been informed by the tribunal that any application for a priority hearing has been and will be dealt with sympathetically by the tribunal.  The total number of persons with hepatitis C who had received a blood transfusion or blood product who have been identified to date is 1,356.  The compensation tribunal has to date received 639 applications — at lunch time today the figure was 652.  I have been informed by the tribunal that a  substantial additional number of applications is expected before the closing date.  Since its commencement the tribunal has heard 63 cases.  The awards made to date by the tribunal range from £15,500 to £324,321.  A total sum of approximately £6.67 million has been awarded to date by the compensation tribunal and no tribunal award has been rejected.  The tribunal is running smoothly, fairly and efficiently as had been envisaged and at this stage has hearing dates arranged until 31 July 1996.  The purpose of the Health (Amendment) Act, 1995 is to provide a statutory basis for the provision, to certain persons who have contracted hepatitis C, of general practitioner services, drugs and medical appliances; dental, ophthalmic and aural treatment and dental, aural and optical appliances; counselling; home nursing and home help services, free of charge and without a means test.  The Bill, which passed Fourth and Fifth Stages last week, states:  A health board shall make available without charge to persons who, in the opinion of the Chief Executive Officer of the board, have contracted hepatitis C directly or indirectly from the use of Human Immuno-globulin Anti-D or the receipt within the State of another blood product or a blood transfusion and to persons of such other classes (if any) as may be prescribed.  An amendment giving the chief executive officer of the relevant health board the power to determine eligibility for the proposed services at his discretion was introduced by me on Committee Stage.  Its introduction followed discussions with representatives of Transfusion Positive which was concerned that a small number of its members would experience difficulties in acquiring medical records.  In determining eligibility it is envisaged that the chief executive officer's decision would involve, inter alia, consideration of medical opinion submitted  by the applicant's treating physician and that of the relevant health board's director of public health, Eligibility for the services proposed does not therefore require a determination by a court or by the compensation tribunal.  There may be individuals who, for reasons best known to themselves, might not make a claim to the courts or to the compensation tribunal but who will still be eligible for services to be provided under the Health (Amendment) Bill, 1995, when enacted.  It is proposed that a range of services will be provided under the Act and preliminary discussions have already taken place with some of the relevant bodies. Detailed negotiations cannot commence until the necessary legislation is in place. As soon as the Bill has passed all stages in both Houses, I hope to finalise discussions with the health boards and negotiations with the appropriate professional groups to ensure that the services to be provided under the Act for persons who have been diagnosed positive for hepatitis C will be available to them at an early date.  In December 1995, when I announced the health care package for persons who have contracted hepatitis C, I also indicated that I would establish a statutory consultative council to advise me on matters relating to hepatitis C.  A draft establishment order was circulated to interested groups and I am currently considering a number of amendments to take into account the views expressed by them.  I will again consult with the interested groups at an early date and following such consultation will formally establish the council.  I hope to complete this process as soon as possible. \n Mrs. Geoghegan-Quinn  Does the Minister accept that a significant number of victims of hepatitis C do not have confidence in the tribunal? \n Mr. Noonan  (Limerick East): No.  There is a certain amount of contention about the tribunal which has been stoked up by unnecessary controversy, much of which was stimulated by the Deputy in this House based on inaccurate information.  Some issues are still outstanding between my negotiators in the Department of Health and representatives of one of the interest groups, Positive Action.  It is not true to say there is a lack of confidence in the tribunal.  To date 63 awards have been made fairly and efficiently and, more importantly, no award has been rejected.  That means applicants, with their legal advisers, had enough confidence in the tribunal not only to process their cases through it but to accept the awards in all cases. \n Mrs. Geoghegan-Quinn  Does the Minister know who the 1,356 people are? \n Mr. Noonan  (Limerick East): As I said in my reply, that number of people has been identified. \n Mrs. Geoghegan-Quinn  So they are known. \n Mr. Noonan  (Limerick East): Obviously I would have to go back on records, but the figure is composed of definite numbers for members of Positive Action, that is the cohort of women infected by anti-D product, definite numbers for members of the Haemophiliac Association of Ireland and definite numbers for the Irish Kidney Association.  The variable includes people infected by blood rather than blood product.  We are involved in a look-back programme and a national screening programme, which is continuing. That is the source of the 1,600 cases mentioned in the Deputy's question.  To date the actual number is that which I have given, and that will increase as  tracking and national screening continues. It is our view that the final number is nearer to 1,400 than 1,600.  For three cohorts of people we have definite figures and there is a variable in respect of persons infected by blood rather than blood product. \n Mrs. Geoghegan-Quinn  I thank the Minister for confirming that he and the Department know who the 1,356 persons are.  Why has it cost almost £1,000 of taxpayers' money per application by way of advertising by the State in national newspapers to target persons, who are already known to the Minister, to apply to a tribunal in which the Minister maintains they have confidence? \n Mr. Noonan  (Limerick East): I regard this as a very serious matter.  It is one of the most serious issues of compensation in which the State has been involved for a considerable time and it involves enormous amounts of money.  While we have very good relationships with the interest groups, it is not sufficient to deal with interest groups alone.  Every individual person with hepatitis C or hepatitis C antibodies has individual rights, and not only is there a legal obligation on me but there is a moral responsibility on me to do everything in my power to ensure those people are aware that there is a tribunal in existence through which they may process their claims.  I am reinforcing that opinion because only 652 applications have been made to date out of a cohort of about 1,400.  About 400 people communicated by way of initial solicitors' letters which they issued to protect their own position, but there is huge duplication between those and the 652 applications made to the tribunal — those figures have not been cross-matched.  There are 1,000 people from whom we have not heard.  We have received communication from 652 people plus the number not duplicated, perhaps another 200, and the number of statements of claim before the court is less than 20.  There are about 600 people who for one  reason or other have not communicated with the Department of Health or the Blood Transfusion Service Board by way of initial solicitor's letter indicating that they demand compensation, and who have not applied to the tribunal.  In those circumstances I make no apology for spending money in bringing their rights to people's attention.  There is a missing cohort at present and I hope we will receive applications from them in the next fortnight.  Unless there are deadlines, some solicitors will not complete the paperwork, and the fact that there is a deadline will ensure the paperwork is completed.  We have made it very clear both in the Solicitors Gazette and in the modified advertisements that a completed application form will be sufficient to meet the deadline and that the supporting documentary evidence can be sent in subsequently. There is no change in procedure; that has been the procedure since the tribunal was set up.  We felt it was necessary to advertise that fact because we received many inquiries about whether a completed application form without supporting documentation would be sufficient.  When application forms come in the people in charge of the tribunal, the registrar or secretary to the tribunal, give dates for hearings.  A person would need to have sent in their case in writing six weeks before the date of hearing. This is a contentious issue and I do not mind Deputies taking a political run at me on it, but it is not in the interests of women with hepatitis C or hepatitis C antibodies to be discouraged from applying to the tribunal.  It is not in their interests for me to change the date.  At the rate applications are being processed, there are already sufficient applications before the tribunal to last until the end of 1997.  No injustice will be done to anybody who wants to wait to see what happens in the court case on 8 October.  If that case lasts until Christmas it will still be 12 months from a hearing before the tribunal. If an application has been made to the tribunal it may be withdrawn and  the person may proceed through the courts.  If they proceed through the tribunal and an award is made, having considered the award for four weeks they may say that because they are not satisfied with the award they wish to proceed through the court.  The campaign being conducted to get me to extend the date of 17 June is not in the interests of individual applicants who believe the charges being made. The Deputy is ensuring that the people she purports to represent will go to the end of a very long queue.  I have no doubt that she will then be back next year asking me to appoint extra personnel to the tribunal so that people will get an early hearing. \n An Ceann Comhairle  I am very concerned about the inordinate amount of time devoted to this priority question. Almost all the time available for dealing with priority questions has been exhausted on this one question.  That places the Chair in a most invidious position and puts in jeopardy the taking of Questions Nos. 2 and 3.  I am proceeding forthwith to No. 2. \n Mrs. Geoghegan-Quinn  I wish to ask a final supplementary. \n An Ceann Comhairle  I thought Deputy Geoghegan-Quinn would understand the predicament the Chair is in. \n Mrs. Geoghegan-Quinn  May I ask—— \n An Ceann Comhairle  The Deputy can observe the clock as well as the Chair.  I am calling No. 2. \n Mrs. Geoghegan-Quinn  On a point of order—— \n An Ceann Comhairle  I am on my feet dealing with the rules of the House and I will hear no point of order.  Question No. 2 should be replied to now. \n Mrs. Geoghegan-Quinn  I merely want to point out that the reason for the delay is that the Minister made speeches in reply to each one of the supplementaries. \n An Ceann Comhairle  That is too bad. \n Mrs. Geoghegan-Quinn  It is too bad for all the women victims of hepatitis C. \n Mr. Noonan  (Limerick East): I would be accused of not giving information if I did not give full answers and when I give full answers I am accused of occupying the time of the House. \n An Ceann Comhairle  We have spent 20 minutes on one question, which is unprecedented in dealing with priority questions. \n Mr. Noonan  (Limerick East): The Deputy has organised a debate on this matter for next week.  She will have three hours to rehearse these issues next week in Private Members' time. ",

        "answerText": " Minister for Health (Mr. Noonan,  Limerick East): I propose to take Questions Nos. 1, 19, 27, 32 and 35 together.  It is a matter for each person who has been diagnosed positive for hepatitis C antibodies or hepatitis C virus, as a result of receiving a blood transfusion or a blood product within the State, to decide whether to pursue his or her claim to the courts or to the Compensation Tribunal.  The making of a claim to the tribunal under the scheme does not involve a waiver of any right of action.  During the course of negotiations between my Department and interested groups in November 1995, it was agreed that the time within which a claimant must apply would be extended, from three to six months, as is now the case in the tribunal scheme.  In accordance with the tribunal scheme, claimants must apply within six months of the date on which they first become aware of the fact that they have been diagnosed positive for hepatitis C antibodies or hepatitis C virus or within six months of the date of the establishment of the tribunal, whichever date is the later.  In exceptional cases the tribunal may in its absolute discretion extend the time limit and shall do so in the case of any claimant whom it is satisfied was under a legal disability by reason of minority or unsoundness of mind at the time at which such claim should otherwise have been made and who applies to it within six months of the cesser of that legal disability. It is not my intention to extend the time limit for applications any further; the closing date for receipt of applications by the tribunal is the 17 June 1996.  Since its inception the tribunal has accepted application forms unsupported by medical data or records.  The tribunal records the applications when received and the claimants or solicitors are  requested to supply outstanding documentation as soon as it becomes available. The tribunal had been receiving a significant number of specific inquiries from the general public and from the legal profession querying whether the lodgment of the application form without the supporting medical data or records before the 17 June 1996 was sufficient to comply with the closing date. The addition to newspaper advertisements to the effect that the application form is accepted by the tribunal without the supporting medical data or records was made to ease the concerns expressed by claimants and solicitors who may be experiencing some difficulties in obtaining medical records or reports before the closing date.  Cases before the tribunal are heard in accordance with the terms of the scheme.  The tribunal relies primarily on written medical reports in its consideration of individual claims.  The claimant must, no later than six weeks before the date fixed by the tribunal for the hearing, submit in writing reports prepared by doctors or other health care professionals who have treated or examined the claimant and relevant reports prepared by other experts on which the claimant intends to rely.  The tribunal has been hearing a maximum of 12 cases each sitting week and I am informed that the hearing of the cases in respect of the applications received to date will carry its workload at least to the end of 1997.  Claims can be listed for hearing before the tribunal on lodgment of all the relevant documentation. I have been informed by the tribunal that any application for a priority hearing has been and will be dealt with sympathetically by the tribunal.  The total number of persons with hepatitis C who had received a blood transfusion or blood product who have been identified to date is 1,356.  The compensation tribunal has to date received 639 applications — at lunch time today the figure was 652.  I have been informed by the tribunal that a  substantial additional number of applications is expected before the closing date.  Since its commencement the tribunal has heard 63 cases.  The awards made to date by the tribunal range from £15,500 to £324,321.  A total sum of approximately £6.67 million has been awarded to date by the compensation tribunal and no tribunal award has been rejected.  The tribunal is running smoothly, fairly and efficiently as had been envisaged and at this stage has hearing dates arranged until 31 July 1996.  The purpose of the Health (Amendment) Act, 1995 is to provide a statutory basis for the provision, to certain persons who have contracted hepatitis C, of general practitioner services, drugs and medical appliances; dental, ophthalmic and aural treatment and dental, aural and optical appliances; counselling; home nursing and home help services, free of charge and without a means test.  The Bill, which passed Fourth and Fifth Stages last week, states:  A health board shall make available without charge to persons who, in the opinion of the Chief Executive Officer of the board, have contracted hepatitis C directly or indirectly from the use of Human Immuno-globulin Anti-D or the receipt within the State of another blood product or a blood transfusion and to persons of such other classes (if any) as may be prescribed.  An amendment giving the chief executive officer of the relevant health board the power to determine eligibility for the proposed services at his discretion was introduced by me on Committee Stage.  Its introduction followed discussions with representatives of Transfusion Positive which was concerned that a small number of its members would experience difficulties in acquiring medical records.  In determining eligibility it is envisaged that the chief executive officer's decision would involve, inter alia, consideration of medical opinion submitted  by the applicant's treating physician and that of the relevant health board's director of public health, Eligibility for the services proposed does not therefore require a determination by a court or by the compensation tribunal.  There may be individuals who, for reasons best known to themselves, might not make a claim to the courts or to the compensation tribunal but who will still be eligible for services to be provided under the Health (Amendment) Bill, 1995, when enacted.  It is proposed that a range of services will be provided under the Act and preliminary discussions have already taken place with some of the relevant bodies. Detailed negotiations cannot commence until the necessary legislation is in place. As soon as the Bill has passed all stages in both Houses, I hope to finalise discussions with the health boards and negotiations with the appropriate professional groups to ensure that the services to be provided under the Act for persons who have been diagnosed positive for hepatitis C will be available to them at an early date.  In December 1995, when I announced the health care package for persons who have contracted hepatitis C, I also indicated that I would establish a statutory consultative council to advise me on matters relating to hepatitis C.  A draft establishment order was circulated to interested groups and I am currently considering a number of amendments to take into account the views expressed by them.  I will again consult with the interested groups at an early date and following such consultation will formally establish the council.  I hope to complete this process as soon as possible. \n Mrs. Geoghegan-Quinn  Does the Minister accept that a significant number of victims of hepatitis C do not have confidence in the tribunal? \n Mr. Noonan  (Limerick East): No.  There is a certain amount of contention about the tribunal which has been stoked up by unnecessary controversy, much of which was stimulated by the Deputy in this House based on inaccurate information.

The tribunal has been hearing a maximum of 12 cases each sitting week and I am informed that the hearing of the cases in respect of the applications received to date will carry its workload at least to the end of 1997.  Claims can be listed for hearing before the tribunal on lodgment of all the relevant documentation. I have been informed by the tribunal that any application for a priority hearing has been and will be dealt with sympathetically by the tribunal.  The total number of persons with hepatitis C who had received a blood transfusion or blood product who have been identified to date is 1,356.  The compensation tribunal has to date received 639 applications — at lunch time today the figure was 652.  I have been informed by the tribunal that a  substantial additional number of applications is expected before the closing date.  Since its commencement the tribunal has heard 63 cases.  The awards made to date by the tribunal range from £15,500 to £324,321.  A total sum of approximately £6.67 million has been awarded to date by the compensation tribunal and no tribunal award has been rejected.  The tribunal is running smoothly, fairly and efficiently as had been envisaged and at this stage has hearing dates arranged until 31 July 1996.  The purpose of the Health (Amendment) Act, 1995 is to provide a statutory basis for the provision, to certain persons who have contracted hepatitis C, of general practitioner services, drugs and medical appliances; dental, ophthalmic and aural treatment and dental, aural and optical appliances; counselling; home nursing and home help services, free of charge and without a means test.  The Bill, which passed Fourth and Fifth Stages last week, states:  A health board shall make available without charge to persons who, in the opinion of the Chief Executive Officer of the board, have contracted hepatitis C directly or indirectly from the use of Human Immuno-globulin Anti-D or the receipt within the State of another blood product or a blood transfusion and to persons of such other classes (if any) as may be prescribed.  An amendment giving the chief executive officer of the relevant health board the power to determine eligibility for the proposed services at his discretion was introduced by me on Committee Stage.  Its introduction followed discussions with representatives of Transfusion Positive which was concerned that a small number of its members would experience difficulties in acquiring medical records.  In determining eligibility it is envisaged that the chief executive officer's decision would involve, inter alia, consideration of medical opinion submitted  by the applicant's treating physician and that of the relevant health board's director of public health, Eligibility for the services proposed does not therefore require a determination by a court or by the compensation tribunal.  There may be individuals who, for reasons best known to themselves, might not make a claim to the courts or to the compensation tribunal but who will still be eligible for services to be provided under the Health (Amendment) Bill, 1995, when enacted.  It is proposed that a range of services will be provided under the Act and preliminary discussions have already taken place with some of the relevant bodies. Detailed negotiations cannot commence until the necessary legislation is in place. As soon as the Bill has passed all stages in both Houses, I hope to finalise discussions with the health boards and negotiations with the appropriate professional groups to ensure that the services to be provided under the Act for persons who have been diagnosed positive for hepatitis C will be available to them at an early date.  In December 1995, when I announced the health care package for persons who have contracted hepatitis C, I also indicated that I would establish a statutory consultative council to advise me on matters relating to hepatitis C.  A draft establishment order was circulated to interested groups and I am currently considering a number of amendments to take into account the views expressed by them.  I will again consult with the interested groups at an early date and following such consultation will formally establish the council.  I hope to complete this process as soon as possible. \n Mrs. Geoghegan-Quinn  Does the Minister accept that a significant number of victims of hepatitis C do not have confidence in the tribunal? \n Mr. Noonan  (Limerick East): No.  There is a certain amount of contention about the tribunal which has been stoked up by unnecessary controversy, much of which was stimulated by the Deputy in this House based on inaccurate information.  Some issues are still outstanding between my negotiators in the Department of Health and representatives of one of the interest groups, Positive Action.  It is not true to say there is a lack of confidence in the tribunal.  To date 63 awards have been made fairly and efficiently and, more importantly, no award has been rejected.  That means applicants, with their legal advisers, had enough confidence in the tribunal not only to process their cases through it but to accept the awards in all cases. \n Mrs. Geoghegan-Quinn  Does the Minister know who the 1,356 people are? \n Mr. Noonan  (Limerick East): As I said in my reply, that number of people has been identified. \n Mrs. Geoghegan-Quinn  So they are known. \n Mr. Noonan  (Limerick East): Obviously I would have to go back on records, but the figure is composed of definite numbers for members of Positive Action, that is the cohort of women infected by anti-D product, definite numbers for members of the Haemophiliac Association of Ireland and definite numbers for the Irish Kidney Association.  The variable includes people infected by blood rather than blood product.  We are involved in a look-back programme and a national screening programme, which is continuing. That is the source of the 1,600 cases mentioned in the Deputy's question.  To date the actual number is that which I have given, and that will increase as  tracking and national screening continues. It is our view that the final number is nearer to 1,400 than 1,600.  For three cohorts of people we have definite figures and there is a variable in respect of persons infected by blood rather than blood product. \n Mrs. Geoghegan-Quinn  I thank the Minister for confirming that he and the Department know who the 1,356 persons are.  Why has it cost almost £1,000 of taxpayers' money per application by way of advertising by the State in national newspapers to target persons, who are already known to the Minister, to apply to a tribunal in which the Minister maintains they have confidence? \n Mr. Noonan  (Limerick East): I regard this as a very serious matter.  It is one of the most serious issues of compensation in which the State has been involved for a considerable time and it involves enormous amounts of money.  While we have very good relationships with the interest groups, it is not sufficient to deal with interest groups alone.  Every individual person with hepatitis C or hepatitis C antibodies has individual rights, and not only is there a legal obligation on me but there is a moral responsibility on me to do everything in my power to ensure those people are aware that there is a tribunal in existence through which they may process their claims.  I am reinforcing that opinion because only 652 applications have been made to date out of a cohort of about 1,400.  About 400 people communicated by way of initial solicitors' letters which they issued to protect their own position, but there is huge duplication between those and the 652 applications made to the tribunal — those figures have not been cross-matched.  There are 1,000 people from whom we have not heard.  We have received communication from 652 people plus the number not duplicated, perhaps another 200, and the number of statements of claim before the court is less than 20.  There are about 600 people who for one  reason or other have not communicated with the Department of Health or the Blood Transfusion Service Board by way of initial solicitor's letter indicating that they demand compensation, and who have not applied to the tribunal.  In those circumstances I make no apology for spending money in bringing their rights to people's attention.  There is a missing cohort at present and I hope we will receive applications from them in the next fortnight.  Unless there are deadlines, some solicitors will not complete the paperwork, and the fact that there is a deadline will ensure the paperwork is completed.  We have made it very clear both in the Solicitors Gazette and in the modified advertisements that a completed application form will be sufficient to meet the deadline and that the supporting documentary evidence can be sent in subsequently. There is no change in procedure; that has been the procedure since the tribunal was set up.  We felt it was necessary to advertise that fact because we received many inquiries about whether a completed application form without supporting documentation would be sufficient.  When application forms come in the people in charge of the tribunal, the registrar or secretary to the tribunal, give dates for hearings.  A person would need to have sent in their case in writing six weeks before the date of hearing. This is a contentious issue and I do not mind Deputies taking a political run at me on it, but it is not in the interests of women with hepatitis C or hepatitis C antibodies to be discouraged from applying to the tribunal.  It is not in their interests for me to change the date.  At the rate applications are being processed, there are already sufficient applications before the tribunal to last until the end of 1997.  No injustice will be done to anybody who wants to wait to see what happens in the court case on 8 October.  If that case lasts until Christmas it will still be 12 months from a hearing before the tribunal. If an application has been made to the tribunal it may be withdrawn and  the person may proceed through the courts.  If they proceed through the tribunal and an award is made, having considered the award for four weeks they may say that because they are not satisfied with the award they wish to proceed through the court.  The campaign being conducted to get me to extend the date of 17 June is not in the interests of individual applicants who believe the charges being made. The Deputy is ensuring that the people she purports to represent will go to the end of a very long queue.  I have no doubt that she will then be back next year asking me to appoint extra personnel to the tribunal so that people will get an early hearing. \n An Ceann Comhairle  I am very concerned about the inordinate amount of time devoted to this priority question. Almost all the time available for dealing with priority questions has been exhausted on this one question.  That places the Chair in a most invidious position and puts in jeopardy the taking of Questions Nos. 2 and 3.  I am proceeding forthwith to No. 2. \n Mrs. Geoghegan-Quinn  I wish to ask a final supplementary. \n An Ceann Comhairle  I thought Deputy Geoghegan-Quinn would understand the predicament the Chair is in. \n Mrs. Geoghegan-Quinn  May I ask—— \n An Ceann Comhairle  The Deputy can observe the clock as well as the Chair.  I am calling No. 2. \n Mrs. Geoghegan-Quinn  On a point of order—— \n An Ceann Comhairle  I am on my feet dealing with the rules of the House and I will hear no point of order.  Question No. 2 should be replied to now. \n Mrs. Geoghegan-Quinn  I merely want to point out that the reason for the delay is that the Minister made speeches in reply to each one of the supplementaries. \n An Ceann Comhairle  That is too bad. \n Mrs. Geoghegan-Quinn  It is too bad for all the women victims of hepatitis C. \n Mr. Noonan  (Limerick East): I would be accused of not giving information if I did not give full answers and when I give full answers I am accused of occupying the time of the House. \n An Ceann Comhairle  We have spent 20 minutes on one question, which is unprecedented in dealing with priority questions. \n Mr. Noonan  (Limerick East): The Deputy has organised a debate on this matter for next week.  She will have three hours to rehearse these issues next week in Private Members' time. ",

McDowell asked the Minister for Health the way in which entitlement to services under the Health Amendment Act, 1995, will be determined; whether cases for compensation will be determined by a court or a tribunal before the services are granted; and if he will make a statement on the matter.\n      [11766/96] ",
        "answerText": " Minister for Health (Mr. Noonan,  Limerick East): I propose to take Questions Nos. 1, 19, 27, 32 and 35 together.  It is a matter for each person who has been diagnosed positive for hepatitis C antibodies or hepatitis C virus, as a result of receiving a blood transfusion or a blood product within the State, to decide whether to pursue his or her claim to the courts or to the Compensation Tribunal.  The making of a claim to the tribunal under the scheme does not involve a waiver of any right of action.  During the course of negotiations between my Department and interested groups in November 1995, it was agreed that the time within which a claimant must apply would be extended, from three to six months, as is now the case in the tribunal scheme.  In accordance with the tribunal scheme, claimants must apply within six months of the date on which they first become aware of the fact that they have been diagnosed positive for hepatitis C antibodies or hepatitis C virus or within six months of the date of the establishment of the tribunal, whichever date is the later.  In exceptional cases the tribunal may in its absolute discretion extend the time limit and shall do so in the case of any claimant whom it is satisfied was under a legal disability by reason of minority or unsoundness of mind at the time at which such claim should otherwise have been made and who applies to it within six months of the cesser of that legal disability. It is not my intention to extend the time limit for applications any further; the closing date for receipt of applications by the tribunal is the 17 June 1996.  Since its inception the tribunal has accepted application forms unsupported by medical data or records.  The tribunal records the applications when received and the claimants or solicitors are  requested to supply outstanding documentation as soon as it becomes available. The tribunal had been receiving a significant number of specific inquiries from the general public and from the legal profession querying whether the lodgment of the application form without the supporting medical data or records before the 17 June 1996 was sufficient to comply with the closing date. The addition to newspaper advertisements to the effect that the application form is accepted by the tribunal without the supporting medical data or records was made to ease the concerns expressed by claimants and solicitors who may be experiencing some difficulties in obtaining medical records or reports before the closing date.  Cases before the tribunal are heard in accordance with the terms of the scheme.  The tribunal relies primarily on written medical reports in its consideration of individual claims.  The claimant must, no later than six weeks before the date fixed by the tribunal for the hearing, submit in writing reports prepared by doctors or other health care professionals who have treated or examined the claimant and relevant reports prepared by other experts on which the claimant intends to rely.

        "answerText": " Mr. Quinn  Over the past number of years Ireland has been undergoing a programme of tax changes with a view to increasing competitiveness and growth and thereby contributing to the maintenance and creation of sustainable employment.  A key element in these changes, under successive Governments, has been to broaden the tax base and to seek to redress the tendency for earned income to contribute an increasing share of total revenues.  A number of allowances, reliefs and exemptions have been abolished, restricted or refocused across several tax heads.  These measures have enabled tax rates to be reduced and the proportion of earned income taken in tax to be lessened.  Clearly there is further scope for widening the tax base.  This is a matter which receives ongoing consideration each year prior to the budget.  The Tax Strategy Group has on a number of occasions examined the issue of base broadening.  There have been recent proposals also by Forfás in the VAT and property tax areas.  There is also scope for restricting or eliminating reliefs and allowances to make more resources available for tax reduction. The Deputy can be assured that all relevant base broadening options will be  examined yet again in the run-up to next year's budget. \n Mr. M. McDowell  I am interested in the fact that the Minister referred to the Forfás report.  Expanding the VAT net and having more tax allowances at the standard rate, which the report mentions, are either on the agenda or they are not.  I ask the Minister to indicate if they are on the agenda and if the Government is seriously contemplating expanding the VAT net to food or introducing personal allowances only at the 27 per cent rate. \n Mr. Quinn  The Fortás report was published only last Thursday.  We will have a comprehensive debate on it in this House before we break for the summer recess and that will provide a better opportunity to address the Deputy's questions in detail.  All measures designed at improving the overall competitive position of the Irish economy, which include inter alia the lessening of the tax burden on earned income, are being and will continue to be looked at in the Department. \n Mr. M. McDowell  I take it from the Minister's reply that extending VAT to food and having more tax allowances at the standard rate are potentially on the agenda.  The Minister referred to property taxes.  The Forfás report mentions levels of services provided and ability to pay. Does that imply a new form of funding for local government?  Could the Minister indicate if it is proposed to transfer the burden of tax on work into some form of finance for local government? \n Mr. Quinn  Less than a week after its publication it would be wrong and it would do a great disservice to the people who worked hard to produce the Forfás report to respond in precise detail to one of the many measures it suggests we should look at in the context of enhancing our performance over the next 15 years.  There will be a debate in this House on the overall thrust of the  report and on the various measures it outlines.  As regards the question on local authority taxation, the Deputy knows from a previous answer I gave in this House that my colleague, the Minister for the Environment, has commissioned a study in this regard in line with A Government of Renewal. When that document is available it will be debated in full and we will look at the options in that context. Any other answer at this stage, no matter how much the Deputy might like me to reply, would be premature. \n Mr. M. McDowell  Is it not the case that the study commissioned by the Minister for the Environment to look at the options for funding local government is already available?  Did we not read in the newspapers a number of weeks ago that it will be given to Opposition parties to study?  Why has nothing happened in the meantime? \n Mr. Quinn  That is a matter for the Minister for the Environment.  I do not have detailed information with me but, as far as I am aware, that is a matter which has yet to be formally decided by the Government. \n Mr. M. McDowell  Is it the case that the publication of the Forfás report has had no effect on the Government's intentions as regards widening the tax base and that the Government will consider the possibilities before every budget, as it always does, and then make its mind up?  Is that the bottom line? \n Mr. Quinn  That is not the bottom line and the Deputy is being disingenous. We are talking about a huge document which covers the economy's performance over the next 15 years and which is not yet seven days' old.  For the Deputy to suggest that replies to questions which were put down prior to its publication or soon afterwards should take into detailed account possible options in a document which covers an extraordinarily wide range of issues  over the next 15 years is nonsense and the Deputy knows that.

        "answerText": " Mr. Quinn  Over the past number of years Ireland has been undergoing a programme of tax changes with a view to increasing competitiveness and growth and thereby contributing to the maintenance and creation of sustainable employment.  A key element in these changes, under successive Governments, has been to broaden the tax base and to seek to redress the tendency for earned income to contribute an increasing share of total revenues.  A number of allowances, reliefs and exemptions have been abolished, restricted or refocused across several tax heads.  These measures have enabled tax rates to be reduced and the proportion of earned income taken in tax to be lessened.  Clearly there is further scope for widening the tax base.  This is a matter which receives ongoing consideration each year prior to the budget.  The Tax Strategy Group has on a number of occasions examined the issue of base broadening.  There have been recent proposals also by Forfás in the VAT and property tax areas.  There is also scope for restricting or eliminating reliefs and allowances to make more resources available for tax reduction. The Deputy can be assured that all relevant base broadening options will be  examined yet again in the run-up to next year's budget. \n Mr. M. McDowell  I am interested in the fact that the Minister referred to the Forfás report.  Expanding the VAT net and having more tax allowances at the standard rate, which the report mentions, are either on the agenda or they are not.  I ask the Minister to indicate if they are on the agenda and if the Government is seriously contemplating expanding the VAT net to food or introducing personal allowances only at the 27 per cent rate. \n Mr. Quinn  The Fortás report was published only last Thursday.  We will have a comprehensive debate on it in this House before we break for the summer recess and that will provide a better opportunity to address the Deputy's questions in detail.  All measures designed at improving the overall competitive position of the Irish economy, which include inter alia the lessening of the tax burden on earned income, are being and will continue to be looked at in the Department. \n Mr. M. McDowell  I take it from the Minister's reply that extending VAT to food and having more tax allowances at the standard rate are potentially on the agenda.  The Minister referred to property taxes.

        "showAs": " 3 Mr. M. McDowell asked the Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs the effect, if any, he anticipates the new British attitude of non co-operation with the EU, as recently annunciated by the British Prime Minister, will have on the Union; and the effect, if any, it will have on Ireland's forthcoming Presidency of the EU and the work programme of that Presidency.\n      [11278/96] ",
        "answerText": " Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Spring)  I propose to take Questions Nos. 1 and 3 together.  On 21 May, Prime Minister Major announced in the House of Commons that without progress towards lifting the ban on the export of the British beef, Britain could not be expected to co-operate normally on other Community business.  He indicated that progress would not be possible in the intergovernmental conference or elsewhere until Britain had agreement on lifting the ban on beef derivatives — tallow, semen and gelatine — and a clear framework in place leading to lifting of the wider ban.  In the light of the Prime Minister's statement British Ministers and officials have blocked the adoption of measures and conclusions where unanimity is required in the Council.  British action was taken in response to the failure of the Standing Veterinary Committee at its meeting on 20 May to give a positive opinion on Commission proposals to lift the ban on the export of derivatives.  The issue now goes to the Agriculture Council at its meeting in Luxembourg on Monday next.  If Agriculture Ministers fail to decide then it will fall to the Commission to assume its responsibilities and to lift the ban on the derivatives.  Ireland has supported and will continue to support the Commission's proposals on the derivatives.  Ireland has a major interest in the restoration of confidence in the beef industry within the Union.  We also have a vital interest in the restoration of confidence in European beef in third country markets.  The strength of the European Union lies in its capacity to demonstrate solidarity and reach European solutions, even to apparently intractable problems. Confidence can be restored only if the member states act together showing solidarity with each other.  The solution to mutual concerns can be found only in common action and decisions on the basis of sound scientific advice.  This involves member states demonstrating, as Ireland has done, an understanding of British concerns, including the seriousness of the problem of BSE and its impact on British public opinion. Equally, the restoration of confidence involves an understanding by Britain of the legitimate concerns of partners.  I regret the actions taken by the British Government.  They pose problems for the conduct of Union business.  It does not serve anyone's interest that the Union's freedom of action should be impaired.  For instance, it cannot be in anyone's interest that agreement be held up on measures designed to ensure the efficient operation of the Single Market from which all member states, not least Britain, have benefited.  Similar considerations apply in other areas such as development co-operation and EUROPOL.  At present the problem of British non co-operation is one to be dealt with by the Italian Presidency.  I understand that Italy is in contact with Britain at the highest level to find a solution to the BSE problem and to urge a measured approach.  I support the Presidency in its efforts.  I also support the determined efforts being made by the European Commission to find a solution.  I hope that a solution can be found at Union level to British concerns before Ireland assumes the Presidency.  It is too  early to say at this stage what the effect of continued UK non co-operation might be although I am sure that in any event our partners will want to continue to make progress on the Union agenda to defend the gains of European integration. Finally, it is worth recalling that all member states, including the UK, depend on an effectively functioning European Union.  It is in everyone's interest to avoid a spiral of actions and reactions which in some circumstances could have a very damaging effect on the operation of Union policies. \n Mr. R. Burke  Will the Minister agree that the so-called mad cow disease problem not only affects Britain but it is having a huge effect on our economy?  The beef industry is our largest industry. Will the Minister agree that the Government and all its agencies should make every effort to persuade the British to end its non co-operation with Europe and to assist hard pressed farmers in finding markets? \n Mr. Spring  I have little to add to my formal reply.  One must accept this is a serious problem for the Irish economy which is evident from the debate.  It is a problem the Taoiseach, myself, other Government Ministers, including the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry, our embassies abroad and the State agencies have set out to address in every fora to do everything possible to reinstate confidence in the Irish beef industry.  We will continue to do that and I know we have the support of every Member given the importance of the beef sector in the Irish economy.  It is a European problem which impacts severely on our economy and one which we want to bring to a conclusion as quickly as possible.  It is currently very much a problem for the Italian Presidency as we are now in the lead-up to the European summit in Florence.  I know from my brief discussion yesterday with the Italian Foreign Minister, Mr. Dini, that he intends to have discussions with his British counterpart. The new Italian Prime Minister has  been in contact with the British Prime Minister to see if a resolution can be found.  The meeting of the Agriculture Ministers on Monday next in Brussels will be an important one.  If the ban on derivatives can be lifted in the first instance, we can move on to finding an ultimate resolution. \n Mr. R. Burke  Will the Minister tell the House the reason he has not visited any of the third countries with which we have markets in order to assist the beef industry?  The Minister will be aware that in third countries decisions are taken at a political level in relation to purchasing of products, particularly beef, and yet he has not visited any country as Minister for Foreign Affairs. Why has he been so negligent in relation to that issue? \n Mr. Spring  I do not accept Deputy Burke's allegation that I have been negligent in my duties.  The Government has taken steps as appropriate in relation to this difficulty.  The Taoiseach, the Minister of State and myself have had conversations with various Ministers in third countries, we have made a certain degree of progress and will continue to monitor the situation. \n Mr. M. McDowell  Is the Minister hopeful that the Italian Presidency will succeed in resolving the issue between the EU and Britain?  Has the Minister any assurances to that effect and what contingency plans has he laid against the possibility that we will have a non-functioning European Union when Ireland takes over the Presidency a few weeks from now? \n Mr. Spring  I gave an indication of our thoughts on that matter when I replied formally to the question set down by Deputy Burke.  One has to appreciate the fact that the problem of BSE affects all member states of the European Union.  The resolution to the problem will be found only by a restoration of confidence in the beef industry  in the European Union and by all member states acting together and showing solidarity.  I said to Deputy Burke, in the formal reply and in the supplementary, that a number of weeks remain of the Italian Presidency.  I had discussions yesterday with the Italian Foreign Minister and I know that at highest level there have been discussions between the Italian Presidency of the European Union and the British Government.  We have to support those efforts.  The meeting of the Agricultural Council on Monday next will have a significant bearing on the seriousness of the problems facing the Irish Presidency.  BSE will remain an issue during our Presidency.  It would be foolish to think otherwise, given the scale of the existing problem.  On assuming the Presidency, and indeed in preparing for it, we will analyse the issue in light of future developments, including for example the Agricultural Council meeting next Monday. We will work with our partners towards finding solutions to the problems posed by the BSE crisis. \n Mr. M. McDowell  May I suggest that one might usefully import a twin-track approach from other negotiations?  The Minister might, for instance, put the beef derivatives into a particular category. Will he agree there is a strong case to be made for making concessions to the United Kingdom, on some of the derivatives at any rate, in order to create some sense of momentum in that country and enable them to feel they are in a process which is resolving the issue, rather than coming up against a stone wall? \n Mr. Spring  As I said, we have supported the proposal to lift the ban on the derivatives and we will continue to do so, based on the technical veterinary advice available to us.  If that happens next Monday, it will be a step in the right direction.  We can then have a discussion with the British Government at European level to work out a satisfactory timeframe for the resolution of the larger problem. ",

        "showAs": " 31 Mr. M. McDowell asked the Minister for Transport, Energy and Communications the changes in the EU Draft Directive on Electricity which he will be proposing at the Council meeting to finalise this Directive before the end of the Italian Presidency of the EU in June 1996; and if he will make a statement on the matter.\n      [10863/96] ",
        "answerText": " Mr. Lowry  I propose to take Questions Nos. 19, 20, 31 and 38 together.  The revised draft electricity directive circulated by the Commission in February, 1994 provided for a relatively modest degree of liberalisation of the single electricity market.  However, since 1994, and particularly with the advent of the three new member states, there has been a considerable shift of opinion among member states in favour of a much greater degree of liberalisation of the market.  The compromised proposal by the Italian Presidency discussed at the May 1996 Energy Council reflects this shift.  However, a number of member states consider that it does not move sufficiently quickly towards liberalisation whereas only one or two favour a more gradual approach.  The precise extent of market opening provided for in the directive will emerge from negotiations at the extraordinary Energy Council of 19-20 June.  At the June Council I will put the Irish position that while we favour a planned approach, the Government has acknowledged there has to be market freedom for large electricity consumers to purchase their electricity from whomever they wish.  This will introduce competition for the ESB in this segment of the market for the first time.  I will also be very clear that electricity is a vital industry and we should make changes in a planned and prudent manner.  While further liberalisation is inevitable, we should review the outcome of a first phase before deciding to move on to the next.  At the May Council I made it clear to my European colleagues that the critical issue for Ireland was a clear commitment to the principle of public service obligations. Agreement has now been reached on this issue.  This deals effectively with my primary concern to prevent cherry picking of the larger more lucrative customers and to ensure that the interests of the smaller consumer are fully protected.  I have also  obtained the necessary provisions to ensure that we can continue to generate electricity from indigenous peat thus assuring the future of Bord na Móna and of more than 2,000 jobs in the midlands.  The draft directive will inevitably have a significant impact on the ESB.  If implemented as the text currently stands, the directive would mean a substantial immediate degree of liberalisation of the Irish market with a progressive widening of the number of customers who will be eligible to contract directly with independent power producers.  My Department estimates that 25 per cent of the ESB's market would immediately be open to competition if the proposal becomes law.  This will represent a significant opportunity for customers and present a challenge for the ESB.  I expect the introduction of significant levels of competition will bring considerable downward pressure on electricity prices.  I am confident that the ESB is taking the necessary steps to prepare for the challenges that competition will bring.  I see no reason the ESB should not prosper in a new open more liberalised market.  I stress, however, that this makes the full implementation of the CCR now more urgent than ever. \n Mr. Molloy  What percentage of the Irish market did the Minister envisage would be opened up to competition under the EU Directive when he devised and agreed to the ESB's proposals for the cost and competitiveness review?  In view of the size of the market that will now be opened up to outside generators of electricity to sell electricity to our large consumers, does the Minister consider that the cost and competitiveness review might prove insufficient to ensure that the ESB will be capable of meeting the level of competition it will now have to face? \n Mr. Lowry  It is difficult to anticipate the outcome of the last Energy Council  meeting under the Presidency of the Italians. There is a huge difference between the stance taken by the majority of countries and that taken, for instance, by the Italians, the French and ourselves.  I have already said we envisage a 25 per cent opening, but I cannot say that it can be held at that.  There is a huge lobby within the European Union at the moment to liberalise the market to an even greater extent. Obviously, we have put forward the Irish position in a vociferous and forceful way.  We have a very small system and there are peculiarities which are unique to it.  We have put that view forward.  In respect of implementing this change when it arises, as recently as late last week I had a meeting with the chairman and chief executive of the ESB.  We have gone through the proposals in detail and have discussed the likely outcome. Arising from those discussions I am quite confident the management of the ESB has the necessary professionalism and skill to ensure that the CCR will put the company in a position to be able to take on whatever degree of competition comes in.  As of now, it is envisaged that will be anything between 25 and 40 per cent.  The Irish position is that it should be gradual and that we should approach it in a prudent fashion. In the negotiations we will attempt to limit it, as near as possible, to 25 per cent. \n Mr. Molloy  The Minister will recall that when the cost and competitiveness review was originally published it was intended to achieve a reduction of 3,000 in the numbers employed in the ESB and savings of £100 million.  None of these target figures was achieved.  The figure for job savings is estimated now at 2,000 and the saving in annual costs is approximately £60 million.  My question has not been answered.  When the cost and competitiveness review was being drawn up, what percentage of the electricity market was it envisaged would be opened up to competition?  Obviously, from what the Minister has said, 1994  brought about a change in the percentage of the market liable to be opened up to competition.  Prior to 1994 the expectation at departmental and ESB level must have been much lower than the current minimum estimate of 25 per cent; it could be as high as 40 per cent. What percentage of the market was expected to be opened up at the time the cost and competitiveness review was being decided upon? \n Mr. Lowry  The CCR was not formulated at the time of the opening up of the electricity market.  As the Deputy is aware, we engaged in the CCR—— \n Mr. Molloy  It was to prepare the company for competition. \n Mr. Lowry  ——arising from the independent consultant's report which established that the cost base of the company was running in the region of £100 million per annum in excess of what it should be.  Following prolonged discussions, agreement was reached on the CCR which reduces the cost base by £58 million per annum.  When the CCR is fully implemented, the company will be in a position to compete in a competitive environment, which liberalisation of the market will inevitably mean for the ESB.  I am satisfied the ESB is fully aware that it is crucial for the company to implement the CCR in full, ensure there is downward pressure on an ongoing basis on its cost base and reduce its overheads. \n Mr. Molloy  Will the Minister give an assurance to the House that the ESB will not resort to increasing electricity prices to domestic consumers to compensate for its lack of competitiveness because of its failure to achieve the original targets in the cost and competitiveness review? \n Mr. Lowry  Not only can I give that assurance but I have already raised this matter with the company and it has  been made clear that under no circumstance will consumers in Ireland be asked to pay for inefficiencies or deficiencies in the company.  The overrun on cost base cannot be allowed to be passed on to householders. \n Mr. S. Brennan  The Minister may wish to qualify the answer he has just given because I understand the CCR documentation, which the Minister stood over, contains the phrase \"necessary rebalancing in prices will take place\".  Does that mean that if the market opens up and competition is introduced, price increases will transfer from large industry to the ordinary consumer? An evening newspaper yesterday carried the story that we are facing an increase in prices of approximately one-third in the next few years.  Perhaps the Minister might rethink the answer he gave to Deputy Molloy based on his commitment to the CCR process of rebalancing the charges.  I understand that to mean that the rebalancing will be away from large industry in the competitive area to the consumer because the Minister will have to get the money from somewhere. \n Mr. Lowry  The implementation of the CCR package that has been brought forward and agreed is cost effective.  It will pay for itself over a four and a half year period and will thereafter result in significant savings to the cost base of the company.  I have given a categoric assurance that a situation will not be allowed to develop whereby the CCR plan will be funded by consumers. \n Mr. Molloy  Domestic consumers. \n Mr. Lowry  In relation to tariffs, we have already agreed a modest price increase over the next three years which contains an element of rebalancing.  We have already seen the first measures in respect of rebalancing.  It is inevitable that there will be rebalancing in years to come but I cannot anticipate its extent or when it will occur. \n Mr. S. Brennan  I thank the Minister for his honesty in admitting that rebalancing has only begun, by way of the 2 per cent or 3 per cent on present prices, and it seems that process will continue. \n Mr. Lowry  There is a huge difference between that and 13 per cent. \n Mr. S. Brennan  The Minister said the Government acknowledges that large consumers will be able to buy electricity from whom they wish.  How does he square the circle?  If large consumers can buy from whom they wish, and presuming they buy cheaper imported electricity, if the Minister does not allow any further redundancies in the ESB on a massive scale, it is logical that the ordinary householder will face dramatically increased electricity bills in the next four or five years.  There is no other answer to this problem.  Bills may increase by one-third. \n Mr. Lowry  Absolutely not.  That is speculation.  We are currently restructuring the electricity industry in Ireland. We are allowing for competition and that inevitably reduces prices for consumers. \n Mr. B. O'Keeffe  The restructuring was based on a 13 per cent share of the open market but the Minister has admitted the current figure is 25 per cent and that it could rise to 40 per cent.  Will the Minister agree that, having been out-manoeuvred in the EU discussions, he is now placing the ESB in a dilemma? The only effect of, say, a 33 per cent stake on the German market, for instance, would be in relation to heavy industry, but if the market were to open on that basis in Ireland every major industrial and commercial company would be affected by this process.  The inevitability is that we will have to increase prices dramatically to the commercial, industrial and domestic consumer. \n Mr. Lowry  We have not been out-manoeuvred; we have been outnumbered at EU level.  There is a major force within the EU seeking liberalisation of the electricity market.  That force is being led by Germany which is seeking a 100 per cent opening up of the market, supported strongly by the Scandinavian countries which are anxious to ensure that the maximum percentage possible is available to open competition. We have clearly stated the Irish position.  That position has developed as a result of an in-depth evaluation of our own system.  We have put that position very forcefully and we will engage in further discussions to finalise this matter at the Energy Council meeting under the Italian Presidency.  I cannot speculate on the outcome of those discussions but there are many pro-liberalisation forces involved. \n Mr. Molloy  As part of the CCR proposals an arrangement was entered into whereby the ESB group of unions accepted the proposals in the CCR and the Minister would sanction phases 2 and 3 of the Poolbeg gas-powered station.  Has the ESB been told it can proceed with the building of the additional phases of Poolbeg?  Has that decision been conveyed formally to the ESB? \n Mr. Lowry  The CCR involved a tripartite procedure to which the Government made a contribution.  Part of that contribution was a commitment that if the company and its workforce accept the rationalisation, its programme and the necessary structuring, the Government would agree to allow Poolbeg II and III to proceed.  As recently as last week I had discussions with the management of the company in that respect.  I await further documentation from them. As soon as I am satisfied in respect of the information I have sought we will give them permission to proceed. \n Mr. Molloy  Will the Minister agree that this in effect was shutting out competition, that the electricity demand will  be well met from the increase in generating capacity which has been approved for Poolbeg, that it diminishes the attractiveness of Ireland as a location for building new power stations and that he has sought to pre-empt and delay the opportunities for large companies to benefit from the terms of this directive when it comes fully into effect?  Is it intended to continue with the ESB as the owner and regulator of the electricity industry?  Are there proposals to ensure that the regulation of the electricity industry is at arm's length from the ESB and the Department and that there is fair competition for anybody who sees an opportunity to come in and build a generating station and import electricity through the North when the interconnector with Scotland is achieved? \n Mr. Lowry  There is a huge growth in the demand for electricity capacity in this country.  The growth this year is expected to be over 5 per cent, more than 200 megawatts per year. \n Mr. Molloy  It has been like that every year for the last ten. \n Mr. Lowry  This means that Poolbeg II and III are necessary for the ESB to keep up with the demand placed on it. \n Mr. Molloy  It could have been provided by private companies. \n Mr. Lowry  The legislation in respect of the regulator is almost ready for publication and will cover all the aspects the Deputy mentioned.

        "answerText": " Mr. Lowry  I propose to take Questions Nos. 19, 20, 31 and 38 together.  The revised draft electricity directive circulated by the Commission in February, 1994 provided for a relatively modest degree of liberalisation of the single electricity market.  However, since 1994, and particularly with the advent of the three new member states, there has been a considerable shift of opinion among member states in favour of a much greater degree of liberalisation of the market.  The compromised proposal by the Italian Presidency discussed at the May 1996 Energy Council reflects this shift.  However, a number of member states consider that it does not move sufficiently quickly towards liberalisation whereas only one or two favour a more gradual approach.  The precise extent of market opening provided for in the directive will emerge from negotiations at the extraordinary Energy Council of 19-20 June.  At the June Council I will put the Irish position that while we favour a planned approach, the Government has acknowledged there has to be market freedom for large electricity consumers to purchase their electricity from whomever they wish.  This will introduce competition for the ESB in this segment of the market for the first time.  I will also be very clear that electricity is a vital industry and we should make changes in a planned and prudent manner.  While further liberalisation is inevitable, we should review the outcome of a first phase before deciding to move on to the next.  At the May Council I made it clear to my European colleagues that the critical issue for Ireland was a clear commitment to the principle of public service obligations. Agreement has now been reached on this issue.  This deals effectively with my primary concern to prevent cherry picking of the larger more lucrative customers and to ensure that the interests of the smaller consumer are fully protected.  I have also  obtained the necessary provisions to ensure that we can continue to generate electricity from indigenous peat thus assuring the future of Bord na Móna and of more than 2,000 jobs in the midlands.  The draft directive will inevitably have a significant impact on the ESB.  If implemented as the text currently stands, the directive would mean a substantial immediate degree of liberalisation of the Irish market with a progressive widening of the number of customers who will be eligible to contract directly with independent power producers.  My Department estimates that 25 per cent of the ESB's market would immediately be open to competition if the proposal becomes law.  This will represent a significant opportunity for customers and present a challenge for the ESB.  I expect the introduction of significant levels of competition will bring considerable downward pressure on electricity prices.  I am confident that the ESB is taking the necessary steps to prepare for the challenges that competition will bring.  I see no reason the ESB should not prosper in a new open more liberalised market.  I stress, however, that this makes the full implementation of the CCR now more urgent than ever. \n Mr. Molloy  What percentage of the Irish market did the Minister envisage would be opened up to competition under the EU Directive when he devised and agreed to the ESB's proposals for the cost and competitiveness review?  In view of the size of the market that will now be opened up to outside generators of electricity to sell electricity to our large consumers, does the Minister consider that the cost and competitiveness review might prove insufficient to ensure that the ESB will be capable of meeting the level of competition it will now have to face? \n Mr. Lowry  It is difficult to anticipate the outcome of the last Energy Council  meeting under the Presidency of the Italians. There is a huge difference between the stance taken by the majority of countries and that taken, for instance, by the Italians, the French and ourselves.  I have already said we envisage a 25 per cent opening, but I cannot say that it can be held at that.  There is a huge lobby within the European Union at the moment to liberalise the market to an even greater extent. Obviously, we have put forward the Irish position in a vociferous and forceful way.  We have a very small system and there are peculiarities which are unique to it.  We have put that view forward.  In respect of implementing this change when it arises, as recently as late last week I had a meeting with the chairman and chief executive of the ESB.  We have gone through the proposals in detail and have discussed the likely outcome. Arising from those discussions I am quite confident the management of the ESB has the necessary professionalism and skill to ensure that the CCR will put the company in a position to be able to take on whatever degree of competition comes in.  As of now, it is envisaged that will be anything between 25 and 40 per cent.  The Irish position is that it should be gradual and that we should approach it in a prudent fashion. In the negotiations we will attempt to limit it, as near as possible, to 25 per cent. \n Mr. Molloy  The Minister will recall that when the cost and competitiveness review was originally published it was intended to achieve a reduction of 3,000 in the numbers employed in the ESB and savings of £100 million.  None of these target figures was achieved.  The figure for job savings is estimated now at 2,000 and the saving in annual costs is approximately £60 million.  My question has not been answered.  When the cost and competitiveness review was being drawn up, what percentage of the electricity market was it envisaged would be opened up to competition?  Obviously, from what the Minister has said, 1994  brought about a change in the percentage of the market liable to be opened up to competition.  Prior to 1994 the expectation at departmental and ESB level must have been much lower than the current minimum estimate of 25 per cent; it could be as high as 40 per cent. What percentage of the market was expected to be opened up at the time the cost and competitiveness review was being decided upon? \n Mr. Lowry  The CCR was not formulated at the time of the opening up of the electricity market.  As the Deputy is aware, we engaged in the CCR—— \n Mr. Molloy  It was to prepare the company for competition. \n Mr. Lowry  ——arising from the independent consultant's report which established that the cost base of the company was running in the region of £100 million per annum in excess of what it should be.  Following prolonged discussions, agreement was reached on the CCR which reduces the cost base by £58 million per annum.  When the CCR is fully implemented, the company will be in a position to compete in a competitive environment, which liberalisation of the market will inevitably mean for the ESB.  I am satisfied the ESB is fully aware that it is crucial for the company to implement the CCR in full, ensure there is downward pressure on an ongoing basis on its cost base and reduce its overheads. \n Mr. Molloy  Will the Minister give an assurance to the House that the ESB will not resort to increasing electricity prices to domestic consumers to compensate for its lack of competitiveness because of its failure to achieve the original targets in the cost and competitiveness review? \n Mr. Lowry  Not only can I give that assurance but I have already raised this matter with the company and it has  been made clear that under no circumstance will consumers in Ireland be asked to pay for inefficiencies or deficiencies in the company.  The overrun on cost base cannot be allowed to be passed on to householders. \n Mr. S. Brennan  The Minister may wish to qualify the answer he has just given because I understand the CCR documentation, which the Minister stood over, contains the phrase \"necessary rebalancing in prices will take place\".  Does that mean that if the market opens up and competition is introduced, price increases will transfer from large industry to the ordinary consumer? An evening newspaper yesterday carried the story that we are facing an increase in prices of approximately one-third in the next few years.  Perhaps the Minister might rethink the answer he gave to Deputy Molloy based on his commitment to the CCR process of rebalancing the charges.  I understand that to mean that the rebalancing will be away from large industry in the competitive area to the consumer because the Minister will have to get the money from somewhere. \n Mr. Lowry  The implementation of the CCR package that has been brought forward and agreed is cost effective.  It will pay for itself over a four and a half year period and will thereafter result in significant savings to the cost base of the company.

        "answerText": " Mr. Yates  I propose to take Questions Nos. 6, 7, 27, 39, 43 and 98 together.  These questions deal with the BSE crisis.  I have made a number of personal interventions in respect of rendering, intervention, compensation and so on.  I would like to focus on the market aspects of this in terms of third countries. While I am pleased that a number of third countries, Egypt, Kuwait, Lebanon and South Africa, have lifted the restrictions on Irish beef, it is a matter  of concern that some important markets, in particular Iran and Libya, continue to restrict to our product.  The issues raised by the recent developments on BSE are primarily technical, which are not amenable to instant political solutions.  My Department, the diplomatic service and An Bord Bia is continuing to address the issues and concerns as they have arisen and has gone to considerable lengths to reassure the relevant authorities of the safety of Irish beef and beef products.  Strong emphasis is also being placed on the image of Ireland as a source of clean, green and superior quality food and there is extensive contact and co-ordination between the different Departments and agencies involved.  However, BSE is a very complex issue and it will take time before the problem is resolved in some cases.  The task has been made more difficult by sensational media reports which are very difficult to counter.  Political interventions have and will continue to be made where required.  As the House is aware, the personal intervention of the Taoiseach was a critical factor in the re-opening of the Egyptian market while political initiatives were also important in lifting the Lebanese restrictions.  I will visit Russia, a very important outlet for Irish beef next week.  I propose to visit Libya as soon as the necessary arrangements can be made.  While I am disappointed that such a visit has not taken place before now, it is important to ensure that the timing and the circumstances are right so that the optimum outcome will be obtained from the visit.  The Iranian authorities have agreed to send a veterinary delegation to Ireland to discuss technical issues and arrangements are being made to agree an early date for the visit.  I have had contacts with Mr. Foorozesh, the Minister of the Construction Crusade and I am in regular contact with the Iranian Ambassador.  The need for further  action, including political initiatives, will be reviewed following this visit.  I can assure the House that I am fully aware of the importance of ensuring access of Irish cattle and beef to all third country markets.  The situation is under constant review and all appropriate action will be taken. \n Mr. O'Malley  On the various interventions other than on the question of marketing in third countries, will the Minister outline the position with regard to rendering?  We were told four or five weeks ago that rendering was absolutely essential and the slaughtering and processing industry would have to close down if renderers could not stay open.  A Supplementary Estimate was passed here for £2.5 million to keep renderers open until 21 May.  The Minister said after that time they would get no money and would have to stay open under their own steam.  The deadline of 21 May, the day many things happened, has passed and the money has been spent.  What is the present position?  If the subsidy is not required after 21 May, why was it required before then? \n Mr. Yates  I will outline the up-to-date position as I understand it.  Discussions are ongoing between processors and renderers.  In many cases a substantial volume of the rendering capacity is owned by meat processors, subsidiaries or sister companies of processors, and it is in their hands to find a solution.  It was necessary to have a breathing space of State support for the ongoing rendering of offal to meat, bonemeal and tallow.  That window of opportunity has resulted in a reduction in stocks from 10,000 tonnes to 4,000 tonnes during that timeframe, with one individual operator taking 2,200 tonnes. Not all renderers claimed aid, but the claims on hand indicate that slightly less than the £2.5 million will be paid in storage and production subsidies.  I understand renderers have agreed to operate for two weeks without subsidy to allow the negotiations to conclude.  In the order of 200,000 animals have  been processed since Easter in meat factories and the subsidy is, therefore, justified. I made it absolutely clear publicily on Friday, and I take this opportunity to do so again, that there will not be an ongoing State subsidy for this purpose. Other countries in similar circumstances do not provide ongoing subsidies.  While I could make a case to the Cabinet for an emergency subvention for a short period to allow the meat and bonemeal trade to restore order, export contracts are moving again and I do not believe a subsidy would be justified. \n Mr. O'Malley  Do I understand the Minister correctly to say that Iran and Libya are the only third country markets still closed to us because of the BSE problem and, if so, does that suggest the problem is a minor one since there are 100 or more third countries, a large number of which are potential customers for beef?  Apart from the two markets still closed, is it the case that the others are buying much smaller quantities of beef because of a general lack of confidence in European beef? \n Mr. Yates  Many markets other than the two mentioned are closed to Irish beef, but in terms of third country markets, for the live trade the three potentially significant markets for Europe, including Ireland, are Egypt, Libya and Turkey.  The Turkish market was reopened, but since there was a problem with tariffs and so on we did not make a commercial breakthrough there.  In terms of beef, the key markets are Russia, Egypt, Iran and Saudi Arabia.  The reason I focused on the two markets still closed is that they are volume markets. Countries such as South America are closed to us, but even if they were reopened they are not of significance. Consumption is down everywhere.  Even though the Libyan market is not open to us, the number of animals processed there is greatly diminished. \n Mr. Cowen  Will the Minister confirm that consumption is down 30 per cent in the UK, 40 per cent in France and 50  per cent in Germany; that Libya remains closed to us even though they had ordered 140,000 cattle; that 50,000 cattle and 500,000 sheep were recently exported to Australia; that the Gulf states are closed to us and that even though the Egyptian market is open — we heard much about the phone call on the open market in Egypt — there are no buyers in Egypt?  Will he confirm that the position is drastic at present?  The Minister will recall that when a Fianna Fáil delegation visited Iran a spokesperson for the Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry stated that there were only minor, technical problems, that the market would be reopened in a couple of days or a week at most and that the Fianna Fáil trip was unnecessary.  In view of that statement will he explain what sudden difficulties have arisen in reopening that market? \n Mr. Yates  The consumption pattern in Europe is more or less as the Deputy indicated — perhaps his figures are slightly on the large side but I would not quibble with them.  The figure he gave for Libya is incorrect, it should be 160,000 animals.  The majority of markets in the Gulf states are open.  I do not know what the Deputy's experience of the Iranians has been, but my experience has not been good. \n Mr. Cowen  They told me that. \n Mr. Yates  When the Fianna Fáil delegation came home from Iran it announced there was no problem with shipments to Iran and that they would be unloaded. \n Mr. Cowen  They have been unloaded. \n Mr. Yates  Today, however, I met the two principal exporters who told me they still have not been paid and there is no prospect of their being paid. \n Mr. Cowen  What veterinary technical difficulties remain outstanding to reopening that market? \n Mr. Yates  I have had personal conversations with Minister Foorozesh who gave me assurances that if certain action was taken, commitments would be honoured. None of those commitments have been honoured.  I am very anxious to resolve the Iranian problem.  There is a problem in that Ireland, as well as France and other member states, was in the process of servicing a contract for an excess of 16,000 tonnes of Irish beef which has been supplied in good faith and for which an arbitary date, 5 March, has been fixed.  The product is not in free circulation, in many cases payment has not been made and the companies involved are experiencing severe cash flow difficulties.  There are also stocks here that never departed for Iran which have not been honoured in terms of contracts, there is an unfulfilled element of the contract and the overall ban remains in place.  I have offered to go to Teheran to negotiate on these issues and I was assured this was not a political issue but a technical one.  Letters have been exchanged in recent weeks and a meeting is due to take place this week between my senior veterinary officer at the OIE meeting in Paris and Dr. Montulabi, the head of the Iranian veterinary delegation.  For three weeks I have been trying to agree a date for a visit by the Iranian technical delegation, notwithstanding the fact that Iranian veterinarians have already visited the Border. I will do anything the Iranian authorities want to provide them with the necessary knowledge to lift the four aspects of the ban to which I have referred.  This is a serious problem and I am determined to do whatever is necessary to resolve it. \n An Leas-Cheann Comhairle  As we are some minutes past our time may I suggest that each Deputy put a brief question to the Minister and, perhaps, the Minister will agree to a single reply? Brevity is paramount. \n Mr. T. Foxe  Since Russia is such an important market, why is the Minister delaying his visit for six weeks? \n Mr. H. Byrne  Will the Minister accept that the crisis in the beef industry is affecting the Irish economy more than others?  Will he accept also that he has now handed the initiative to Britain which seems to have the greatest control in this regard?  How many cattle have been exported in the past month and what Third World countries has the Minister visited in the past month? \n Mr. Leonard  Is the Minister aware of the difficulty currently being experienced by farmers in getting both culled and fat cows to meat factories at a reduced price?  The fear is that more serious difficulties will be experienced shortly. \n Mr. Nolan  Is the Minister aware of the proposals by some renderers to dispose of offal in landfill sites?  What are his concerns from an environmental point of view in this regard? \n Mr. B. Smith  Will the Minister give me a categorical commitment that further State assistance will be given to the rendering industry to enable it survive if the current crisis in the beef industry continues? \n Mr. Ellis  Will the Minister outline his plans to prevent chaos in the second half of the year with regard to livestock for which there will be no market in view of his statement last week, which terrorised farmers, that there was no future in this regard? \n Mr. Yates  That is quite a range of general knowledge questions but I will try to deal with them as briefly as possible. I want to make it clear I will not be providing any further support for the rendering industry and it is important that people are not under any illusion in that regard.  There are no circumstances in which I will be providing further aid. \n Mr. Cowen  What will be the size of the levy? \n Mr. Yates  I will not be introducing a  levy.  I am opposed to a statutory levy and I made that clear also. \n Mr. Cowen  But there will be a nonstatutory levy. \n An Leas-Cheann Comhairle  Let us hear the reply. \n Mr. Yates  There will not be a levy. I am endeavouring to answer as many questions as possible.  I did not delay my visit to Russia. Some stability was needed and Dr. Zakharov, the top Russian veterinarian, has been in Ireland and I met him a number of times.  I am going to Russia to attend a major food fair in St. Petersberg and I am using that opportunity — if it ain't broke, don't fix it — to work with our partners there as opposed to highlighting concerns about British or Irish beef.  Russia has a state purchasing mechanism; Moscow is the largest buyer of beef in the world.  The timing of my visit has to do with the fact that there is currently an election in Russia. \n Mr. H. Byrne  The beef industry is not broken, it is in bits. \n Mr. Yates  I do not know the point the Deputy is making about Britain other than to say that however bad the situation—— \n Mr. H. Byrne  The Minister failed for three days—— \n An Leas-Cheann Comhairle  Please, Deputy Byrne, we are many minutes past the allocated time.  If this continues we will have to conclude the business. \n Mr. Yates  The price of heifer meat in Britain today is 80p per pound; the Deputy should check the price here. Many prime quality two-and-a-half year old 13 cwt bullocks in Northern Ireland and Britain should be going to meat factories today but instead they are being thrown in a skip and burned.  Britain's long-term problems are so serious that the European problem will not be  solved until the British problem is solved. \n Mr. H. Byrne  Talk to me about Irish farmers. \n Mr. Yates  On the question of culled cows and the prospects for—— \n Mr. H. Byrne  How many cattle were exported last month? \n An Leas-Cheann Comhairle  Please, Deputy Byrne, other Deputies' questions are being addressed. \n Mr. Yates  In relation to all of these issues I have a number of standard instruments with which to improve the marketability of Irish beef now and in the autumn.  These include intervention, which we have discussed; an increase in refunds, which will make meat and live cattle from Europe cheaper in Egypt, Russia and other countries; direct compensation, which is important; direct promotion as well as the diplomatic offensive. \n Mr. H. Byrne  The Minister does not have any answers. \n Mr. Yates  I hope to finalise shortly a multi-million pound package with the food board.  We are requesting Brussels to remove restrictions in relation to the grades and carcasses of animals that can be promoted so that we can make a sustained effort, between the national promotional agencies and the Commission, to promote the consumption of beef. These problems will not be solved overnight. The recovery will be slow but the Government will be giving them the absolute priority they deserve. \n An Leas-Cheann Comhairle  That concludes questions for today. ",

        "showAs": " 54 Mr. M. McDowell asked the Minister for Tourism and Trade the current position regarding the proposed national conference centre.\n      [10267/96] ",
        "answerText": " Mr. O'Sullivan  I propose to take Questions Nos. 8, 10, 35, 37 and 54 together.  It remains the objective of the Minister that work commences on the site of the proposed national conference centre by the end of the year.  The achievement of that objective, however, depends on a number of factors, including, whether a viable proposal acceptable to the Government finally emerges from current negotiations and the position to be taken by the European Commission whose formal approval is required for the associated European Regional Development Fund grant.  Following the termination of the open tendering competition late last year, the Minister asked Bord Fáilte to pursue an earlier proposal from the RDS to develop, in its Ballsbridge site, without generating voluntary society, a national conference centre for up to 2,000 delegates at its Ballsbridge site, without any annual operating subsidy.  That assessment process is now nearing finalisation and should be complete within the next few weeks.  As the Deputy can appreciate it is important that a project of this scale and complexity is properly planned and adequately assessed.  I am not aware of any formal legal action pending in relation to the open tendering competition which took place last year.  The Minister had a meeting some months ago with representatives of SONAS, at its request, at which it gave a presentation of its proposals to develop a complex at the Phoenix Park racecourse. \n Mr. Andrews  The Minister of State's reply appears to indicate that the building of the conference centre will not commence by the end of the year, but I understood from his ministerial colleague, Deputy Kenny, that it would be up and running sometime after the end of this year.  Now we are told there is a delay.  Regarding the SONAS application to build a casino, will the Minister of State indicate if the Government is for or  against that project in the light of planning permission granted for the development on the site of the former Phoenix Park racecourse?  Will the Government introduce legislation to provide for a casino?  Will the Minister amend the gaming and lotteries laws? Will the Minister of State indicate the direction the Government is going in this area? \n Mr. O'Sullivan  The issue of amending the gaming and lotteries laws is a separate question.  I am informed that no decision has been taken on the SONAS proposal.  The proposal for the RDS is under consideration and discussions on the funding of the project are taking place in Brussels.  Regarding the commencement of work on the proposed national conference centre, I refer the Deputy to my reply where I stated that it remains the Minister's objective that work will commence on the site by the end of the year. That is still the objective. \n Mr. Andrews  Is that not a farce and a nightmare?  Given what the Minister of State said and what his senior Minister said, is it not the case that the conference centre will cause great difficulty for the Government?  The suggestion that the construction of the centre will commence by the end of the year might be a good election issue.  As in the case of 1916, people will ask what the coalition did about the conference centre. The proposed conference centre is to be sited in the middle of one of the most traffic congested areas in Dublin.  We have a relevant proposition in that regard to which the Minister of State might respond.  If the SONAS development in the Phoenix Park becomes a reality, an outstanding conference centre will be located there.  If the proposed conference centre in the RDS also proceeds, there will be a surplus of conference centres.  I suggest that the SONAS development might be a considerably better conference centre than the one proposed in the RDS. \n An Ceann Comhairle  The Deputy is entering into a debate and deviating from the subject matter. \n Mr. Andrews  I do not intend to do that.  I want a conference centre for Dublin and Ireland because we badly need one, but in the meantime the Minister of State is laying down political landmines by giving the type of responses he has given this afternoon. \n Mr. O'Sullivan  I am sure everybody in the House would share the Deputy's enthusiasm for a national conference centre.  The matter is under serious consideration and planning applications have been lodged.  Discussions concerning the proposed site at the RDS are ongoing in Brussels.  I cannot give the Deputy any information on the future of the SONAS proposal.  We will have to await the outcome of consideration of the RDS proposal to ascertain if it will be acceptable to the Commission. ",
