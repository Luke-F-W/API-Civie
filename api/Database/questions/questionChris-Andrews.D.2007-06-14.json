        "answerText": " Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment  As the Deputy will be aware, trade policy is a competence of the European Commission under Article 207 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, and referred to as the Common Commercial Policy.  The EU and Morocco established a Free Trade Area as part of the EU-Morocco Association Agreement, signed in 1996, which entered into force on 1 March 2000. The EU and Morocco also signed an Agreement on additional liberalisation of trade in agricultural products, processed agricultural products, and fish and fisheries products, which entered into force in October 2012.  Both parties agreed upon a protocol establishing a Dispute Settlement Mechanism, which entered into force in 2012. Negotiations for a Deep and Comprehensive Free Trade Area (DCFTA) started in 2013. The last negotiating round was held in April 2014.  The EU-Morocco Sustainable Fisheries Partnership Agreement (FPA), concluded in March 2019, allocates fishing opportunities for the EU in exchange for an overall financial contribution of €208 million. A substantial part of this contribution is used to promote the sustainable development of the fisheries economy in Morocco and the Western Sahara.  In 2021, under the EU Trade Policy Review, the EU has offered to discuss modernising trade and investment relations with Morocco, to better adapt them to today’s challenges, notably in respect of value chains and the greening and digitalisation of respective economies.  In the judgments of the Court of Justice of the European Union in Joined Cases C-778/21 P and C-798/21 P and in Joined Cases C-779/21 P and C-799/21 P, delivered on 4 October, the question of the territorial applicability of certain EU-Morocco agreements was considered by the Court. In its judgment, the Court upheld the annulment of the EU’s approval of agriculture and fisheries agreements with the Kingdom of Morocco. The basis for the Court’s decision was that the implementation of an international agreement between the European Union and Morocco in the territory of Western Sahara, as provided for by the agreements at issue, must receive the consent of the people of Western Sahara; however, the Court determined that such consent has not been given in this instance. In the Court’s judgment in case C-399/22, also delivered on 4 October, the Court took a restrictive approach to interpreting the scope for unilateral Member State restrictions on trade, indicating that permissible exceptions to the EU’s Common Commercial Policy are limited. Ireland will, together with our EU partners, give careful consideration to the Court’s rulings.  Ireland’s long-held position is that Western Sahara is a non-self-governing territory. We support the United Nations Security Council Resolutions, which support the right to self-determination of the people of Western Sahara. "

Transition Year has a unique and important value in the life of students.  The management authority of each school carries responsibility for making decisions regarding the Transition Year programme in that school. Each school designs its own Transition Year programme, within set guidelines, to suit the needs and interests of its students. In establishing its own distinctive programme content, the school takes into account the possibilities offered by local community interests.  There is no specific funding source for schools aimed at a student's participation in a specific programme at Transition Year. A Transition Year grant is paid on a per capita basis, at a rate of €95 per annum per student.  The Department of Tourism, Culture, Arts, Gaeltacht, Sport and Media has advised my Department that Sport Ireland is the statutory body with responsibility for the development of sport, increasing participation at all levels, and raising standards, including the allocation of funding across its various programmes. Sport Ireland channels funding through the relevant National Governing Body of sport. Funding for football is allocated to the Football Association of Ireland (FAI). It has also advised that students are recommended to engage with the FAI to discuss their individual needs and how they may be supported by the governing body. ",

To this end, they have engaged with a number of relevant public bodies and representative organisations in an effort to determine how best to support persons with long-term incontinence with respect to the disposal of medical incontinence wear.  DECC have further advised that they are currently working with the National Waste Collection Permit Office to carry out a study on incentivised charging structures in the waste collection market. This study will examine what, if any, improvements are needed to ensure that waste collection systems are fully incentivising waste prevention and improved source segregation practices. The study will also consider methods to support households disposing of medical incontinence products.  I would also note that section 477 Taxes Consolidation Act 1997 previously provided for tax relief at the standard rate of income tax for any service charges paid in full and on time in respect of a supply of water for domestic purposes, domestic refuse collection or disposal, or domestic sewage disposal facilities. However, in line with a recommendation of the Commission on Taxation in 2009, Finance Act 2010 provided for the abolition of that relief, effective from the tax year 2012 in respect of service charges paid in the financial year 2011 and subsequent financial years.

No. 491/2024 - Control of Dogs (XL Bully) Regulations 2024 that banned XL Bully type dogs came into force in two stages beginning on the 1st October 2024, with a full ownership ban coming into force on the 1st February 2025.  The ban is being brought in over two stages to give XL Bully type dog owners who wish to keep their XL Bully type dog the time to obtain a 'Certificate of Exemption'. There will be a four month period between the 1st October 2024 and before 1st February 2025, where these owners will be able to apply for a 'Certificate of Exemption'.  The images of the dogs referred to by the Deputy are contained in the “Guidance: Applying the XL Bully type physical conformation standard” published on gov.ie/xlbully and were provided by the Irish Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (I.S.P.C.A), and confirmed to be XL Bully type dogs in their care. The images published are indicative of what an XL Bully type dog looks like. A dog does not have to look exactly like the images provided to conform to the standard. I have requested my officials to source additional images to include in the physical conformation standard published on gov.ie/xlbully, to assist XL Bully owners to determine if their dog is an XL Bully type. Any further images that will supplement the Physical Conformation Standard will be published once available.  From the 1st February 2025, all owners of XL Bully type dogs must have a 'Certificate of Exemption', or proof of application for the 'Certificate of Exemption', for each dog.  All XL Bully type dog owners will be required to licence, microchip and neuter their dogs. Further information on the XL Bully type dog ban, including the criteria to qualify and the documentation to be included with their application for a 'Certificate of Exemption' is available on gov.ie/xlbully.  The regulations define an XL Bully type dog as “a dog which substantially meets the physical conformation standard specified in Schedule 1 and, in the case of an XL Bully which has not attained the age of 18 months, has the potential to do so on or after attaining that age.”  Owners should use the Physical Conformation Standard to determine if their dog is an XL Bully type dog. It is the owner’s responsibility to determine if their dog is covered by the ban. If owners think their dog could be an XL Bully type dog, they should comply with all new requirements. This includes puppies that have the potential to become an XL Bully type dog.

The regulations will be enforced within the framework of the primary legislation - in this case, the Control of Dogs Act 1986 and 2014. In this context, local authorities, through the Dog Warden Service will be responsible for enforcement.  Along with my colleagues Minister O'Brien and Minister Dillon, I recently announced additional resources for the Dog Warden services from 2025. The funding recognises the increased demands in the area of dog control and the need to ensure resources on the ground to enforce the pending ban on XL Bully type dogs.  My Department also has policy responsibility for the Dog Breeding Establishments Act 2010. The Act provides a regulatory framework for the licensing, monitoring and inspection of dog breeding establishments by Local Authorities and, where a serious and immediate threat exists to public health or animal health and welfare, for the closure of such establishments.

Over 80% of charging is expected to happen at home.  Available grants, administered by SEAI and funded by ZEVI, include the Home Charger Grant Scheme – up to €300 – for homeowners, and the Apartment Charger Grant which assists residents and owners of apartments and multi-unit developments install an EV charger.  Approved Housing Bodies (AHB) are eligible to apply for the apartment scheme with access of up to 90% funding.  If the residences within an AHB location meet the terms and conditions of the home charger grant scheme, they are also eligible to apply.

A fundamental component of this provision is the availability of nursing staff in all closed prisons on a 24 hour basis each day of the year. Nurses are the largest cohort of professional health providers in most healthcare settings and this is replicated in the Irish Prison Service.  People in custody have access to nurses at all times, and following an assessment Irish Prison Service Nurses commence a treatment pathway or refer individuals to the most appropriate professional colleague. Whilst specialist interventions are required in some cases, primary care nurses are often in the position to assist in the immediate symptomatic relief of a clinical presentation with swift follow up from the Prison GP or other specialist as soon as possible. The engagement pathway for addictions in the Irish Prison Service is rapid and functional and the Irish Prison Service is currently developing plans to establish an enhanced specialist clinical pathway available more rapidly in the future.  The Irish Prison Service have advised that the specific information requested by the Deputy cannot be provided for security and operational reasons. ",

        "answerText": " Minister for Justice  I propose to take Questions Nos. 157 and 165 together.  I can advise the Deputy that the Irish Prison Service employs nurses across the prison estate to provide primary care to the prison population and work as part of the prison healthcare team.  The Irish Prison Service does not currently employ full-time Addiction Nurses. There are, however, a number of primary care nurses who are assigned the function of carrying out specialist addiction assessments when this is feasible taking account of the operational demands of the prison.  As the Deputy may be aware, the Irish Prison Service engages Merchants Quay Ireland (MQI) to provide a prison-based addiction counselling service across the entire Irish Prison Service estate (with the exception of Arbour Hill Prison and the Training Unit where the clinical need is currently under review).  The MQI service provides a range of counselling and intervention skills related to substance misuse and dependency. These skills include motivational interviewing and enhancement therapy, a twelve step facilitation programme, cognitive behavioural therapy and harm reduction approaches and people in custody are offered one to one counselling and group work interventions.  Furthermore, the Deputy may wish to know that the Irish Prison Service has recently employed a national lead to oversee the provision of Mental Health and Addiction in Irish prisons.  I can also advise the Deputy that preventing access to contraband into prisons continues to be a high priority for the Irish Prison Service. The prison environment mirrors the same range of activity and challenges arising in many communities grappling with the scourge of harmful drug use. A significantly high proportion of prisoners, approximately 80%, are committed to custody with addiction issues. The Irish Prison Service published a new Drugs Strategy on 29 November 2023, setting out clear measures to be taken by the Prison Service to tackle the problem of illicit drug use over the next three years.

The marketing strategy reflected the short-term need to both retain GB business and gain more EU visitors and, in parallel, to help to drive greater market diversification. Tourism Ireland undertook a comprehensive programme of marketing activity throughout 2023, targeting both Great Britain and key European markets.  As outlined by the Minister for Public Expenditure, National Development Plan Delivery and Reform in PQ 233 on September 18 this year, the exact composition of Ireland's BAR claim will not be finalised until the claim is submitted to the EU Commission. Once this is finalised, it will be possible to confirm detail in relation to individual projects and final amounts.  Notwithstanding that, the actions taken by Tourism Ireland supported the tourism economy by enabling it to remain competitive in response to Brexit, protect jobs in the sector, support exposed regions and diversify markets after Brexit.  Activity programs were implemented under the following headings:     Campaign Theme    Activities      Campaign focus for visitors from GB    Publicity; Consumer Advertising Campaigns; Work with B2B tour operator partners      Campaign focus for visitors from Mainland Europe    Publicity; Consumer Advertising Campaigns; Work with B2B tour operator partners      Supporting the Irish tourism industry most impacted by Brexit    Fairs, workshops and events    ",

        "answerText": " Minister of State at the Department of Education  Enabling children with special educational needs to receive an education is a priority for this government. It is also a key priority for my department and for the National Council for Special Education (NCSE).  The vast majority of children with special educational needs are supported to attend mainstream classes with their peers. Where children with more complex needs require additional supports, special classes and special school places are provided. Over 400 new special classes have been sanctioned by the NCSE for the 2024/25 school year meaning there is now over 3,300 special classes nationwide.  The NCSE has advised that they are aware of future need for special classes in the area and will visit schools with the potential to expand over the course of the school year. Engagement with all schools with available capacity will form the planning process for the 2025/26 school year and beyond.  While it may not be possible to expand accommodation in all schools due to site restrictions, in such cases schools with students enrolled with special educational needs are provided additional supports such as special need assistants (SNAs). The NCSE can also arrange tailored visits from their special educational needs advisors if required.  For the 2024/25 school year one new special class has been sanctioned in the area and resources have been allocated, in addition, there are a number of places in a local primary school for students seeking enrolment into second class or above. The NCSE is confident that through the provision of these classes and vacancies in existing classes there is sufficient places to meet the needs of all children known to them for the 2024/25 school year.  Parents seeking special class placements for their children are advised to the NCSE locally so that their needs can be taken into account for planning purposes. The local special educational needs organisers (SENOs) remain available to assist and advise parents of children with special educational needs. Parents may contact SENOs directly using the contact details available on the NCSE’s website.  The department will continue to support the NCSE and schools through the provision of the necessary funding and capital investment to ensure all children are successful in accessing an education. ",

The project has been devolved for delivery to the school authority.  I can confirm that this project received my departments approval to go to planning in Q1 of 2024 and the department awaits a post planning (developed design) report from the school for review.

        "answerText": " Minister for Public Expenditure, National Development Plan Delivery and Reform  I propose to take Questions Nos. 469, 477, 478 and 479 together.  As a consequence of the UK’s decision to leave the EU, the EU put in place funding support for Member States to mitigate the resulting impacts, in the form of a Brexit Adjustment Reserve (BAR). The BAR provides support to counter the adverse economic, social, territorial and, environmental consequences of the withdrawal of the UK from the European Union.  The BAR Regulation was formally adopted by the Council and Parliament in September and entered into force on 11 October 2021. Ireland’s BAR allocation is €802 million, the largest allocation for any Member State. Ireland has received its share in the form of pre-financing - approximately €361.7m for 2021, €276.7m in 2022, and €163.7m in 2023.  In order to be eligible for BAR funding, expenditure must fall within the BAR eligibility period for expenditure that runs from the 1st of January 2020 to the 31st of December 2023. Member states are required to submit their final claim to the Commission by end September 2024. The application for BAR funding must set out the negative impacts of the withdrawal of the UK from the European Union and how the measures carried out under the Fund alleviate the adverse consequences.  There is no proposal for a new mechanism to extend or replace the BAR.  Following the BAR Regulation coming into force in October 2021, the Government allocated specific funding of €389 million in Budgets 2022 and 2023 across a number of sectors. Further to this, officials in my Department have engaged in a review exercise of Brexit related spending outside of that allocated in Budgets 2022 and 2023 which may qualify for inclusion in Ireland’s BAR claim. As a result, a total figure of approximately €900 million in Brexit spending has been identified for inclusion in Ireland's BAR claim.  The exact composition of Ireland's BAR claim will not be finalised until the claim is submitted to the EU Commission in September 2024. On that basis, as work is ongoing to finalise all Brexit-related spending to be included in the BAR claim, it is not possible at this time to confirm individual projects or final amounts of expenditure that will be included in the BAR claim.  That being said, the BAR fund has enabled the Government to make investments across a range of sectors to mitigate Brexit impact. These include for example: enterprise supports, measures to support fisheries and coastal communities, targeted supports for the agri-food sector, and checks and controls at Dublin Port and Rosslare Europort.  From this total BAR allocation received by Ireland, significant funding has been allocated to the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine. This funding was allocated across the Department’s areas of responsibility, with a large proportion going to Fisheries and Aquaculture initiatives. Significant funding was also provided to increase operations in ports and address the customs implications of Brexit, including through funding provided for upgrade works in Rosslare port. ",

I am advised that the Brexit Adjustment Reserve (BAR) funding for tourism relates to 2023 only, when €7.75 million was allocated to Tourism Ireland.  The funding was used to put in place a marketing strategy to stem and reverse the decline in tourist numbers and associated revenues from Great Britain and Northern Ireland, as a result of the adverse impact of Brexit on Irish tourism.  The intention was also to support growth in other markets. Tourism Ireland undertook a comprehensive programme of marketing activity throughout 2023, targeting both Great Britain and key European markets.  As outlined by the Minister for Public Expenditure, National Development Plan Delivery and Reform in PQ 114 of February this year, the exact composition of Ireland's BAR claim will not be finalised until the claim is submitted in September 2024. Work continues by his Department to verify all Brexit-related spending for inclusion in the BAR claim and as such it is not possible at this time to confirm individual projects or final amounts of expenditure in any sector that will be included in the BAR claim.  Tourism Ireland's actions in relation to this matter supported the tourism economy by enabling it to remain competitive in response to Brexit, protect jobs in the sector, support exposed regions and diversify markets after Brexit.  Activity programs were implemented under the following headings.     Campaign Theme    Activities      Campaign focus for visitors from GB    Publicity; Consumer Advertising Campaigns; Work with B2B tour operator partners      Campaign focus for visitors from Mainland Europe    Publicity; Consumer Advertising Campaigns; Work with B2B tour operator partners      Supporting the Irish tourism industry most impacted by Brexit    Fairs, workshops and events    ",

        "answerText": " Minister for Tourism, Culture, Arts, Gaeltacht, Sport and Media  I propose to take Questions Nos. 920 and 970 together.  I am advised that the Brexit Adjustment Reserve (BAR) funding for tourism relates to 2023 only, when €7.75 million was allocated to Tourism Ireland.  The funding was used to put in place a marketing strategy to stem and reverse the decline in tourist numbers and associated revenues from Great Britain and Northern Ireland, as a result of the adverse impact of Brexit on Irish tourism.  The intention was also to support growth in other markets. Tourism Ireland undertook a comprehensive programme of marketing activity throughout 2023, targeting both Great Britain and key European markets.  As outlined by the Minister for Public Expenditure, National Development Plan Delivery and Reform in PQ 114 of February this year, the exact composition of Ireland's BAR claim will not be finalised until the claim is submitted in September 2024. Work continues by his Department to verify all Brexit-related spending for inclusion in the BAR claim and as such it is not possible at this time to confirm individual projects or final amounts of expenditure in any sector that will be included in the BAR claim.  Tourism Ireland's actions in relation to this matter supported the tourism economy by enabling it to remain competitive in response to Brexit, protect jobs in the sector, support exposed regions and diversify markets after Brexit.  Activity programs were implemented under the following headings.     Campaign Theme    Activities      Campaign focus for visitors from GB    Publicity; Consumer Advertising Campaigns; Work with B2B tour operator partners      Campaign focus for visitors from Mainland Europe    Publicity; Consumer Advertising Campaigns; Work with B2B tour operator partners      Supporting the Irish tourism industry most impacted by Brexit    Fairs, workshops and events    ",

Waterways Ireland is the freehold owner of a triangular piece of property known as City Block 19 in Dublin’s docklands. It comprises 1.2 hectares (2.965 acres) of mainly disused land and is located at the confluence of the River Dodder, the River Liffey and Grand Canal Dock.  The site is situated within the North Lotts & Grand Canal Dock Strategic Development Zone (SDZ).

This protection will continue in place into the future and will inform any development plan for the site as a whole.  Waterways Ireland is cognisant of the cultural importance of the site, and the requirements and objectives of the SDZ Planning Scheme, which include examining the “feasibility of re-opening one of the infilled graving docks to be included in any development proposals”. This objective mandates a sensitive and pragmatic approach to the preservation of the cultural heritage of the site, that is capable of securing the residential, commercial, community and cultural objectives for Block 19 as set out in the Planning Scheme.  Waterways Ireland has engaged with the Land Development Agency who confirmed it does not wish to acquire the land in question. Any future plans for the site will be determined in accordance with the necessary planning and development requirements, and will be cognisant of the history, cultural significance and community benefit that the site can bring to the community and the wider area.

Any queries in relation to accommodation and related services provided to international protection applicants are the responsibility of the International Protection Accommodation Service (IPAS) of the Department of Children, Equality, Disability and Integration. They can be contacted at ipasinbox@equality.gov.ie.  IPAS staff are present in the IPO reception and engage with applicants at the point of initial application. The Department understands that IPAS record those persons it has not yet been able to accommodate and provide a range of supports to take account of these circumstances.

It is open to higher education institutions that operate on a 'for profit' basis to use their own resources to provide financial supports to any of their students that they consider to be in particular need.  I would advise any student to make direct contact with the institution that they plan to attend to consider what supports may be available.  Regarding other supports that may be available to third level students outside the Student Grant Scheme, the below information may be of use:  • The Higher Education Authority (HEA)  provides information in relation to bursaries and scholarships available at the following link: hea.ie/funding-governance-performance/funding/student-finance/other-finance-bursaries-scholarships/.  • Tax relief at the standard rate of tax may be available in respect of tuition fees paid for approved courses at approved colleges of higher education. More information on the tax credit and the tax treatment of students generally is available from the Revenue Commissioners at www.revenue.ie/en/life-events-and-personal-circumstances/students/index.aspx  or from your local Tax Office;  • The Rent Tax Credit is also increasing to €750 per individual and €1,500 per jointly assessed couple for 2024 and 2025. Payments made by parents in respect of “digs” or rent-a-room arrangements for their children to attend an approved course will now qualify for the Rent Tax Credit, provided the claimant and their child are not related to the landlord. This change will apply retrospectively for the years 2022 and 2023. More information on the rent tax credit is available on www.revenue.ie/en/personal-tax-credits-reliefs-and-exemptions/land-and-property/rent-credit/used-by-child.aspx.  • Students may be eligible for reduced travel, more information can be found at about.leapcard.ie/young-adult-and-student-card-launch#eligible.

        "answerText": " Minister for the Environment, Climate and Communications (Deputy Eamon Ryan)  As part of Budget 2024 Government approved a new tranche of Emergency Electricity Credits which over 2.2 million households are benefitting from - worth €450 in total per household.  The payments are being applied to domestic electricity accounts, including those with Pay As You Go meters, which are subject to distribution use of system charges at the rate for urban domestic customers (DG1) or the rate for rural domestic customers (DG2).  Under Scheme III, usage levels were assessed to ensure that payments were withheld in relation to low usage electricity accounts identified by the distribution system operator, to prevent the payment from being applied to vacant houses.  ESB Networks identified accounts which consumed less than 150 kilowatt hours of electricity per quarter for four consecutive quarters between 1 July 2022 and 30 June 2023. Domestic electricity accounts flagged as low usage accounts, were not allocated a payment for that payment period. The payment was not withheld for accounts with a financial hardship meter, accounts held by registered vulnerable customers or accounts which have low usage due to the exporting of energy to the grid through microgeneration.  The Scheme allows for review by a customer’s electricity supplier, if contacted by a customer who has not received the payment. The customer can seek further review by the Commission for Regulation of Utilities, which has oversight of the Scheme, following the decision of the electricity supplier. I would encourage any customer who thinks that they should have received the credit to contact their supplier at the first instance, and then the CRU if they have still not received the credit.  CRU provides a dedicated email address for Oireachtas members, which enables them to raise questions on general energy regulatory matters to CRU at oireachtas@cru.ie for timely direct reply. ",

When this review of the current 2023 round is done, consideration can then be given to the timing of a further round of the SCEP. ",

        "answerText": " Minister of State at the Department of Education  Enabling children with special educational needs to receive an education is a priority for this government. It is also a key priority for my department and for the National Council for Special Education (NCSE).  The vast majority of children with special educational needs are supported to attend mainstream classes with their peers. Where children with more complex needs require additional supports, special classes and special school places are provided.  For 2024, €2.7 billion is being spent on special education, an increase of €113 million, and this is dedicated to providing supports for children with special educational needs. This will allow for, amongst other things, the opening of up to 400 new special classes in mainstream schools and 300 additional special school places.  In 2024, the number of teaching and SNA posts in our schools will increase with an additional 744 teachers and 1,216 SNAs added to deliver up to 2,700 new places for children with special educational needs. This will mean we will have over 41,500 qualified and committed people in our schools who are focused wholly and exclusively on supporting these children.  The NCSE has the responsibility for planning and coordinating school supports for children with special educational needs.  Over the last number of years, my department and the NCSE have introduced a number of strategic initiatives to plan for and provide sufficient special class and special school places.  These initiatives are bearing fruit with almost 1,300 new special classes sanctioned and seven new special schools established over the last four years.  My department engages intensely with the NCSE in relation to the forward planning of new special classes and additional special school places. This forward planning work is well underway ahead of the 2024/25 school year. This work involves a detailed review of statistical data in relation to forecasting demand for special class places, an analysis of available school accommodation, consideration of improved data sharing arrangements and a particular focus on the provision of special classes at post-primary level.  As a result of this forward planning, two new special schools have been established for this current school year in Cork and Dublin, with further capacity being expanded in 11 other special schools.  In addition, four new special schools will be established for the 2024/25 school year in counties Meath, Kildare, Wexford and Limerick. This will bring to 11 the number of new special schools established in recent years.  Along with the two new special schools opening this school year, 391 new special classes – 255 at primary and 136 at post-primary level – have been sanctioned by the NCSE.  Of these 72 are in Dublin, 49 at primary level and 23 at post-primary level. This brings to 535 the number of special classes in County Dublin, 409 at primary level and 126 at post-primary level. The vast majority of these class are autism classes and have a teacher/student ratio of 1:6.  Planning for special classes and special school places is currently underway ahead of the 2024/25 school year. Local NCSE teams continue to engage with schools at local level to provide sufficient special class places to meet the needs of children with special educational needs. The locations of the new classes will be confirmed by the NCSE shortly.  Parents seeking special class placements for their children are advised to contact the NCSE locally so that their needs can be taken into account for planning purposes. Local special educational needs organisers (SENOs) remain available to assist and advise parents of children with special educational needs. Parents may contact SENOs directly using the contact details available on the NCSE's website at: www.ncse.ie/regional-services-contact-list  My department will continue to support the NCSE and schools through the provision of the necessary funding and capital investment to ensure all children are successful in accessing an education.

[14376/24] ",
        "answerText": " Minister for Education  The Department of Education recently announced details of the 2024 Summer Programme on 21st March 2024.  All schools have an opportunity to run a programme over the summer months for children with complex special educational needs and those at greatest risk of educational disadvantage, so that they can be supported, nurtured and encouraged to continue to engage in a fun and inclusive educational setting.  The main priority in 2024 continues to be that those children with the most complex special educational needs, especially in special schools, should have access to a school-based summer programme.  All of the measures for the 2024 summer programme have been designed to maximise the number of schools and children taking part in the school-based programme.  There are a range of supports being provided to schools to facilitate them to run the programme which has seen the programme grow every year since 2019. In 2023, more than 50,000 children took part compared to 13,000 children in 2019. These supports include:  • In 2023, a pilot programme was developed specifically for special schools and a National Co-ordinator for Special Schools was appointed. This programme continues in 2024. The role of the National Co-ordinator has proved to be beneficial as it has resulted in an increase of more than 50% of special schools having participated.  • School Organiser Role – Since 2023, instead of preparation hours, there is a dedicated role of School Organiser in each school offering the summer programme. The School Organiser will receive additional remuneration for their role. This role is envisaged to be a key leadership role which offered development opportunities for staff in schools.  • Summer Programme Manager - In all schools (mainstream and special), the role that was previously called the Overseer is now called the Summer Programme Manager. The same person appointed as the School Organiser could also have been appointed to this role.  • Length of school day - For special schools, the length of the day was reduced from the full school day to 10am – 2pm. However, the same daily rate will have been paid to staff taking part. This was in recognition of the challenges associated with running the programme in a special school.  • Flexible grant funding - In order to reflect the unique circumstances that will arise in a special school during the summer months, additional grant funding of €2,000 will be provided for each week that a special school provides a school-based Summer Programme.  • Other enhanced measures are in place to encourage schools’ participation. These include a Centralised Application Process to reduce admin burden on schools and earlier payment of school staff.  A key barrier to the participation of schools previously has been the availability of staff, particularly those experienced staff already working in the schools. In 2023, to maximise the budget available for the summer programme, staff working on the school-based scheme, including teachers and SNAs, were paid at the higher personal rate of pay. Consequently, this has seen a much larger number of schools taking part, particularly in primary schools.  In addition, schools will be given the flexibility to engage staff that were not employed in their schools to support their summer programme. A staff portal will be available for teachers and SNAs to register their interest in working on a school-based programme. Student teachers and students in relevant disciplines such as therapy, social care and nursing and others, including early childcare workers and carers, will also be able to register their interest in working on this year’s Programme.  In 2023, the Inclusion Programme and Special Class elements from 2022 were combined to form one cohesive scheme for mainstream schools where the aim was to bring a more targeted approach for children with special educational needs. While the capitation rate in mainstream schools was raised to €45 in 2023, the €30 rate per week for 2024 is in line with the rate for the Inclusion Programme in previous years. It should be noted that this rate is cognisant of all costs associated with running a summer programme and is very favourably compared to the normal capitation during the school year, which is approximately €5 per week. To assist schools further this year, in the special class group or the combined group setting, schools also have the flexibility to consider how best to align the existing resource allocation to accommodate more children into these groups.  The capitation rate for special schools remains at €60 to reflect the unique circumstances of running a programme in those settings. ",

        "answerText": " Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage  The Government has developed the Cost Rental Tenant In-Situ (CRTiS) scheme for tenants in private rental homes who are at risk of homelessness because a landlord intends to sell the property but who are not in receipt of social housing supports.  The scheme was established on a temporary administrative basis from 1 April 2023 and is managed by the Housing Agency, pending further policy development over the longer term, with the intention of transitioning these homes to the standard Cost Rental model.  While my Department is not responsible for the assessment of individual applications, some of the reasons why properties are not approved for acquisition by the Housing Agency under the scheme include:  vendor expectations of the value of the property are in excess of the Housing Agency's independent valuation;  the vendor expectation and/or the market value of the property is in excess of the Acquisition Cost Guidelines for the relevant Local Authority area;  the condition of the property and the amount of works required to bring it to an acceptable standard make it too difficult for the Housing Agency to pursue the acquisition further; or  the vendor withdraws or wants to take the property to the market.  As a result, not every home will be eligible for acquisition within the constraints of these factors. At all times, the Housing Agency is mindful of the purpose of the CRTiS scheme, which is to assist tenants at risk of homelessness, the need to ensure value for money in the expenditure of public funds, and the goal that acquired homes be suitable for use as Cost Rental housing over the long term.

On Saturday 16th March, the Department offered International Protection (IP) applicants occupying tents at Mount Street an alternative location to pitch tents. This was done in cooperation with Dublin City Council due to the emerging public health and security risks. IP applicants were brought to Crooksling where they were provided with access to toilets and showers, health services, indoor areas where food is provided, facilities to charge phones and personal devices, access to public transport to and from Dublin City Centre and 24 hour on-site security.  Drop-in day services remain available to all persons not offered accommodation by the department who pitch a tent on Mount Street, as well as other persons found to be street homeless, who wish to avail of them. In such centres, IP applicants can access facilities including hot showers, meals and laundry services seven days a week at these service locations.  The Department has arrangements in place for the provision of these services with Mendicity, Crosscare, Capuchin Day Centre and Tiglin at the Lighthouse. The Department is in also in regular contact with the Dublin Regional Homeless Executive, the Dublin Simon Community, Streetlink Homeless Support Outreach service and others, particularly with regard identification of particularly vulnerable individuals.
