I am advised by National Broadband Ireland (NBI) that there are over 564,000 premises in the Intervention Area (IA) and design work has been completed for 100% of these. NBI anticipated they would pass 420,000 premises by the end of 2025. NBI have exceeded that figure in already passing over 439,700 premises in the intervention area and are connecting on average 4,500 premises to their fibre network per month.  NBI also advise that 450,950 premises, across all counties in mainly rural areas, can now order or pre-order broadband and over 158,050 premises are already connected.  Based on current plans and achievements, the Department expect to deliver the deployment of the NBP by the end of 2026, as per the Programme for Government commitment.  Further details are available on specific counties and areas which can be monitored via nbi.ie/reps.

        "answerText": " Minister for Education and Youth  The major project referred to by the Deputy is being delivered under my Departments ADAPT Programme.  ADAPT is an acronym for \" A ccelerated D elivery of A rchitectural P lanning and T endering\".  The ADAPT Programme uses a professional external Project Manager to co-ordinate and drive the Design Team to achieve the best possible timeframe during the stages of architectural planning.  The brief for this project is to deliver a new permanent 8 classroom Primary School with 2 classes for pupils with Special Educational Needs, at the schools current location in Mount Merrion.  The major project is currently at Stage 2(a) of Architectural Planning.  Stage 2(a) – Developed Design - is a crucial element of the architectural planning process as it is at this stage that the design is developed to a stage where it can be fully cost planned and prepared to lodge for statutory approvals.  The Design Team recently submitted a Stage 2a Report and my Department officials are currently carrying out their review of this report.  In July the Government announced a capital allocation of €7.55 billion for the Department of Education and Youth for the period 2026-2030 under the National Development Plan. As part of this NDP allocation my department will place a strong emphasis on provision for children with special educational needs, with a particular focus on meeting annual school place needs. In relation to project rollout for Large-Scale projects and Additional School Accommodation scheme projects, the approach will be to continue to maximise the capacity of the existing school estate as much as possible in the first instance and provide necessary additional capacity through targeted and prioritised project rollout over the course of 2026 to 2030 period to meet the most urgent and prioritised needs.  Government departments are currently in the process of publishing their sectoral NDP Implementation Plans. The sectoral plan for the Education and Youth sector will be published next week and the first tranche of projects to progress to construction will be published in January. This NDP Implementation Plan will optimise outputs from the NDP allocations, with a strong focus on maximising existing school capacity, progressing priority projects where local capacity across schools in the area is insufficient, and ensuring delivery that is affordable, offers value for money, and meets functional needs.

        "answerText": " Minister for Education and Youth  The provision of school places is a priority for the Department of Education and Youth and there has been significant capital investment in schools in South County Dublin and North Wicklow to meet the needs of the local population. This includes new schools established in recent years in Stepaside, Cherrywood, Bray and Goatstown. This good forward planning is informed by demographic analysis, including information on planned residential development.  At primary level, enrolments at schools in the area have been declining since 2016. Nevertheless, there has been capital investment at schools in the area to support the establishment of special classes.  The Department’s databases show that there are fewer than 600 post primary school-going young people living in the Kilternan School Planning Area. These students are catered for at schools in neighbouring areas primarily in the Ballinteer-Stepaside and Goatstown-Stillorgan school planning areas. Some €134 million has been invested by my Department since 2020 in these three school planning areas alone. There is capacity in these and other adjacent areas at post-primary level and further post-primary school building projects are planned. This includes large scale capital projects to substantially increase capacity at Stepaside Educate Together Secondary to over 1000 pupils, the first phase of which has already been delivered. Additionally, projects are planned that will provide capacity for over 1,000 students at Goatstown Educate Together Secondary and for over 500 students at Gaelcholáiste Phiarsaigh.  It is acknowledged that even where there is capacity available, there can be enrolment pressures in an area due to duplicate applications, school of choice and other factors. The Department works closely with schools in areas of enrolment pressure to identify any requirement for additional provision and to put any required solutions in place.  The Department will continue to work to ensure that there is good school place provision for children and young people living in Kilternan. ",

        "answerText": " Minister for Social Protection  The social protection system has a range of supports available to parents who are raising children, including Child Benefit, the Child Support Payment and the Working Family Payment. With the exception of the universal Child Benefit, these schemes provide targeted assistance that is directly linked to household income and thereby support low-income families with children. Each of the schemes assist parents with the cost associated with raising children and contribute to alleviating child poverty.  The rules regarding each of these payments are contained in the relevant legislation and regulations. In general, only one payment is made in respect of each qualified child, this payment is made to the qualified person with whom the child is normally resident.  In the case of separated parents, the child shall be considered normally resident with the parent who has custody of the child, provided that the parent is making significant contributions to the child’s upkeep. Where a child is the subject of a joint custody arrangement and lives with both parents part-time, their normal residence is considered to be with the parent they spend most time with.  A parent who is divorced or separated, and who is not cohabiting, may be entitled to a One-Parent Family Payment, or Jobseeker’s Transitional Payment, subject to meeting all eligibility criteria.  The Department regularly reviews all of its schemes in order to ensure that they are still delivering on their policy aims and objectives. Any changes to the treatment of payments after divorce or separation would have to be considered in a wider policy and budgetary context.  I trust this clarifies matters for the Deputy. ",

        "answerText": " Deputy Maeve O'Connell  I ask the Minister for Transport if any analysis has been conducted on the completion of active travel projects and, in particular, any impact they may have had on the carbon emissions of commuters in Dublin or across the country. \n Deputy Seán Canney  I thank the Deputy for asking this very important question. Based on large-scale surveys and analysis from the NTA's Walking and Cycling Index 2023 for Ireland’s five metropolitan areas - Dublin, Cork, Galway, Limerick-Shannon, and Waterford - active travel is delivering significant environmental benefits nationally.  Walking, wheeling and cycling in these metropolitan areas remove approximately 680,000 car trips every day, reducing congestion and meaningfully cutting emissions. In 2023 alone, active travel saved an estimated 160,000 tonnes of greenhouse gas emissions, equivalent to 2.2 million passenger trips from Dublin to London Heathrow. In addition to environmental benefits, the economic impact of active travel across the five metropolitan areas is estimated at over €3 billion annually, alongside major and important improvements in public health and air quality.  The Deputy refers specifically to commuters in County Dublin and I am delighted to say that every day those commuters who walk, wheel or cycle are taking nearly 530,000 cars off the road in the Dublin metropolitan area. These practices are saving approximately 120,000 tonnes of greenhouse gas emissions. I have more figures here for the Deputy.  To ensure we are moving in the right direction, the NTA, in conjunction with the relevant local authorities, has produced a transport strategy for the greater Dublin area, as well as metropolitan area transport strategies for the cities of Cork, Limerick and Waterford, with one under way for Galway. These strategies set out the measures that will help us achieve a 51% reduction in emissions by 2030 and set us on a path towards zero net emissions by 2050.  To verify that the measures in the strategies are being implemented in a co-ordinated, effective and timely manner, the NTA will undertake a monitoring programme and will produce a report which will be finalised for the greater Dublin area in advance of the review of the strategy for the greater Dublin area, which is due to commence in 2026. \n Deputy Maeve O'Connell  My constituency of Dublin-Rathdown has seen significant change during the past five years through the development of active travel greenways and other similar schemes. Over €80 million has been spent, with €29 million allocated in 2025 alone, to support the various commitments in the national sustainable mobility policy to get people out of cars to walk and cycle instead, as well as the climate action plan which aims to reduce transport emissions overall. Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council, of which I was a member, led the way on these schemes. Kilometres of lanes have been built, concrete and plastic dividers have been installed, junctions have been narrowed, filter lanes have been removed, roads have been closed and new traffic lights and traffic sequences have been installed. After five years of investment, and counting, we still do not really have any clarity as to whether this investment is actually delivering because we do not really know whether our emissions have been reduced. We have estimates and surveys but have we actually done the assessment before all of these things were implemented, and afterwards, to see whether the emissions were actually reduced? \n Deputy Seán Canney  As I said, large-scale surveys were carried out in 2023. That is what we have at this stage. When we are investing money in active travel we want to make sure before we start that it will actually deliver what it says on the tin and we want to see afterwards if we got the necessary outputs. That is the same for every infrastructure project we carry out. There is an assessment carried out before projects are started to see what benefits they will bring. I will go back to the Department to see what other data we have or hope to get because, from my own background, I understand that if we are spending money on something, we have to find out if it is value for money, and not just in an intangible way. We have to see the facts and figures. It is important we see the outcomes that are delivered from the investment of taxpayers' money in these projects. I welcome the Deputy's question on this matter. \n Deputy Maeve O'Connell  I appreciate that the Minister of State and I seem to be singing off the same hymn sheet. I attended one of the original proposal meetings on what are now called \"active travel schemes\" back in 2020. The overseeing consultants assured us then that traffic would just disappear if we implemented these schemes. The only real, empirical report I am aware of is on Kilmacud after new cycle lanes, road closures and various other infrastructure were implemented. It showed traffic did not disappear but was just displaced, with increased rat-running car speeds. After that particular scheme, there was actually less walking and cycling in the area. Anecdotally, my constituents in Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown report that they are making longer journeys than they did five years ago. For example, a constituent recently highlighted to me that when doing the big family shop, her 3 km car journey from Dunnes Stores in Cornelscourt took her 45 minutes.  One possible consequence of a lot of these investments has been increased motor vehicle congestion. I accept some people are definitely walking and cycling more. I know that from anecdotal evidence from constituents as well. However, others are driving more and taking longer journeys. My question, therefore, is whether overall emissions are up or down. \n An Cathaoirleach Gníomhach (Deputy Conor Sheehan)  Thank you, Deputy. \n Deputy Maeve O'Connell  If we cannot say, do not know or do not know yet, then do we know if we are pouring good money after bad? \n Deputy Seán Canney  From the surveys and data I have given the Deputy, I am convinced we are reducing CO2 emissions. In my own opinion, having been talking about this issue for the past hour and a half, when we put in active travel measures we need to talk about having effective public transport. We have an integrated transport travel system that will give an experience to pedestrians, cyclists and people using public transport so they will continue to use that. As regards some of the improvements we have to make, in order to get more cars off the road we have to be able to say to people that they will be able to get to places on time, will be able to go shopping and get a bus back, will be able to get to work because a service will be there for them, and that they will have a bit of comfort in whatever mode of transport they use. That is the challenge and with the demands we have, it is important we continue to challenge ourselves to make sure we are delivering value for money and getting the results we want. \n An Cathaoirleach Gníomhach (Deputy Conor Sheehan)  We will take Deputy Bennett's question and a brief response.

        "answerText": " Minister for Transport (Deputy Darragh O'Brien)  As Minister for Transport, I have responsibility for policy and overall funding in relation to Active Travel. Funding is administered through the National Transport Authority (NTA), who, in partnership with local authorities, have responsibility for the selection and development of specific projects in each local authority area. I recognise that public consultation and engagement are key to the successful development of community active travel projects.  Department of Transport funded projects are subject to statutory and non-statutory public consultations. My Department is working with local authorities in order to create an environment whereby there will be greater levels of community engagement at early stages of infrastructure projects in order to enhance public support for these important projects, without which they will not have the desired impact in terms of modal shift and emissions reduction.  In addition, the upcoming Moving Together Strategy (2026–2030) outlines a comprehensive framework for embedding public engagement into transport planning and delivery, with a strong emphasis on co-creation, inclusivity, and local decision-making.  A key initiative supporting this is the Sustainable Mobility Academy (SMA), launched at the 2024 National Sustainable Mobility Forum. The SMA is designed to:  • Train and upskill staff in local authorities and transport bodies in best-practice public engagement and consultation methods.  • Provide on-demand modules, site visits and toolkits to support effective community engagement.  • Serve as a knowledge-sharing platform for professionals across government, academia, and the private sector.  • Disseminate case studies and evidence-based guidance to support behavioural change and demand management at the local level.  The Academy is part of a broader effort to build capacity for transformative projects, ensuring that public consultations are not just statutory exercises but meaningful opportunities for communities to shape their transport environments.

        "answerText": " Minister for Enterprise, Tourism and Employment  The National Training Fund (NTF) has a valuable role to play as Ireland faces critical challenges in responding to the skills and workforce development needs arising from major global disruptors including the digital and climate transitions, demographic change, and deglobalisation. My Department has been engaging closely with the Department of Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science in recent years to explore ways to unlock the NTF surplus and embed continuous skills development in the labour market. In light of the range of competitiveness challenges Ireland currently faces, it is essential that employers, employees, and those seeking employment have access to appropriate learning and development supports.  The NTF funding package agreed as part of Budget 2025 will ensure essential investment in the tertiary sector over the next six years. This funding package includes capital funding which required an amendment to the National Training Fund Act. The funding will be channelled through agencies of Department of Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science (DFHERIS) as these agencies provide the main levers for investment in skills and training in Ireland. Over the course of this year, officials from my Department have been in regular contact with colleagues from DFHERIS as proposals were made and drafting begun for the National Training Fund (Amendment) Bill 2025.  The proposed investment is fully aligned with the skills needs of the enterprise sector including the client bases of IDA Ireland, Enterprise Ireland, and the Local Enterprise Offices, and will play a crucial role in future-proofing the Irish economy and safeguarding employment and the workforce from significant global disruptors. I welcome the recognition that there should be consultation with my Department and Enterprise Ireland to ensure skills interventions are aligned to industry needs and the needs of indigenous enterprise.  Officials from the Labour Market and Skills Unit in my Department are participating in a steering group that is working with the ESRI on an evaluation and monitoring framework for the National Training Fund. I fully support the work of the ESRI and I look forward to reviewing this research when available. In light of the scale of the NTF, it is essential that we get better information on the impact of schemes – whether that be upskilling those in employment or training for those who wish to acquire skills to take up employment. Following the recent legislative changes to the NTF, it will be important that we continue to monitor the impact the NTF is having on skills in the labour market. ",

        "answerText": " Minister for Children, Disability and Equality  An evaluation of the first year of Core Funding and the development of an evaluation framework for Core Funding is currently underway. This project will examine the early implementation of Core Funding and make recommendations for future evaluations of the grant. Findings from the project are expected in Quarter 4 2025.  The parameters of this review were limited to the first year of Core Funding and as such, I do not anticipate this review providing a comprehensive set of recommendations for immediate implementation. Rather, this review will highlight remedial actions that can be incorporated without disruption to the ongoing operation of Core Funding. Importantly, this review will provide a robust mechanism that will allow the Department, on an ongoing basis, to conduct more robust assessments of the efficacy and efficiency of Core Funding.  More specifically, this review will present an analysis of the first year of Core Funding, activities, and expenditure – covering the period of 15 September 2022 to 31 August 2023. It will set out an evaluation framework for Core Funding so that subsequent medium and long-term evaluations can ensure the scheme is meeting its intended objectives and that it is an efficient use of exchequer funding. Where relevant, it will also highlight data gaps that exist, and further data that may require collection to comprehensively evaluate the scheme.  This project is being undertaken by Irish Government Economic and Evaluation Service or IGEES policy analysts working in the Research and Evaluation Unit of the Department.  It is envisaged that the future evaluations will have a broader scope and will be governed by a Steering Group. The terms of reference for future evaluations will be informed by the recommendations arising from the evaluation of the first year of the grant.  In addition to this project, it is worth noting that since the Core Funding was first introduced in 2022, its effectiveness has been subject to ongoing review and the Scheme itself has evolved year on year in response.  The introduction of Core Funding in 2022 brought a significant increase in investment for the sector, with €259 million of funding paid directly to services in year 1 of the scheme, of which €210.8 million was entirely new funding.  Core funding increased by 11% to reach €287 million for the second year, and by a further 15% to €331 million for the third year of the scheme. The allocation of this additional funding in year 2 and 3 of was informed by the data from previous years, feedback from stakeholders as well as an independent financial review of sessional services by Frontier Economics.  Targeted supports for small and sessional services introduced in year 2, were enhanced in year 3.  Moreover, changes to fee management were introduced in year 3, enabling low fee services to apply for a fee increase.  The full year allocation for year 4 of Core Funding is over €390 million. This includes funding specifically ringfenced to support employers to meet the costs of increases to the minimum rates of pay in the sector that came into effect on 13 October. ",

        "answerText": " Minister for Children, Disability and Equality  Improving access to quality and affordable Early Learning and Care and School Age Childcare is a key priority of Government.  Early learning and childcare capacity is increasing. Data from the Annual Early Years Sector Profile 2023/24 shows that the estimated number of enrolments increased by approximately 19% from the 2021/22 programme year. However, it appears that demand for early learning and childcare remains higher than available supply in certain parts of the country, particularly for younger children.  A forward planning model will be central to the Department's plans to achieve the policy goals set out in the Programme for Government to build an affordable, high-quality, accessible early childhood education and care system, with State-led facilities adding capacity.  As announced in the context of Budget 2026, €36 million will be available in 2026 for early learning and childcare capital programmes. This will include acquisitions of new buildings through the State-led early learning and childcare programme, investment in expansion of existing early learning and childcare operators through the Building Blocks scheme and a number of quality initiatives including supports to childminders.  The Department continues to support the ongoing development and resourcing of Core Funding which has given rise to a significant expansion of places since the scheme was first introduced. Core Funding, which is in its fourth programme year, funds services based on the number of places available.  Budget 2025 secured funding for the fourth programme year (2025/6) to facilitate a further 3.5% increase from September 2025.  Budget 2026 has made provision for the fifth programme year (2026/7) for a further expansion in supply of 4.2%.  This increased investment will allow increases in growth of the sector driven both by new services joining the sector and existing services offering more places and/or longer hours to families.  The total allocation for Core Funding in 2026/2027 programme year will increase to €436.54 million, an additional €43.90 million on the current full year allocation.  Capital funding allocated to the early learning and childcare sector under the National Development Plan has enabled significant investment in early learning and childcare. This allows existing Core Funding Partner Services to extend their existing premises or, in the case of community services, to construct or purchase new premises.  The Building Blocks Extension Grant Scheme was launched in late 2024 with a closing date in January 2025. There were four strands to the scheme: Community Construction, Community Extension, Community Purchasing and Private Extension. A total of 78 applications were received with 50 applicants approved to progress to the next stage of the grant process. The scheme will deliver up to 1,500 places from next year. ",

This assessment concluded in March 2024, following engagement with complainants and the European Commission.  Based on the information available and its prioritisation principles, the CCPC decided not to pursue further action. Key factors informing this decision included:  • No evidence of anti-competitive behaviour or abuse of dominance, as required under Irish and EU competition law.  • Variation in licensing practices across publishers, which did not suggest coordinated conduct.  • Fundamental differences between eBooks and print books, making direct comparisons and cost assessments complex.  • Overlap with intellectual property and public policy issues, which may be better addressed outside the scope of competition enforcement.  • Jurisdictional and resource constraints, given that many relevant publishers are based outside Ireland.

        "answerText": " Minister for Culture, Communications and Sport  The National Broadband Plan (NBP) is the Government initiative to deliver high-speed broadband to all premises in Ireland. In addition, Ireland's Digital Connectivity Strategy published in December 2022, sets out a number of targets including that all Irish households and businesses will be covered by a Gigabit network no later than 2028, eliminating broadband blackspots where a premises receives less than 30 Mbps download and 6 Mbps upload.  The Programme for Government – Securing Ireland’s Future published in January 2025 sets a number of targets which include the completion of the installation of high-speed fibre broadband to 1.1 million people, including homes, farms, and businesses nationwide, by 2026.  National Broadband Ireland (NBI) advises that the Intervention Area contains over 564,000 premises and that design work for 100% of these premises has been completed. NBI has passed 420,540 premises across 26 counties, is connecting approximately 4,400 premises to its fibre network per month and 150,585 premises are already connected to the NBP high-speed network.  Further details are available on specific areas which can be monitored via nbi.ie/reps/ . NBI has a dedicated email address, reps@nbi.ie, which can be used by Oireachtas members for specific queries.  Alongside the NBP intervention contract, commercial operators continue to expand next-generation networks throughout the State and contribute materially to achieving the Digital Connectivity Strategy targets. The Department is conducting a detailed analysis of scenarios where it may be uneconomic for commercial operators to deliver a Gigabit Capable Network to premises outside the NBP Intervention Area; once this analysis is complete the Department will examine optimal policy responses, including cost and legal considerations, to address any identified Gigabit Blackspots. The final scale and location of any such gaps cannot be fully quantified until currently planned commercial roll-out programmes through 2026 are complete. ",

        "answerText": " Minister for Children, Disability and Equality  In setting regulatory requirements for early learning and care and school-age childcare services, the primary consideration must be children’s health, safety and well-being.  The minimum adult-to-child ratios for pre-school services are set out in Schedule 6 of the Child Care Act 1991 (Early Years Services) Regulations 2016. The ratios set the maximum number of children allowed per staff member working directly with the children, and services can choose to have fewer children per staff member if they wish.  The minimum required ratios of adults to children in pre-school services for full-day care or part-time provision are: 1:3 for children under 1 year old; 1:5 for children aged between 1 and 2 years old; 1:6 for 2 year olds; and 1:8 for pre-school children aged between 3 and 6.  For children in sessional (less than 3.5 hours) pre-school provision who are aged between 2 years 6 months and 6 years old, there is a minimum adult-child ratio of 1:11. This sessional minimum ratio of 1:11 applies to children participating in the Early Childhood Care and Education (ECCE) programme, for which the eligible age group is children between 2 year 8 months and 5 year 6 months.  The difference in the minimum ratios for sessional and full-day care reflects the greater care needs for full-day provision for this age-group, including time for rest and meals.  The minimum adult-child ratios in Ireland are broadly similarly to minimum ratios in other European countries according to the most recent (2025) edition of the Eurydice / European Commission report on 'Key Data on Early Childhood Education and Care in Europe' .  There are no plans at present to revise the minimum adult-to-child ratios for pre-school services. ",

A recent review by the OECD for Ireland found that participation in lifelong learning in Ireland, while above the EU average, falls behind other top EU performers.  My Department is conducting a behavioural research programme to understand how learners of all ages make decisions about their education. This programme will deliver actionable insights into the decision-making processes of learners to inform policy and communication strategies to encourage upskilling, reskilling and lifelong learning.  The research programme is being carried out by the ESRI’s Behavioural Research Unit over two years.  Phase One of the project, the literature review, concluded in August 2025 and the outputs are being used to design the first of two diagnostic studies to better understand learner decision making (Phase Two).  Phase Three of the project will test a number of potential interventions to identify the most successful.  All outputs from the programme, which is due to conclude mid 2027, will be published in the form of journal articles, policy papers and/or books/book chapters. ",

The initiative has been highly successful in increasing capacity in areas of key skills need and in enhancing innovation and agility within higher education institutions.  While the HCI programme has now concluded and is not being extended, the Department and the Higher Education Authority are working with the sector to ensure that key innovations developed under HCI Pillar 3 are embedded within participating institutions.  Although HCI has formally ended, HCI Pillar 3 Micro-Credential Learner Fee Subsidy, introduced in February 2024, continues into the current academic year, learners can avail of the subsidy up until 31st October 2025. This provides a 50–80% fee reduction for almost 13,900 places across more than 650 micro-credential courses in areas such as Artificial Intelligence, Biopharma, Construction, Cyber Security, Engineering, ICT and Finance.  In addition, Springboard+ 2025, launched in May, is offering almost 8,000 places on 249 courses, including micro-credentials and full-time ICT skills conversion courses. In January, a call was issued to HEIs for proposals for courses to be included in the Springboard+ for the next three years, the call specified that courses subsidised under HCI Pillar 1 and micro-credential courses may be included in proposals.  Furthermore, the Enterprise Focused Higher Education (EFHE) measure provides recurrent funding to HEIs for programmes aligned with identified labour market needs, complementing the objectives of the HCI.  These measures will ensure that our higher education sector can continue to respond to skills needs and respond to emerging industry requirements in an innovative and agile manner. ",

A further €2.5 million was secured to reduce the cost of attending higher education by permanently lowering fees by 17% for over 14,000 apprentices in the 2025/26 academic year.  In recent years, supported by strong government investment, the apprenticeship system has grown significantly. Annual craft apprenticeship registrations have risen 63% from 4,377 in 2020, the year in which my department was formed, to 7,113 in 2024. In the same period Consortia-led registrations have grown from 949 to 2,239.  This investment has also supported a 34% growth in the number of apprenticeship programmes available from 58 to 78. There are now 25 craft apprenticeship programmes and 53 consortia-led programmes designed to serve industry needs across multiple sectors such as construction, ICT, hospitality, health, and social care - supporting Ireland both economically and socially. Work is ongoing to expand apprenticeship options further, with new programmes in development.  Building on this progress, next year we will launch the Action Plan for Apprenticeship 2026–2030, setting a target to increase annual apprentice registrations from 9,352 in 2024 to 12,500 by 2030. Stakeholder consultations on the new Plan are scheduled to commence shortly.  With the significant investment in Budget 2026 bringing the total funding for apprenticeship to over €400 million, a strong foundation has been laid to achieve the 12,500 target and support national infrastructure projects.

As I said in my previous reply, this Government is committed to tackling the issue of vacancy and dereliction. The vacant homes action plan published in January 2023 sets out a range of measures and actions being pursued to return vacant and derelict properties to use as homes. In March, the Minister, Deputy Browne, and I published the 2025 progress report, which shows the significant progress that is being made. It is available on my Department's website.  One of the key measures in the action plan is supporting the refurbishment of older, vacant and derelict properties using the vacant property refurbishment grant. This is a grant that can provide up to €50,000 towards the refurbishment of vacant properties for use as homes and up to €70,000 where that property is derelict. To the end of June, more than 13,700 grant applications have been received across the country. Almost 10,000 have been approved and more than 2,800 grants have been paid, amounting to over €155 million. My Department publishes data on the grant on its website on a quarterly basis, providing a breakdown by local authority area. I will arrange to have the link to this published data circulated.  A comprehensive review of the vacant property refurbishment grant was undertaken in 2024. That review considered all aspects of the scheme. The findings of this review have been considered in the context of the development of the new housing plan, which will be published shortly. The grant has been and continues to be successful in bringing vacant and derelict properties back into use and in making the refurbishment of these properties an affordable option for buyers across the country. It acts as a significant support for younger persons who are starting out on the property ladder.  A wide range of other schemes are in place that also support the refurbishment and conversion of older buildings for housing. The repair and lease scheme provides an interest-free loan of up to €80,000 per home delivered to support the refurbishment and conversion of vacant buildings for use as social housing. This is a scheme that is increasingly used to renovate vacant commercial premises, including above the shop. There has been a huge positive impact from this scheme in my constituency of Waterford. About 55% of the national total of repair and lease units in the country have been delivered in Waterford, with one- and two-bedroom properties in town and city areas providing much-needed homes for families. I want to see more local authorities availing of that scheme.  Planning exemptions are available for the conversion of certain vacant commercial properties into residential use, which are proving successful. In 2024 alone, more than 290 exemption notifications for more than 700 homes were provided, the highest yearly total since their introduction. This was extended to include former vacant pubs a couple of years ago. It is the intention to extend those exemptions further through the exempted development.  As Deputy O'Connell, in budget 2026, the living city initiative, which is a tax relief, can be claimed and extended to other counties, as well as improving the level of support that is being provided through the scheme. We also made provision for a derelict property tax in the budget. As stated earlier, we have such a broad range of schemes providing the carrot to bring those vacant and derelict properties back into productive use for housing purposes, and if people are not going to use those carrots, the stick of the derelict property tax is coming. I encourage people to work with local authorities to use those schemes and bring those properties back into productive use, because what frustrates people most is seeing vacant and derelict properties across this country during a time of such need. \n Deputy Maeve O'Connell  I welcome all those supports. In my constituency, we have some of these issues in the context of neighbourhood centres, which are neither shops nor accommodation. That is frustrating. I would like to follow up on the derelict sites levy, which is to become a tax. When do we anticipate that it will be activated to try to encourage more of these properties to be brought back into use? \n Deputy John Cummins  It is the intention that local authorities will still have a significant role to play in the context of the new derelict sites tax by creating the register that Revenue will implement.  There has been an issue in collecting the existing levy. That is why we are moving to introduce it as a tax that will be collected by Revenue. We encourage people to use the supports there and if they do not use them, the stick of the derelict property tax is coming. \n An Ceann Comhairle  I thank the Minister of State. We are out of time.

        "answerText": " Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage (Deputy James Browne)  I propose to take Questions Nos. 119 and 130 together.  Addressing vacancy and dereliction is a key priority for Government.  The Vacant Homes Action Plan, published in January 2023, set out the various actions being pursued to return vacant properties back into use as homes. In March, I published the 2025 Progress Report which shows the significant progress that is being made and it is available on my Department's website at the following link: www.gov.ie/en/publication/df86c-vacant-homes-action-plan-2023-2026/ .  Data in relation to vacant properties is available from a number of sources such as the CSO, Census 2022 and GeoDirectory.  The Central Statistics Office (CSO) has recently developed a new statistical release on residential vacancy. The release, published on 24 September 2025, provides information on the extent of residential vacancy in 2022 and 2023, using ESB data on metered residential electricity consumption, with future regular publications planned.  In the release, the CSO note a national vacancy rate of 3.3% at the end of Q4 2023, down from 3.6% in Q4 2022. Data is provided at a national, local authority and local electoral level, including for Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown and Cork County. This release will further inform our understanding of vacancy and the development of policy and measures to address it.  In the latest GeoDirectory Residential Buildings Report for Q2 2025, the average vacancy rate across Ireland had dropped to 3.7%, the lowest rate recorded since 2013; a local authority breakdown is also provided.  My Department has also supported local authorities to collate data on vacant and derelict properties in their administrative areas. Almost all local authorities, including Cork County Council and Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council, now have a database of vacant properties which they can update on an ongoing basis. The database is not intended to be a comprehensive count of every vacant and derelict property in their administrative area. It is used by the local authority to engage with property owners and work with them to bring those properties back into use.  Under section 8 of the Derelict Sites Act 1990, a local authority is obliged to maintain a Derelict Sites Register and shall enter on to the register the particulars of any land in their functional area which, in their opinion, is a derelict site. Under Section 23 of the Act, local authorities may apply a Derelict Sites Levy (DSL), on an annual basis, for sites entered on the derelict sites register on the 1 January of that year. Data is provided on the number of properties on Derelict Sites Registers in Cork County and Dun Laoghaire-Rathdown in 2022 and 2023. My Department is currently engaged with all local authorities in the process of collecting and collating the 2024 annual returns.      Local Authority      No. of Derelict Sites on Register at 31 December 2022      No. of Derelict Sites on Register at 31 December 2023       Cork County    59    71      Dun Laoghaire Rathdown    11    10     While varying levels and rates of vacancy are indicated in the different data sources, the overall trend is downwards and vacancy levels are declining.

        "answerText": " Minister for Transport  The improvement and maintenance of regional and local roads is the statutory responsibility of each local authority, in accordance with the provisions of Section 13 of the Roads Act 1993. Works on those roads are funded from Councils' own resources supplemented by State grants. Regarding the four Dublin Councils, arising from the arrangements in place in relation to Local Property Tax receipts, the four Dublin Councils are largely self-funding for works on regional and local roads since 2015 and my Department no longer provides grants to these Councils under the main regional and local road grant categories. It is therefore the responsibility of the local authority to ensure that junction improvements are applied, as appropriate, in the design of all urban road schemes.  The layout and geometry of priority junctions in urban areas can have a significant impact on the safety and comfort of people using the junction, particularly those using active travel modes of transport including walking, wheeling and cycling. Historically, most priority junctions in urban areas were designed to standards more applicable to rural roads which prioritised the movement of vehicular traffic, often at the expense of other road users. Large junctions with wide corner radii encourage high vehicle turning speeds, unofficial two lane exits and poor pedestrian crossing facilities, all of which pose a threat to the safety of those walking, wheeling and cycling. Moreover, large junctions negatively impact the most vulnerable in our society. This includes the disabled and elderly people who may struggle to traverse large junctions where vehicles travel at high speeds, thus risking both their safety and mental well-being as they attempt to navigate their way through the urban environment. Junctions are often critical links on any pedestrian route and can represent an area of potential conflict between pedestrians and vehicular traffic. It is therefore important that the layout and geometry of junctions facilitate and prioritise the safe passage of pedestrians in accordance with the national sustainable transport policy.  The Design Manual for Urban Roads and Streets (DMURS) was first launched in 2013 by the then Ministers for Transport, Tourism and Sport and Housing, Planning and Local Government. The goal of DMURS is to address street designs within urban areas and ensure that the street design considers the type of place in which the street is located while balancing the needs of all users. DMURS aims to put well designed streets at the heart of sustainable communities in order to create connected physical, social and transport networks that promote alternatives to car journeys. As such, DMURS should also be considered in line with other guidelines such as the Cycle Design Manual.  DMURS recommends that road safety audits be undertaken on the design of all roads and streets, where applicable. The purpose of these audits is to demonstrate that appropriate consideration has been given to all the relevant aspects of the design, including visual quality, how the street may be used by the community, road safety, access, walking, cycling, non-motorised users and community street and place checks. It is important to note that the Local Authority as sponsoring agency is responsible for ensuring that all the required audits are undertaken and remedial measures which may be required are put in place.  As Minister for Transport, I have responsibility for overall policy and exchequer funding in relation to the National Roads Programme. Under the Roads Acts 1993-2015 and in line with the National Development Plan (NDP), the operation and management of individual national roads is a matter for Transport Infrastructure Ireland (TII), in conjunction with the local authorities concerned. This is also subject to the Infrastructure Guidelines and the necessary statutory approvals. In this context, TII is best placed to advise you in relation to junction tightening on the National Road network.  I also have responsibility for policy and overall funding in relation to Active Travel. Funding is administered through the National Transport Authority (NTA), who, in partnership with local authorities, have responsibility for the selection and development of specific projects in each local authority area.  Noting the roles of TII and the NTA in the matter, I have referred your question to these agencies for a more detailed answer. Please advise my private office if you do not receive a reply within 10 working days. ",

DMURS provides specific advice on this matter whereby junctions can be tightened while still allowing HGVs to safely traverse the junction. This includes:  • Increasing the carriageway width at junctions to provide additional manoeuvrability without signalling to drivers that the corner can be taken at greater speed;  • Vehicular stop lines can be set back at signalised junctions to allow turning vehicles to cross the centre line of the intersecting street without conflicting with oncoming movements.  It is important to note that local authorities and their designers are responsible for understanding the surrounding environment, the number of vehicles along with the different vehicle types which a road scheme must cater for and design the junction accordingly.

Works on those roads are funded from Councils' own resources supplemented by State grants. In addition, arising from the arrangements in place in relation to Local Property Tax receipts, the four Dublin Councils are largely self-funding for works on regional and local roads since 2015 and my Department no longer provides grants to these Councils under the main regional and local road grant categories.  It is the responsibility of the local authority as sponsoring agency to ensure that junction improvements and narrowing works are applied appropriately in the design of urban road schemes, and reviewed in accordance with the project objectives.  The Design Manual for Urban Roads and Streets (DMURS) was first launched in 2013 by the then Ministers for Transport, Tourism and Sport and Housing, Planning and Local Government. The goal of DMURS is to address street designs within urban areas and ensure that the street design considers the type of place in which the street is located while balancing the needs of all users. DMURS aims to put well designed streets at the heart of sustainable communities in order to create connected physical, social and transport networks that promote alternatives to car journeys. As such, DMURS should also be considered in line with other guidelines such as the Cycle Design Manual.  As Minister for Transport, I have responsibility for overall policy and exchequer funding in relation to the National Roads Programme. Under the Roads Acts 1993-2015 and in line with the National Development Plan (NDP), the operation and management of individual national roads is a matter for Transport Infrastructure Ireland (TII), in conjunction with the local authorities concerned. This is also subject to the Infrastructure Guidelines and the necessary statutory approvals. In this context, TII is best placed to advise you in relation to junction tightening on the National Road network.  I also have responsibility for policy and overall funding in relation to Active Travel. Funding is administered through the National Transport Authority (NTA), who, in partnership with local authorities, have responsibility for the selection and development of specific projects in each local authority area.  Noting the roles of TII and the NTA in the matter, I have referred your question to these agencies for a more detailed answer.

The information contained within DMURS relating to junction tightening was developed using information gleaned from several different resources. Analysis undertaken by the Road Safety Authority Free Speed Surveys confirmed that tighter junctions are just one of a number of physical measures that can be put in place to lower speed limits and increase the safety of all road users. The Manual for Streets (2007) and Manual for Streets 2 (2010), both of which were published by the Charted institute of Highways and Transportation in the UK, were also used as reference material during the development of DMURS. Both documents recommend the tightening of junctions in order to improve safety, reduce vehicle speed and prioritize pedestrian and cyclists. ",

        "answerText": " Minister for Transport  The Government is committed to achieving modal shift in transport and increasing the number of Active Travel journeys over the coming years. This is evidenced in both the commitments made under various policy documents including the Programme for Government, the Climate Action Plan and my Department's National Sustainable Mobility Plan (SMP), as well as the significant increase in funding for walking and cycling measures over the past six years.  As Minister for Transport, I have responsibility for policy and overall funding in relation to Active Travel. Funding is administered through the National Transport Authority (NTA), who, in partnership with local authorities, have responsibility for the selection and development of specific projects in each local authority area. They are also responsible for a number of studies and surveys aimed at assessing levels of modal shift towards walking and cycling in light of the recent increased investment in Active Travel.  In conjunction with the development of such infrastructure, the NTA carries out a Household Travel Survey annually in line with a requirement in my Department's SMP. The Survey is designed to provide a comprehensive picture of the daily travel patterns of Irish residents. The NTA also conducts the annual Canal Cordon survey which measures the mode share of vehicles and people crossing the canal into Dublin city centre.  Additionally, the Walking and Cycling Index is Ireland's largest assessment of walking, wheeling and cycling activity developed by the NTA and Sustrans. It gathers data through local information, modelling, and surveys of residents to understand usage, public support for active travel, and necessary infrastructure to encourage more walking and cycling. The index provides key insights that inform the NTA's Active Travel Investment Programme and help cities become more sustainable by reducing car reliance.  Finally, an upcoming study on the Benefits of Active Travel investment commissioned by the NTA should provide insights into the economic impact of such investment, inflation pressures and the wider benefits of funding for walking and cycling. This study is due to be published by year end.  Taken in tandem, these studies and surveys provide a comprehensive look at the impact of our investment in walking and cycling in recent years; however both the NTA and my Department are constantly seeking new opportunities to engage in such research and data-gathering with a view to strengthening our evidence base for investment decisions.

The establishment of a NSO would be transformative in our national skills intelligence landscape and is expected to deliver significant benefits, including:  • Enhanced policy decision-making, providing evidence-based insights to inform education, employment, and economic policies.  • Improved workforce planning, assisting employers and training providers in aligning skills supply with industry demands.  • Greater economic competitiveness in ensuring Ireland’s workforce remains agile and responsive to evolving market needs.  • Lifelong learning and workforce reskilling supporting continuous professional development (CPD) initiatives aligned with labour market needs.  • Collaboration to facilitate evidence-based policymaking through regular dialogue with government, industry stakeholders, and education and training providers.  • Balanced regional development in developing region-specific skills intelligence to support balanced economic development.  • Stronger international positioning, aligning Ireland’s skills intelligence capabilities with leading global standards.  • Increased public engagement - offering accessible labour market data to help individuals make informed career and education choices.  • The advancement of national and EU priorities.

        "answerText": " Minister for Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science  The OECD Ireland Skills Strategy Review (2023) recommended that Ireland strengthen incentives for employers to participate in lifelong learning. My Department is working closely with Skillnet Ireland on a scheme aimed specifically at supporting SMEs in this respect. The aim of the scheme is to support small and medium enterprises to upskill and reskill in areas of critical skills needs, to ensure that the workforce has the necessary skills for the future. As SMEs often lack the resources (time, money, HR function etc) to help their staff upskill and reskill, it is important that they are supported to ensure that this happens.  However, current training supports provided to businesses through the National Training Fund (NTF) include targeted and flexible upskilling options under SOLAS’ Skills to Advance initiative. These options include micro-qualifications to ensure that enterprises can respond to the rapidly changing world of work, advances in technology and tackling climate change.  With funding from the NTF, Skillnet Ireland supports over 26,000 businesses and 97,000 employees each year through its 69 Skillnet Business Networks. Skillnet Ireland engages with industry stakeholders to ensure that skills and talent provisions reflect the needs of businesses and their workers.  The NTF also contributes to Enterprise Ireland’s training on Leadership and Management Development programmes.  Current NTF funding to the HEA includes provision for Springboard+ which provides free and heavily subsidised upskilling and reskilling opportunities through higher education. Springboard+ courses are provided in independent and private HEIs. In order for a course to be considered for Springboard+ funding, the course provider must (among other things) demonstrate clear evidence of engagement with enterprise and industry partners.  In relation to the NTF Act, minimal amendments are required to ensure that the new NTF expenditure announced in Budget 2025 can be provided from 2026 onwards. It is important to note that the purposes of the NTF will not be amended, which are to raise the skills of those in employment, provide training to those who wish to acquire skills to take up employment and provide information in relation to skills requirements in the economy.

The main support available to assist students with the cost of attending higher education is the Student Grant Scheme. Under the Scheme, grant assistance is awarded to eligible students attending an approved course in an approved institution who meet the prescribed conditions of funding, including those relating to nationality, residency, previous academic attainment and means.  The definition of an approved institution is set out in Section 7 of the Student Support Act 2011 and Regulation 3 of the Student Support Regulations/Student Part-Time Fee Regulations for Specified Undergraduate Courses 2025.  The list of approved institutions is predominantly populated by publicly funded institutions. While there are a small number of private institutions who have certain courses approved on the list, these are categorised as ‘not for profit’ institutions.  In the context of limited public funding and competing priorities, student support funding is currently prioritised towards full-time students undertaking study in approved publicly funded institutions and part-time fee supports for specified undergraduate courses.  It is open to higher education institutions that operate on a 'for profit' basis to use their own resources to provide financial supports to any of their students that they consider to be in particular need.  Student Grant Schemes are reviewed on an annual basis. Any expansion to a scheme would require consent of the Minister for Public Expenditure, Infrastructure, Public Service Reform and Digitalisation. The Deputy will appreciate that the funding allocation for student supports is determined in the context of the overall estimates and budgetary process undertaken by all Government Departments having regard to overall resource constraints and other competing demands.
