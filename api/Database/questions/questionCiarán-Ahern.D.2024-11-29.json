        "answerText": " Minister for Climate, Energy and the Environment  Earlier this year Government approved the development of a State-led strategic gas emergency reserve. The strategic reserve will be in the form of a Floating Storage and Regasification Unit (FSRU), to be owned on behalf of the State by the system operator Gas Networks Ireland (GNI), and will be located in Cahiracon, Co. Clare, along the Shannon estuary.  The delivery of a temporary gas reserve is critical to Ireland's energy security as we transition to indigenous, clean renewable energy. Modelling carried out as part of the 'Energy Security in Ireland to 2030' report found that Ireland does not have adequate resilience in case of a major disruption to our subsea gas import pipelines and does not meet minimum EU standards in this area. The strategic reserve will ensure that we meet this standard in the most cost-effective and achievable manner available to the State, while enhancing our energy security and resilience.  The strategic gas emergency reserve is not intended for commercial use. The liquefied natural gas (LNG) will be held in reserve for use in the event of a significant disruption to gas supplies and will be divested when no longer required to secure Ireland's energy systems. The operation of the strategic gas emergency reserve will be underpinned by both policy and legislation that my Department is currently developing and will be progressed as a matter of priority. ",

It is expected that a Memorandum for Government seeking permission to draft the associated General Scheme for this Bill will be brought to Cabinet next year. It is anticipated the General Scheme will undergo pre-legislative scrutiny following this Government Decision.  The strategic gas emergency reserve will provide the necessary resilience to our energy system in a manner that:  • does not inadvertently increase gas demand by increasing the supply available on the market;  • will avoid the risk to fossil fuel lock-in or stranded fossil fuel asset;  • is designed to be divested when no longer required; and  • is compatible with the Climate Action and Low Carbon Development Act ",

        "answerText": " Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage  The Building Regulations apply generally to new buildings and to existing buildings which undergo an extension, a material alteration or a material change of use. These Regulations set out the minimum legal performance requirements for the construction of new buildings and certain works to existing buildings.  The primary responsibility for compliance with the requirements of the Building Regulations rests with the designers, builders and owners of buildings. Enforcement of the Building Regulations is delegated under the Building Control Act 1990 as amended to the local building control authorities (i.e. the 31 local authorities) who are independent in the exercise of their statutory powers. Interpretation of the legislation is ultimately a matter for the Courts. My Department has no function in assessing whether any particular works comply with the Building Regulations.  Building regulations do not apply to the management, operation or maintenance of existing buildings. However, in general, matters that arise during building works are a matter for resolution between the contracting parties involved: the homeowner, the builder, the developer and/or their respective insurers, structural guarantee or warranty scheme. While my Department has overall responsibility for establishing and maintaining an effective regulatory framework for building standards and building control, it has no general statutory role in resolving matters arising in privately owned buildings, including dwellings.

        "answerText": " Minister for Climate, Energy and the Environment  Grid scale electricity storage systems including battery electricity storage systems play a vital role in Irelands energy transition by maximising the incorporation of renewable generated electricity, providing targeted demand flexibility to the grid, supporting grid build out and ensuring the proper functioning of the grid through system services.  As of November 2025, the system operators, EirGrid and ESB Networks, report that electricity storage systems with the capacity of 1,048 MW (megawatts) are connected to the grid network. One pumped hydro storage facility, Turlough Hill Co. Wicklow, accounts for 292 MW of this capacity with the remaining 756 MW provided by Stationary Battery Energy Storage Systems (S-BESS).  By comparison, approximately 4,350 MW of gas generation, 5,100 MW of wind generation and 2,100 MW of solar generation are connected to the grid network.  As of November, no additional electricity storage capacity have been reported as energised onto either the transmission or distribution grids in 2025, however, EirGrid currently has 28 storage projects totalling 1,698 MW with connection contracts pending fulfilment.  In support of Electricity Storage Systems, my Department published the Electricity Storage Policy Framework for Ireland in July 2024, which included 10 Government actions.  Action 6 of the policy framework supports the immediate procurement of 500 MW of Demand Flexibility Products by ESB Networks and 500 MW of Long Duration Electricity Storage (LDES) by EirGrid to meet specific network needs.  The first round of the ESB Networks Demand Flexibility Product, contracting 109MW of flexible capacity across 16 locations on to the distribution grid, is now live.  The EirGrid Long Duration Electricity Storage (LDES) product will incorporate electricity storage technologies with a minimum duration of 4 hours. The first contracts are expected to be signed in 2027, with the assets delivered by end of 2030. ",

        "answerText": " Minister for Climate, Energy and the Environment  I propose to take Questions Nos. 199 and 200 together.  The Programme for Government 2025 reaffirmed Ireland’s targets of 80% of electricity demand to be met by renewable energy sources, including a target of 9GW of onshore wind generation and 8 GW of solar generation as part of a strategy to decarbonise our power system.  SEAI has calculated the share of energy from renewable sources in gross final consumption of electricity was 41.4% in 2024, up from 40.4% in 2023. Furthermore, according to SEAI, over the last 12 months, 48.3% of indigenous electricity generation was from renewables.  EirGrid's Monthly Renewables Release for November provides provisional data showing 41% of electricity was generated from renewables, up from 34% in the same month last year. The majority of this renewable electricity came from wind with it accounting for 35% of all electricity used last month.  Ireland currently has circa 7.7 GW of installed renewable generation capacity, up from 1.2 GW in 2015. Onshore wind is the largest contributor with circa 5.1 GW of capacity. This is complemented by circa 1.7 GW of solar PV capacity, with Small-scale, Mini and Microgeneration, along with hydro, biomass, and other small sources contributing the remainder. Approximately 1.3 GW of this total has been added in 2025.  Government policy is focused on maintaining this momentum through 2026 and beyond as we deliver on the transition to a renewables led system. This will involve the development of a balanced portfolio of technologies, including solar, storage and flexibility services to complement other measures such as demand-side response, network development and interconnection to ensure a safe and secure electricity system with increased levels of renewables.  This will require unprecedented levels of investment in renewable electricity generation development and in the infrastructure required to expand and strengthen our electricity grid.  The Accelerating Renewable Electricity Taskforce was established to accelerate and increase the deployment of onshore renewable electricity generation by ensuring that barriers to the implementation of policies are removed or minimised to the greatest extent possible.

        "answerText": " Minister for Climate, Energy and the Environment  I propose to take Questions Nos. 199 and 200 together.  The Programme for Government 2025 reaffirmed Ireland’s targets of 80% of electricity demand to be met by renewable energy sources, including a target of 9GW of onshore wind generation and 8 GW of solar generation as part of a strategy to decarbonise our power system.  SEAI has calculated the share of energy from renewable sources in gross final consumption of electricity was 41.4% in 2024, up from 40.4% in 2023. Furthermore, according to SEAI, over the last 12 months, 48.3% of indigenous electricity generation was from renewables.  EirGrid's Monthly Renewables Release for November provides provisional data showing 41% of electricity was generated from renewables, up from 34% in the same month last year. The majority of this renewable electricity came from wind with it accounting for 35% of all electricity used last month.  Ireland currently has circa 7.7 GW of installed renewable generation capacity, up from 1.2 GW in 2015. Onshore wind is the largest contributor with circa 5.1 GW of capacity. This is complemented by circa 1.7 GW of solar PV capacity, with Small-scale, Mini and Microgeneration, along with hydro, biomass, and other small sources contributing the remainder. Approximately 1.3 GW of this total has been added in 2025.  Government policy is focused on maintaining this momentum through 2026 and beyond as we deliver on the transition to a renewables led system. This will involve the development of a balanced portfolio of technologies, including solar, storage and flexibility services to complement other measures such as demand-side response, network development and interconnection to ensure a safe and secure electricity system with increased levels of renewables.  This will require unprecedented levels of investment in renewable electricity generation development and in the infrastructure required to expand and strengthen our electricity grid.  The Accelerating Renewable Electricity Taskforce was established to accelerate and increase the deployment of onshore renewable electricity generation by ensuring that barriers to the implementation of policies are removed or minimised to the greatest extent possible.

To achieve this, EirGrid must balance supply and demand now and forecast how to do so in the future. EirGrid’s All-Island Resource Adequacy Assessment looks at the balance between electricity demand and supply in Ireland for the next 10 years, which includes a ten-year demand forecast.  In EirGrid’s most recent published assessment, the All-Island Resource Adequacy Assessment 2025-2034, published in May 2025, the peak demand from the ramp-up of contracted data centres and new technology loads in 2025 is expected to be around 13% higher compared to the previous year, 2024. The same assessment indicates that peak demand from contracted data centres and new technology loads in 2026 is expected to be around 12% higher in 2026 compared to 2025.  Over the next five years, i.e. from 2025 to 2030, peak demand from the ramp-up of contracted data centres and new technology loads is expected to grow by a cumulative 33%.  Ireland has attracted the best data centre and tech companies in the world. This is a really important relationship, and the Government continues to work with the sector towards a secure and decarbonised energy future. Data centres are central to Ireland’s economic and digital future as they are a key part of our value proposition for foreign direct investment and the associated employment and are central to Ireland’s economic and digital future.

      "question": {
        "answerText": " Tánaiste and Minister for Finance  Firstly, it is important to understand that the Irish economy at present remains reliant on fossil fuels for the majority of its energy inputs – so economic activity in Ireland at present involves fossil fuel consumption for over 80% of its energy needs.  In regard to financial services firms’ involvement in supporting fossil fuel investments in Ireland, I would respond by saying that addressing climate risks and supporting the transition to a carbon-neutral economy is a key part of financial regulation: the Central Bank of Ireland’s Strategy for 2025-27 sets this out clearly.  Governor Makhlouf has re-affirmed the Central Bank’s commitment to addressing the macro-financial risks arising from climate change and enabling finance for sustainable and transitioning activities.  As a major funds jurisdiction, Central Bank figures for end September 2025 show that approximately €2 trillion of funds authorised in Ireland are made up of investments promoting a sustainable objective (Article 8 SFDR) or with a sustainable objective (Article 9 SFDR) - and this is approximately 35% of the total authorised Irish funds.  The Central Bank has also considered the importance of transition planning for the financial sector and published an Information Note on this important issue earlier this year.  It is important to note that while the EU and Ireland are on a path to net zero emission by 2050, at present our economies are still dependent on carbon emitting fuels. Investment is needed in high emission sectors in order for them to decarbonise.  The development of the Sustainable Finance Disclosures Regulation (SFDR) has brought sustainability and Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) features into the disclosures space. This month, the European Commission has undertaken a significant review of the Sustainable Finance Disclosures Regulation framework. The aim is to simplify the regime, while supporting and incentivising investment towards credible transition and sustainable products.  The European Commission has published a proposal centred on the development of product categories which will have specific contribution requirements; more than 70% of assets are aligned with that category and there are to be certain standardised exclusions for certain fossil fuel activities. The new proposal aims to significantly restrict the use of sustainability terminology in names and marketing materials, reserving them for those who meet the strict criteria of the mandated categories. This change seeks to improve clarity and transparency, combating the misuse and misleading claims, ensuring that these labels more accurately reflect genuine sustainability commitments.  Finally, with respect to State investments, the Fossil Fuel Divestment Act 2018 has been in place since December 2018. Pursuant to the terms of the Act, the National Treasury Management Agency must, inter alia, endeavour to ensure that the assets of the Ireland Strategic Investment Fund (ISIF) are not directly invested in any undertaking that generates 20% or more of its turnover from the exploration for or extraction or refinement of a fossil fuel (coal, oil, natural gas, peat or any derivative thereof intended for use in the production of energy by combustion).  ISIF has developed a list of fossil fuel companies in which it will not invest, as determined by criteria within the Act. This list is updated on a semi-annual basis in line with methodology which is aligned to the Act and is available on ISIF’s website. ISIF’s Climate Investment Strategy seeks to fund climate positive initiatives which support Ireland’s transition to a Net Zero low-carbon economy.  Section 31 of the Future Ireland Fund and Infrastructure, Climate and Nature Fund Act 2024, builds upon the Fossil Fuel Divestment Act 2018, requiring the NTMA to endeavour to ensure that the assets of either the Future Ireland Fund (FIF) or Infrastructure, Climate and Nature Fund (ICNF), are not directly invested in a fossil fuel undertaking.

The range of current work being undertaken across Government in the context of the Land Use Review will supplant and overtake the existing strategy in this area.  As indicated previously, my Department has in the meantime made very substantial progress on issues of habitat and wildlife protection, which are tied closely to landscape. In particular, I would emphasise the 4th National Biodiversity Action Plan, which sets the national biodiversity agenda for the period 2023-2030 and aims to deliver the transformative changes required to the ways in which we value and protect nature. This, along the Nature Restoration Law ratified recently by the European Parliament, will continue to support the delivery of national nature, water, landscape and climate objectives, while at the same time realising co-benefits for value creation in rural economies and communities.

        "answerText": " Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage  The Review of the National Parks and Wildlife Service (NPWS) 2021 set out a clear and ambitious roadmap for strengthening the State’s capacity to protect and manage our natural heritage. Implementation of those recommendations has been pursued with sustained focus and urgency across my Department and the NPWS.  In respect of Recommendation No. 11, which calls for the development of detailed operating procedures and Memoranda of Understanding with key partner agencies, substantial and measurable progress has been achieved. The NPWS already has over 30 Memoranda of Understanding and formal cooperative arrangements in place across the public, voluntary and community sectors, reflecting a sustained commitment to clarity of functions, consistency of approach, and coordinated delivery.  These instruments are not simply formalities, they provide clear governance frameworks, defined statutory interfaces, and practical protocols for engagement between agencies whose mandates intersect in complex environmental and marine contexts.  Each of these are being designed to:  • Clearly delineate the statutory functions of NPWS and the partner body, ensuring there is no ambiguity in responsibilities.  • Set out structured channels of interaction, covering communication pathways, timelines, consultation requirements, and escalation points.  • Provide for coherent scientific and ecological input, ensuring NPWS expertise is integrated early and consistently into planning, licensing and assessment processes.  • Support efficient case management, including procedures for data sharing, joint assessments where appropriate, and coordinated responses to complex applications.  These strengthened arrangements reflect the evolving environmental and marine governance landscape, and are essential to ensuring all State bodies with roles in environmental protection, marine regulation, scientific research and planning operate in a fully aligned and mutually reinforcing manner.  This inter-agency work complements the broader transformation underway within NPWS, including enhanced governance structures, expanded scientific capacity, and systematic implementation of the entire suite of recommendations from the 2021 Review.

        "answerText": " Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage  Under the EU Directive 2009/147/EC, the ‘Birds Directive’, member states are required to classify the most suitable territories as Special Protection Areas (SPAs) for the conservation of those species listed in Annex I of the Directive and for regularly occurring migratory species. The National Parks and Wildlife Service (NPWS) of my Department has regard to the obligations of Article 4 of the Birds Directive when identifying and classifying “the most suitable territories in number and size as special protection areas” for species listed in Annex I of the Directive and for regularly occurring migratory species.  Ireland’s recently identified marine Important Bird and Biodiversity Areas (IBAs), as characterised by BirdLife (BL) International and BirdWatch Ireland (BWI), are derived by the application of specific IBA selection criteria, which do not equate directly to Birds Directive obligations. It would be inappropriate to assume that all seabird IBAs warrant classification as SPAs, as the criteria driving the IBA process and the SPA process are different. Notwithstanding this, the NPWS and BL/BWI used much of the same data in the two respective analyses and some of the marine areas characterised as IBAs are already SPAs or candidate SPAs for marine birds, and more may be in due course.  The NPWS is now in the final stages of the scientific analysis required to classify its most suitable marine territories, nationally, as SPAs. The SPA Network will not include every foraging area for every species listed as a Special Conservation Interest at every SPA, given the far-reaching foraging behaviour of many of these species and will focus on “the most suitable territories”. The first of the new marine SPAs to be notified publicly is the candidate North-West Irish Sea SPA. When the final marine SPAs have been classified, the NPWS will be in a position to demonstrate the coherence of the marine SPA Network, species by species. ",

For the purposes of the means-test, from application stage through the lifetime of a claim, an applicant must provide full and up to date details of any income(s), asset(s), savings and investment(s) held, including any changes that occur.  Social welfare legislation provides that means tests take account of the income and assets of the person (and their spouse or partner, if applicable) applying for the relevant scheme. The means assessment includes income from sources such as employment, self-employment, occupational pensions, maintenance payments and other sources. It also includes property owned, other than the family home, and capital such as savings, shares, and other investments. Income earned under the rent-a-room tax relief scheme is exempt from the means test.  An applicant can have savings or assets of up to €20,000 and earnings of up to €200 per week from paid employment and still qualify for a full State Pension (Non-Contributory). The first €30 per week of means does not affect the rate of the pension. After that first €30, the pension is reduced by €2.50 for every €2.50 of means. If a person’s assessed weekly means is over €292.51, they will not be eligible to receive a State Pension (Non-Contributory) Pension.  I trust this clarifies the matter for the Deputy. ",

The payment continues to be paid in respect of children until their nineteenth birthday where they are in full-time education or have a disability. It is paid in respect of almost 1.3 million children.  Under current legislation Child Benefit is paid to a qualified person with whom the child is normally resident. Consequently payment is based on the residence of the child.  The rules regarding qualified persons to receive Child Benefit are outlined in Section 220 of the Social Welfare Consolidation Act, 2005, and normal residence is subject to the provisions of Article 159 of the Social Welfare (Consolidated Claims Payments and Control) Regulations, 2007 (S.I. 142/2007).  In accordance with these legislative provisions, where a qualified child resides with his or her mother, the child is deemed to be resident with the mother and with no other person. This applies even where the child’s father also resides in same household. These legislative provisions are not affected by the custody arrangements of the cohabiting parents.  It is important that our policies continue to reflect the society they were designed to serve.

The scheme is operated by the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland (SEAI) on behalf of my Department and is funded through carbon tax receipts and the European Regional Development Fund.  The scheme is available to owner-occupied homes built before 2006 where the household meets the Department of Social Protection (DSP)-payment related eligibility criteria.  The eligible DSP payments are:  • Fuel Allowance;  • Job Seeker’s Allowance for more than 6 months with a child under 7;  • Working Family Payment (previously the Family Income Supplement).  • One Parent Family Payment;  • Domiciliary Care Allowance;  • Carer’s Allowance (where you live with the person you are caring for);  • Disability Allowance for more than 6 months with a child under 7.  The information sought is an operational matter for the SEAI, an agency under the aegis of my Department. It is suggested that the Deputy contact the SEAI directly in relation to this matter. The SEAI has established a specific email address for queries from Oireachtas members so that such queries can be addressed promptly and in line with the SEAI’s objective to deliver services to the highest standards.

It was developed by my Department, in conjunction with the Department of Finance, the Strategic Banking Corporation of Ireland (SBCI), the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland (SEAI) and the European Investment Bank Group.  The scheme is available nationwide and homeowners can borrow from €5,000 to €75,000 at significantly lower rates, starting from 2.99% (pricing varies depending on the finance provider). PTSB was the first lender to join in April 2024, with AIB and Bank of Ireland joining in June 2024. In 2025, Avant Money (in partnership with An Post Money) launched under the scheme in February, and seven credit unions from the Irish League of Credit Unions began offering loans in April.  In line with the Programme for Government, in addition to expanding the number of lenders under the scheme, a key focus of my Department across 2025 has been the continued promotion of the scheme to drive uptake. The Department has engaged with the SEAI, the SBCI and several lenders to examine and identify opportunities to further promote the scheme. This also includes the progression of a marketing and communications campaign to scale up activity in the HEULS.  Loan applications are processed, validated and approved by the participating finance providers. Only loans that have been drawn down under the scheme are uploaded by the finance providers to the SBCI's reporting system. The numbers of loans drawn down are reported by SBCI to the Department on a quarterly basis. As at the end of September 2025, there were 776 loans drawn to a value of €38.3 million.  The Deputy may wish to note that as drawdown figures in certain counties mean that it could be possible to identify individual homeowners, county figures have not been disclosed. Instead, drawdown figures by region to end September 2025 are provided in the attached table.   Loan Drawdowns  ",

From 2019 to end September 2025, the SEAI schemes provided over €1.5 billion in support to homeowners for 228,350 home energy upgrades, including over 31,000 fully-funded upgrades for households at risk of energy poverty under the Warmer Homes Scheme and 17,100 heat pump installations.  Budget 2026 announced funding of €558 million from the carbon tax for the SEAI residential and community energy upgrades, including the Solar PV (photovoltaic) Scheme. This is an €89 million increase on last year’s carbon tax allocation and means that more funding than ever will be available to make homes warmer, healthier, more comfortable and less expensive to heat. This allocation is again expected to be further supplemented with additional funding, such as an allocation from the European Regional Development Fund.  The specific data requested by the Deputy, on the Better Energy Homes and National Home Energy Upgrade schemes and home energy upgrades completed to date in 2025 on a county by county basis, is an operational matter for the SEAI, an agency under the aegis of my Department. It is suggested that the Deputy contact the SEAI directly in relation to this matter.

The SEAI has provided the attached table in response to the Question raised by the Deputy. The SEAI has also provided the following additional notes on the data:  • “Apps Received” refers to the number of first approvals. When an application is successfully received, the homeowner receives a letter of offer. This column answers the question about the number of approvals per county in 2025.  • “Properties Upgraded” refers to the number of paid applications per county in 2025, so this column addresses the drawdown question.  After approval, homeowners have 8 months to complete the works. Additional time may be required if the property is selected for inspection. As a result, about 40% of applications approved in a given year are paid in the following year. Therefore, a direct comparison cannot be made between “Applications Received” and “Properties Upgraded”.  Some homeowners do not proceed after approval and do not complete the works. The SEAI has observed a conversion rate of about 88–90% in recent years.

As a commercial semi-state body, Córas Iompair Éireann (CIÉ) are responsible for the provision of pension schemes for their employees. Any correspondence received by my Department in relation to CIÉ Pension Schemes will be processed via the Department's central eCorrespondence system, with replies issued by officials in due course.  Regarding the recent engagement between CIÉ and the Trade Union Group (TUG) on the matter of the CIÉ Pension Schemes, the Department acknowledges the longstanding tradition within CIÉ of ensuring that terms and conditions of employees, which include pension provision, are negotiated collectively with recognised Trade Unions.  I welcome the constructive and collaborative approach of the Trade Union Group and CIÉ management in reaching agreement on a pathway forward, which is aimed at balancing the objectives of supporting the future sustainability of the schemes, protecting existing benefits for members of the scheme (including pensioners), and contributing to the overall financial stability of the CIÉ Group.  I acknowledge the positive outcome from the ballot held on the CIÉ Pension Proposal for both Schemes, which was agreed by CIÉ and the TUG in May of this year.  In line with the appropriate processes and compliance with all applicable requirements, my Department will continue to engage with CIÉ as well as financial advisors at NewERA, the Pensions Authority and the Department of Public Expenditure, Infrastructure, Public Services, Reform and Digitalisation on the next steps in progressing the agreement and bringing CIÉ pensions onto a more stable footing for the benefit of active, and retired scheme members.  Decisions regarding pension increases are ultimately a matter for the CIÉ Board as informed by actuarial advice and is subject to requirements imposed by statute and scheme rules. Accordingly, I have referred this aspect of the Deputy's question to CIÉ for direct reply. Please advise my private office if you do not receive a reply within ten working days. ",

Traders in Ireland are free to set and change their prices for goods and services, based on demand, once they do so independently and in line with consumer protection legislation.  Dynamic pricing is a common practice in sectors such as the airline and hotel industry, where prices vary based on demand and timing. The practice is not prohibited if it complies with consumer protection law.  Consumer law requires traders to provide certain information to consumers before purchase. This includes the total price, inclusive of taxes and fees, allowing consumers to make the informed decision in advance of the sale, whether to purchase or not.  Consumer law prohibits also businesses from engaging in misleading, aggressive, or unfair commercial practices. A commercial practice is regarded as misleading if the trader does not act in good faith and misleads a consumer into taking an action that they may otherwise not take. The Act also prohibits traders from making a false representation that a product is available only for a limited time, or on particular terms for a limited time.  The Competition and Consumer Protection Commission (CCPC) is the independent statutory body responsible for the promotion and enforcement of competition and consumer law. It monitors compliance across all sectors of the market, including travel, and investigates potential breaches, prohibited practices and offences.  It is important to note that the CCPC is not a price regulator and as such has no rule in the setting, reviewing or approving price increases across the economy.  As an independent body, when the CCPC receives complaints on pricing, it assesses them to see if they indicate a possible breach of one of the areas of competition or consumer protection law that it is tasked with enforcing and then determines the course of action required.

Traders in Ireland are free to set and change their prices for goods and services, based on demand, once they do so independently and in line with consumer protection legislation.  Dynamic pricing is a common practice in sectors such as the airline and hotel industry, where prices vary based on demand and timing. The practice is not prohibited if it complies with consumer protection law.  Consumer law requires traders to provide certain information to consumers before purchase. This includes the total price, inclusive of taxes and fees, allowing consumers to make the informed decision in advance of the sale, whether to purchase or not.  Consumer law prohibits also businesses from engaging in misleading, aggressive, or unfair commercial practices. A commercial practice is regarded as misleading if the trader does not act in good faith and misleads a consumer into taking an action that they may otherwise not take. The Act also prohibits traders from making a false representation that a product is available only for a limited time, or on particular terms for a limited time.  The Competition and Consumer Protection Commission (CCPC) is the independent statutory body responsible for the promotion and enforcement of competition and consumer law. It monitors compliance across all sectors of the market, including travel, and investigates potential breaches, prohibited practices and offences.  It is important to note that the CCPC is not a price regulator and as such has no rule in the setting, reviewing or approving price increases across the economy.  As an independent body, when the CCPC receives complaints on pricing, it assesses them to see if they indicate a possible breach of one of the areas of competition or consumer protection law that it is tasked with enforcing and then determines the course of action required.

        "answerText": " Minister for Children, Disability and Equality  The Access and Inclusion Model (AIM) is a model of supports designed to ensure that children with additional needs or a disability can access the Early Childhood Care and Education (ECCE) Programme. Access to AIM is based on the needs of the individual child, in the context of the pre-school setting, and does not require a diagnosis.  AIM Level 7 support enables providers to reduce the child-to-adult ratio in the pre-school room or to fund an extra staff member as a shared resource with other children in the ECCE setting. In recognition of best practice in this area, this support is designed to improve inclusion and ensure meaningful participation of all children in the room.  The ‘First 5’ whole-of-government strategy (2019) committed to the phased extension of AIM, a commitment reaffirmed by the findings of an independent end-of-year-three evaluation. Participants in the evaluation supported proposals that AIM be scaled up and were keen to see the extension of AIM support to hours outside the ECCE entitlement. Based on the evaluation AIM is now being extended on a phased basis as funding becomes available.  As a first step in this extension, all AIM targeted supports have, since September 2024, been available to ECCE children beyond the time that they spend in the ECCE programme, all year round. Children can now access these supports for up to an additional 3 hours per day during the ECCE term and up to 6 hours per day outside of the ECCE term (in holiday periods).  The child referenced is currently in receipt of 15 hours of Aim Standard per week while attending the ECCE programme and is also in receipt of an additional 15 hours of Aim Plus per week for hours attending outside of ECCE.  For the weeks that ECCE is not available 30 hours of non-term funding have been approved for the child.  The Pobal Early Years Specialist has previously engaged with both the service provider and the legal guardian, clarifying that the maximum allowable hours under the AIM programme have been awarded to the child.  It is intended that over time, all children with additional needs in early learning and childcare services will have access to AIM supports. The next phase of expansion focuses on a redesign of AIM for children under three, to meet the specific needs of this younger cohort. Consideration will then be given to an extension of AIM for children attending school-age childcare.  An action plan has been developed to respond to other areas for improvement including increasing awareness of AIM, streamlining the application process and strengthening support for autistic children. A key step taken in this regard is the 2024 publication of Introductory Guidelines to Support the Inclusion of Autistic Children in Early Learning and Care, School-Age Childcare and Childminding Settings, with the support of ASIAM.  While the Department oversees AIM, early learning and childcare providers are private entities and responsible for their own admissions policies, which are outside the Department’s remit. Parents and carers experiencing challenges in accessing early learning and childcare supports are encouraged to contact their local City or County Childcare Committee, who can provide advice and guidance on available options in their area. Contact details are available at: www.gov.ie/childcarecommittee. ",

        "answerText": " Minister for Climate, Energy and the Environment  I propose to take Questions Nos. 19, 33 and 34 together.  The Warmer Homes Scheme aims to improve the energy efficiency and warmth of homes owned by people at risk of energy poverty by providing fully funded retrofits. The scheme is operated by the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland (SEAI) on behalf of my Department and is funded through carbon tax receipts and the European Regional Development Fund.  Increased awareness of the multiple benefits of retrofit and improvements to the Warmer Homes Scheme is driving increased levels of demand for the scheme with over 45,700 applications received over the period from January 2022 to end October 2025. The increase in depth of retrofit to an average value of just over €29,000 per home is also reflected in the waiting times as more significant works take a longer time per home to complete.  The average waiting time under the Warmer Homes Scheme, from application to completion of upgrade works, to date in 2025 was 21 months for the worst performing homes and 22 months for better performing homes. The represents a decrease from an average of 26 months for homes completed in 2022.  The reduction in waiting times follows a range of measures introduced by my Department and the SEAI. These include the allocation of additional staff to the Warmer Homes Scheme; a significantly increased budget allocation; active contract engagement and management by the SEAI to increase contractor output; as well as actions to address ongoing supply chain pressures. The SEAI are currently re-tendering for a new, expanded contractor panel for the scheme. This new tender will make it easier for successful contractors to engage sub-contractors and will enable a further significant scale-up in delivery of the scheme.  The SEAI publish indicative wait times on their website for each stage of the process. This is available here: [ Warmer Homes Scheme waiting times ]  The average waiting time and homes completed for the Warmer Home Scheme from January 2025 to end of October 2025, and for each of the past three years, is set out in the table below:        Year      2022      2023      2024      2025 Jan-Oct        Wait Times     26    20    P1 Homes= 18  P2 Homes= 19    P1 Homes=21  P2 Homes=22       Homes Completed     4,264    5,897    7,743    6,686       The specific information requested by the Deputy in relation to waiting times and homes completed on a county by county basis, are operational matters and are not routinely supplied by the SEAI to my Department. It is suggested that the Deputy contact the SEAI directly in relation to these matters. The SEAI has established a specific email address for queries from Oireachtas members so that such queries can be addressed promptly and in line with the SEAI’s objective to deliver services to the highest standards. The email address is oireachtas@seai.ie.  Delivering free energy upgrades to low-income households and reducing the waiting times for the Warmer Homes Scheme is a key priority for my Department and the SEAI. My officials continue to work with the SEAI to maximise and accelerate the output of fully-funded energy upgrades provided under this important scheme. ",

        "answerText": " Minister for Social Protection  The death of a child is always a tragedy and the difficulties that parents and families experience as a result should not be underestimated.  The Department recognises the need for a transition period during which people can grieve and plan for a life following the death of a family member. If a person is in receipt of a primary social welfare payment which includes a Child Support Payment and, tragically, that child dies, the Child Support Payment will continue for six weeks after the child's death.  Whilst the Department is appreciative of the difficulties families face in such circumstances, currently there is no provision to pay Child Benefit after the death of a child. The Child Benefit payment ceases once the Department is notified of the death.  Our records show that there were 171 children in receipt of Child Benefit who sadly passed away during 2024.  Assuming that each child was a single birth, i.e. the parents were in receipt of €140 per month in Child Benefit, the approximate costs for continuance of payment for six months and a year respectively after their passing is shown in the table below.      Number of Beneficiaries      Monthly cost at rate of €140/month      6 month cost (€)      12 month cost (€)       171    €23,940    €143,640    €287,280       Where appropriate, the Department also provide Additional Needs Payments as part of the Supplementary Welfare Allowance scheme, to help meet essential expenses that a person cannot pay from their weekly income or other personal and household resources. An application can also be made under the scheme for assistance with funeral and burial expenses.  Both the Child Support Payment and Additional Needs Payment are targeted measures designed to assist customers experiencing financial difficulty. In contrast, Child Benefit is a universal payment which is not dependant on means or PRSI contributions.  The Department regularly reviews all of its schemes in order to ensure that they are still delivering on their policy aims and objectives. Any changes to Child Benefit would have to be considered in a wider policy and budgetary context.  I trust this clarifies the position for the deputy. ",
