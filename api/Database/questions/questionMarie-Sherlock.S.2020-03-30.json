        "answerText": " Tánaiste and Minister for Finance  The VAT rating of goods and services is subject to the requirements of the EU VAT Directive with which Irish VAT law is obliged to comply. In general, the Directive provides that all goods and services are liable to VAT at the standard rate unless they fall within the categories of goods and services listed in Annex III, in respect of which Member States may apply a lower rate. Breastfeeding pumps and other breastfeeding equipment are not included in the categories of goods and services specified in the Directive, and so it is not possible to apply a lower VAT rate to breast pumps and attachments and they are liable to VAT at the standard rate.  As the Deputy will be aware any changes in relation to the VAT Directive require unanimity. The last revision to Annex III of the VAT Directive was agreed to in April 2022 after a four year negotiation process. No further change to Annex III is expected at this time. ",

As a result, many hospitals have introduced reduced rate parking for long-term patients and visitors for whom the payment of the full rate would cause hardship, and all hospitals that charge for parking have a fixed maximum daily rate. The majority of hospitals have some form of exemption or allowances in place such as the option of flexible day passes or multi-trip entry passes for regular hospital attenders, and various concessions based on the type of inpatient.  The Programme for Government 2025 – Securing Ireland’s Future, makes a commitment to explore further ways to reduce hospital car parking charges. This is a reflection of the Government’s appreciation of the financial challenge that can be faced by people in meeting these expenses, in particular where they are frequent users of hospital services. Accordingly, in line with this commitment, the HSE continues to keep all fees and concessions under review, in order to progress any opportunities that will ease the burden for those most affected.

The proposal has been reviewed by the Department in line with the Programme for Government and the Infrastructure Guidelines and in the context of Project Ireland 2040 and other capital demands. Unfortunately, at this time, there is no funding available to fund a project of this size.  I am acutely aware of the pressures that artists and creatives face in finding suitable workspaces. The lack of space has been a significant barrier for artists, limiting their ability to create and exhibit work. That is why in 2023 the Department allocated €3m in funding to Space to Create, an initiative that aims to provide up to sixty artist workspaces in Dublin City, in partnership with Dublin City Council. Work is ongoing with Dublin City Council to deliver the spaces identified under this scheme.  In addition, the Department launched the Artist Workspaces Scheme in June 2024. This is a €6 million pilot capital funding scheme for Local Authorities to increase the provision of artists’ workspaces across Ireland.  The primary focus of this pilot scheme is to provide funding to local authorities to enable them to provide additional capacity and availability of artist workspaces in their regions on a sustainable basis.  Local authorities are invited to propose projects which can accommodate and address the demand for artist workspaces in their regions and produce workspaces that are fit for purpose, design focused and accessible. Capital grants up to a maximum of €300,000 are available to densely populated Local Authority areas, with capital grants up to a maximum of €150,000 available to the remaining Local Authorities. ",

      "question": {
        "answerText": " Minister for Health  The Dental Treatment Services Scheme (DTSS) provides oral healthcare, free of charge, to medical card holders aged 16 and over. Services available annually and on demand include an examination including preventative elements, two fillings, extractions, and a scale and polish. More complex care, such as dentures, additional fillings and a broader range of treatments for patients with additional needs and high-risk patients, are available subject to the approval of the local HSE Principal Dental Surgeon. A package of measures was introduced in 2022 to expand the care available under the Scheme and significantly increase the fees paid to contractors.  These measures are having an impact, with access to care continuing to increase each year since they were introduced. In 2025, over 240,000 additional treatments were provided under the DTSS, supporting over 50,000 extra patients compared with 2022. Fees paid to dentists for DTSS care are now aligned with other European countries which provide comparable public dental care, noting that many European countries, especially in the southern and eastern regions, don’t have any scheme in place for adults, which is free at point of access.  Having been suspended in 2010, the scale and polish item was re-introduced for all medical card patients in 2022 along with an expansion of the oral examination to include provision of preventative advice, using €10 million awarded in Budget 2022. The cost of providing free dental care at the pre 2010 level would depend on a number of factors, including the underlying oral health of the population and the level of take-up of such services.  At present, the HSE Oral Healthcare Service aims to provide an oral examination and necessary treatment for children at up to three intervals, targeting ages approximating to second and sixth class and, in some cases, fourth class. However, there are access issues within this service at present and the HSE has had to prioritise patient groups, to ensure emergency care remains available for all eligible HSE patients. Within the three childhood appointments, the sixth-class appointment is currently prioritised by HSE. This is to ensure that children receive preventative fissure sealants on their permanent molars and, for those children who require it, a referral for orthodontics assessment. It is important to note that the numbers of examination appointments being provided by HSE to their target groups is increasing.  In 2022 just over 99,000 such appointments were provided nationally. Last year, this increased to almost 107,000 appointments provided.To support the HSE to provide care under the current model of service, additional investment of €2m was made in Budget 2025 to, among other things, enable the HSE to recruit 15 additional whole-time equivalents (WTEs) in oral healthcare. Furthermore, the HSE has sanctioned the filling of 34.7 existing WTE vacancies across dental and orthodontic services. This additional capacity supports access to HSE dental clinics for children and special care patients.  In the longer term, the Government is committed to reforming oral healthcare services, including the DTSS, through the implementation of the service reforms set out in the National Oral Health Policy (NOHP), Smile Agus Sláinte. The Policy also contains a range of strategic workforce planning actions to increase national workforce capacity, in support of improving patient access to care. The Programme for Government contains commitments to implement the National Oral Health Policy, reform oral healthcare services for medical card holders and address workforce capacity.  The National Oral Health Policy has two key goals: to provide the supports to enable every individual to achieve their personal best oral health; and to reduce oral health inequalities across the population, by enabling vulnerable patients to access oral healthcare and improve their oral health. These new oral healthcare services will be prevention-focused and will be tailored to each age group across the life course from birth to old age. Patients with additional needs will be supported to mainstream to a local general dental practice of their choosing as much as is possible, while the HSE Oral Healthcare Service will reorient to provide the additional time, technology and skills to provide care for those who can't receive the entirety of their care in a general dental practice.  The HSE will also develop the necessary models of care, clinical guidelines and care pathways to support provision of services.The implementation plan for the first phase of the Policy is currently being finalised by my Department and the HSE. The plan includes reform of services for children and adult medical card holders among the initial priorities.  The Treatment Benefit Scheme funded by PRSI contributions to the Social Insurance Fund is under the remit of the Minister for Social Protection. ",

The National Council for Special Education (NCSE) advise that there are seven schools with a designation of Schools for Emotionally Disturbed Children. However, it is important to remember that a number of special schools have diversified since they were established to enrol students from their local area with varying degrees of complex needs. This diversification allows children and young people to attend their local special school without the need to travel long distances so as to receive the supports they need. For further information on special schools please see my Department's website on www.gov.ie and the NCSE website.  My department and the NCSE are committed to delivering an education system that is of the highest quality and where every child and young person feels valued and is actively supported and nurtured to reach their full potential.

The brief for this project is to provide the development of a new 500 pupil post primary school with a four class Special Education Needs (SEN) base.  The project is currently at Stage 2b of the architectural process which allows for detailed design and planning, obtaining the necessary statutory permissions and the preparation of tender documents. Le Chéile will continue to engage directly with the school authorities to keep them fully informed of progress on this important project.  In July, the Government announced a capital allocation of €7.55 billion for the Department of Education and Youth for the period 2026-2030 under the National Development Plan. As part of this NDP allocation my department will place a strong emphasis on provision for children with special educational needs, with a particular focus on meeting annual school place needs. In relation to project rollout for Large-Scale projects and Additional School Accommodation scheme projects, the approach will be to continue to maximise the capacity of the existing school estate as much as possible in the first instance and provide necessary additional capacity through targeted and prioritised project rollout over the course of 2026 to 2030 period to meet the most urgent and prioritised needs.  Government departments are currently in the process of publishing their sectoral NDP Implementation Plans. The sectoral plan for the Education and Youth sector will be published shortly and the first tranche of projects to progress to construction will be published in January. This NDP Implementation Plan will optimise outputs from the NDP allocations, with a strong focus on maximising existing school capacity, progressing priority projects where local capacity across schools in the area is insufficient, and ensuring delivery that is affordable, offers value for money, and meets functional needs.

        "answerText": " Minister for Education and Youth  The project brief is for the construction of a 16-classroom primary school, on a brownfield site, purchased from Dublin City Council.  The site is in an area of archaeological interest and abuts a Protected Structure. A number of issues arose on site early in the project, which is not unusual given the nature of a brownfield city centre site, but this led to a delay. While all parties actively engaged to discuss and resolve the issues and to reduce any risk to the programme, these unforeseen matters did lead to a delay.  In response to issues on the site the Department sanctioned the appointment of a Project Manager on the project, who has engaged with both the Design Team and Contractor to minimise project delays on the programme and ensure clear lines of communication were in operation.  Good progress was initially made following the Project Manager’s intervention in the summer of 2024 up to year end with significant visible progress being made on the structure. Since Christmas however, the project issues have intensified. The Department has had ongoing engagement with the contractor and the Design Team to resolve these issues.  As a result, the Department entered a Conciliation hearing to try reach agreement on a solution to ensure the earliest possible delivery of the school while respecting its statutory obligations.  In accordance with standard practice and contractual requirements, the conciliation process is of a confidential nature. A temporary pause on works, under the suspension of works provisions of the contract, provided an opportunity to consider outcomes from the conciliation process. A notice of suspension of works was communicated to the contractor on 23 May 2025 in accordance with the provisions of the contract.  During the suspension, the Department carefully considered the best way to deliver a school building while also respecting its statutory obligations. A notice of termination was issued under the contract on 1 July 2025 following careful consideration of the need to ensure compliance with those statutory obligations.  Department officials are in regular contact with the School Authorities, meeting approximately every 6 weeks, or more frequently when required and are committed to continuing this support for the school.  As an interim measure, the department is providing accommodation more suitable to the current needs of the school nearby in Cathal Brugha St.  The department is assessing all options open to it to expedite the delivery of a new school building, and as set out above, is in very regular contact with the school authorities.  The department will provide a further update when we have clarity surrounding the timeline for completion of the project. ",

        "answerText": " Minister for Health  As Minister for Health, I am committed to supporting our population screening programmes, which are a valuable part of our health service, enabling early treatment and care for many people, and improving the overall health of our population.  The Programme for Government commits to extending the ages for the BreastCheck Screening Programme, in line with updated standards from HIQA.  BreastCheck, the National Breast Screening Programme, currently invites women aged 50 to 69 years at regular intervals to have a screening mammogram. In Budget 2025, an additional €2.9 million was allocated to the BreastCheck programme to support the recruitment of 22 Whole Time Equivalent posts. This will assist in expanding and future-proofing the programme to meet increased demand.  I would note that any proposed changes to Ireland’s cancer screening programmes, will be facilitated through established evidence-driven protocols.  The National Screening Advisory Committee (NSAC) is the independent expert group that considers proposed changes to Ireland’s screening programmes. NSAC assesses the evidence in a robust and transparent manner and against internationally accepted criteria, before making recommendations to myself as Minister.  NSAC continues to progress work to consider the further expansion of our cancer screening programmes and has submitted several requests to the Health Information and Quality Authority (HIQA).  HIQA has commenced a Health Technology Assessment (HTA) to consider proposals for the expansion of the BreastCheck programme. This review will comprise two elements; the proposed extension of the age range eligibility to those aged 45-49 and 70-74, and also the potential introduction of a standardised breast density notification.  HTAs facilitate the assessment of relevant evidence and knowledge on the effects and consequences of healthcare technologies to guide decisions regarding the appropriate use of technology and efficient allocation of resources. They involve a multi-disciplinary assessment of the clinical, economic, ethical, legal and societal perspectives that may be impacted by the introduction of a new technology. They are time intensive and rigorous processes that must be afforded the necessary amount of time to complete, particularly so in the context of the current BreastCheck HTA which is considering three distinct areas, the potential to increase the age eligibility, to decrease the age eligibility and potential reporting of breast density.  Finally, I would emphasise that screening programmes are for people without symptoms. If anyone becomes aware of symptoms, or if they have concerns or worries, they should contact a medical professional immediately. ",

        "answerText": " Minister for Education and Youth  The Programme for Government commits to expanding the Junior Certificate School Programme (JCSP) Library Project. The JCSP Demonstration Library Project was developed in 2002 under the Early Literacy Initiative. Within the Demonstration Library Project, there are 32 professional librarians employed by the CDETB who are based in 30 schools that work as part of a network to operate the library facility. They are managed by the Senior Librarian. Librarians are responsible, together with key school staff, for drawing up and implementing library strategies to tackle the literacy difficulties experienced by many JCSP students.  In this regard, my Department continues to work in partnership with the national library service. We are exploring ways to strengthening this partnership through the library service five-year strategy published in July 2023 and the Literacy, Numeracy and Digital Literacy Strategy 2024 to 2033. The strategy was launched in May 2024, and developed between my Department and the Department of Children, Disability and Equality. The strategy is set across all stages of the learner's journey from early learning and care to post-primary school. It aims to promote the development of essential literacy, numeracy and digital literacy skills, knowledge, and dispositions with a particular focus on our learners from disadvantaged backgrounds.  The DEIS programme is a key policy initiative of Government to address concentrated educational disadvantage at school level. Currently, the DEIS programme supports almost 1,200 primary and post-primary schools, reaching approximately 260,000 students, with an annual investment of over €180 million. Budget 2026 allocates an additional €16.5 million in 2026, rising to €48 million in 2027, to support the implementation of the new DEIS Strategy and introduce the DEIS Plus scheme, which will commence in 2026.  A new DEIS Strategy, which will include a DEIS Plus scheme, will be published in Q1 2026. The DEIS Plus scheme will provide additional support to schools with the highest levels of need, in line with the Government’s commitment. It will target a cohort of schools with high concentrations of children and young people experiencing intergenerational disadvantage where there is a significant gap in outcomes and where there are barriers to those children and young people achieving their potential.  The details of the DEIS Plus scheme are currently being finalised within an overall programme of work to tackle educational disadvantage and will be outlined in the new DEIS Strategy. Future allocation of overall resources will be considered within the context of the new DEIS Strategy and the availability of resources. ",

I am conscious of the burden that this places on patients and their families.  I published the Waiting List Action Plan (WLAP) for 2025 in February, representing this Government’s continued commitment to reducing waiting times for patients and improving access to hospital care. This year's plan sets out four overarching targets focused on reducing waiting times.  With the multi annual action plan approach, we are progressing towards the ultimate vision of a public healthcare service in which everyone has timely access to high-quality scheduled care, where and when they need it.  My Department is engaging with the HSE and National Treatment Purchase Fund to develop the action plan for 2026, building on the progress delivered to date, renewing the focus on improving waiting times for patients, and considering the learnings from the challenges that arose in 2025.  In relation to the particular query raised, adult and child waiting list information by hospital, specialty, and time band is published monthly by the National Treatment Purchase Fund (NTPF) on its website: www.ntpf.ie/home/nwld.htm .  The information is now being made available through an interactive visual tool which provides users with a much-improved way of accessing and analysing waiting list information.  It should be noted that the health system does not collect the data necessary to calculate the average time to treatment of patients who have already received their care. The NTPF collects data on patients on a waiting list at a point in time.

The report provides evidence-based recommendations on the clinical effectiveness, safety, cost-effectiveness, and budget impact of the assessed technology. In general, once HIQA completes and publishes an HTA report, it is formally submitted to the Department of Health or the relevant commissioning body, for example, the HSE, as decision maker.  The process following the publication of a HIQA health technology assessment (HTA) report will be dependent on the specific technology being assessed. The conclusions and information in an HTA are advisory and form just one element informing the decision making. An HTA cannot, for example, determine if there is adequate budget available to fund a new technology. However, by including the budget impact and cost effectiveness in the HTA, the decision-maker can then assess funding options.  When the Department receives an HTA report, the advice it provides is considered in the context of a range of metrics including budget, clinical need, outcomes for patients, alternative technologies and impact of displacement of funding for existing technologies, amongst others. Decisions on policies relating to specific technologies are only made after all relevant advice and information is fully considered, including that provided by HIQA in an HTA. ",

        "answerText": " Minister of State at the Department of Education and Youth  I propose to take Questions Nos. 370 and 372 together.  Special schools support children and young people aged between 4 and 18 years of age with the most complex special educational needs and ensure positive links are established and fostered between the home, school and other agencies for these students.  The National Council for Special Education (NCSE) advise that there are seven schools with a designation of Schools for Emotionally Disturbed Children. However, it is important to remember that a number of special schools have diversified since they were established to enrol students from their local area with varying degrees of complex needs. This diversification allows children and young people to attend their local special school without the need to travel long distances so as to receive the supports they need.  The Programme for Government 2025 commits to the introduction of an Education Therapy Service (ETS). This service will begin in special schools and gradually extend to special classes and mainstream settings, ensuring that all children can access essential therapies in a timely and effective way. The allocation of €16 million in Budget 2026 will support the continued rollout of this service, including the recruitment of additional occupational therapists and speech and language therapists, along with the necessary resources and supports. This service, which will focus initially, on Occupational Therapy and Speech and Language Therapy.  These therapeutic services will provide therapeutic supports across a multi–tiered model working in a universal, targeted and individualised way to maximize every child and young person’s participation and potential in education.  This is a transformative initiative, one that will make a real difference in the lives of children and families. It is anticipated that the ETS will commence in 45 special schools at a later stage in the 2025/26 school year will be supported by a panel of 90 therapists comprising of senior and staff grade. The NCSE is currently preparing a large-scale recruitment campaign which is anticipated to go live in the coming weeks. Further roll out of the service will occur on a phased basis. The delivery of this support to the initial 45 special schools has been identified as a key benchmark in track progress, as will the subsequent rollout to additional special schools over 2026/2027 schools year.  The development and delivery of this service will be informed by detailed engagement, which is on-going, with our colleagues in the HSE and stakeholders and will build on the National Council for Special Educations’ (NCSE) work previously completed through the Educational Therapy Support Service (ETSS) and the School Inclusion Model.  In addition to the ETS, the NCSE have been developing an education -based therapy support service known as the ETSS. This service currently provides two strands of support to schools, Regional Therapy and Sustained In-School Therapy to both mainstream and special schools.  Sustained in-school support (SIT) is provided to schools for a defined period of 18-24 months in line with the School Inclusion Model. 22 schools in the Eastern region are currently availing of this service and 28 schools in the Western region will receive support under SIT from September 25.  Regional therapy support provides Teacher Professional Learning (TPL) with follow on/implementation support by NCSE therapists. The focus of this support is to build the capacity of schools and to embed the learning from TPL into their teaching practice, through In-school coaching and co-facilitation of interventions, strategies and resources, with a focus on whole school (Tier 1) and targeted/school support levels (Tier 2) of a multi-tiered system of support. Regional Therapy seminars is available nationally for the 2025/2026 school year.  My Department and the National Council for Special Education (NCSE) are committed to delivering an education system that is of the highest quality and where every child and young person feels valued and is actively supported and nurtured to reach their full potential.

        "answerText": " Minister of State at the Department of Education and Youth  This government is fully committed to supporting children with special educational needs to fulfil their full potential and the Programme for Government makes a number of commitments to deliver on this objective.  In 2026, over €3 billion will be spent supporting children with special educational needs. It will ensure that specialist capacity continues to grow by providing 3,000 specialist places. The majority of these places will be available in special classes within mainstream schools, however, a number will also be made available in special schools. It will increase our special educational posts by 860 special education teacher and over 1,700 special needs assistant (SNA) posts. This will mean we will have over 46,500 professionals dedicated to supporting students with special educational needs in our education system. This is one of the highest annual increases in posts to date and is a firm reminder of this government’s commitment to supporting students with special educational needs.  Budget 2026 has also afforded a number of new initiatives such as funding for the roll out of the Education Therapy Service (ETS) which will begin initially in special schools, the introduction of extra special education teaching hours for post-primary schools to support coordination and transition efforts and indeed a special school package to support the unique challenges these schools face.  The Department of Education and Youth and the National Council for Special Education (NCSE) will also, this year, look at the profile of existing special schools. This work will ensure children with complex educational needs can apply to their local special school and not have to travel long distances to access an appropriate education.  When a special school is established, there is an automatic allocation of a minimum of 1 teacher and 2 SNAs per class of 6 students but this is invariably increased based on the profile of needs of the students enrolled. Special schools are resourced by the NCSE based on an annual review of their enrolment and the profile of the children and young people enrolled in them. Schools may also apply to the NCSE for a review of their resource allocation. The NCSE will examine each request individually with consideration to each school's student profile.  My department actively engages with the representative bodies for special schools, in order to help to address some of these additional challenges these schools face over their mainstream counterparts.  Following close engagement with special schools, and awareness of the challenges facing special schools a number of new measures have been introduced to support special schools. Firstly, the appointment of new posts for administrative deputy principals in all special schools has been instrumental in assisting principals with leadership and management functions and to support learning and parental and community engagement.  Secondly, the allocation of 100 post-primary teaching posts to ensure a greater range of the national curriculum subjects can be taught to improve student progression and transition.  There has also been an increase in funding to ensure that the Summer Programme continues to expand for students with special educational needs.  In addition to these budgetary measures, my department is also working closely with the NCSE to further support special schools in relation to a range of issues relating to administration, curriculum and training.  My department and the NCSE will continue to support all schools including special schools to ensure we deliver an education system that is of the highest quality and where every child and young person feels valued and is actively supported and nurtured to reach their full potential.

        "answerText": " Minister of State at the Department of Education and Youth  I propose to take Questions Nos. 370 and 372 together.  Special schools support children and young people aged between 4 and 18 years of age with the most complex special educational needs and ensure positive links are established and fostered between the home, school and other agencies for these students.  The National Council for Special Education (NCSE) advise that there are seven schools with a designation of Schools for Emotionally Disturbed Children. However, it is important to remember that a number of special schools have diversified since they were established to enrol students from their local area with varying degrees of complex needs. This diversification allows children and young people to attend their local special school without the need to travel long distances so as to receive the supports they need.  The Programme for Government 2025 commits to the introduction of an Education Therapy Service (ETS). This service will begin in special schools and gradually extend to special classes and mainstream settings, ensuring that all children can access essential therapies in a timely and effective way. The allocation of €16 million in Budget 2026 will support the continued rollout of this service, including the recruitment of additional occupational therapists and speech and language therapists, along with the necessary resources and supports. This service, which will focus initially, on Occupational Therapy and Speech and Language Therapy.  These therapeutic services will provide therapeutic supports across a multi–tiered model working in a universal, targeted and individualised way to maximize every child and young person’s participation and potential in education.  This is a transformative initiative, one that will make a real difference in the lives of children and families. It is anticipated that the ETS will commence in 45 special schools at a later stage in the 2025/26 school year will be supported by a panel of 90 therapists comprising of senior and staff grade. The NCSE is currently preparing a large-scale recruitment campaign which is anticipated to go live in the coming weeks. Further roll out of the service will occur on a phased basis. The delivery of this support to the initial 45 special schools has been identified as a key benchmark in track progress, as will the subsequent rollout to additional special schools over 2026/2027 schools year.  The development and delivery of this service will be informed by detailed engagement, which is on-going, with our colleagues in the HSE and stakeholders and will build on the National Council for Special Educations’ (NCSE) work previously completed through the Educational Therapy Support Service (ETSS) and the School Inclusion Model.  In addition to the ETS, the NCSE have been developing an education -based therapy support service known as the ETSS. This service currently provides two strands of support to schools, Regional Therapy and Sustained In-School Therapy to both mainstream and special schools.  Sustained in-school support (SIT) is provided to schools for a defined period of 18-24 months in line with the School Inclusion Model. 22 schools in the Eastern region are currently availing of this service and 28 schools in the Western region will receive support under SIT from September 25.  Regional therapy support provides Teacher Professional Learning (TPL) with follow on/implementation support by NCSE therapists. The focus of this support is to build the capacity of schools and to embed the learning from TPL into their teaching practice, through In-school coaching and co-facilitation of interventions, strategies and resources, with a focus on whole school (Tier 1) and targeted/school support levels (Tier 2) of a multi-tiered system of support. Regional Therapy seminars is available nationally for the 2025/2026 school year.  My Department and the National Council for Special Education (NCSE) are committed to delivering an education system that is of the highest quality and where every child and young person feels valued and is actively supported and nurtured to reach their full potential.

Both department and NCSE officials are engaging with the school directly to address the concerns raised.  The school will continue to be prioritised for support by the NCSE, the National Educational Psychological Service (NEPS) and by the department’s Inspectorate.  In order to ensure the school has the required resources to support the students enrolled, the NCSE has initiated a review of their special need assistant (SNA) resource allocation. During the NCSE assesses the level of need within the school as a whole and this is critical to ensure that the care needs of the entire school are identified and that the school is resourced to meet this identified need. Once the NCSE has completed the review the NCSE will communicate the outcome of the review directly to the school.  When the NCSE completes the SNA review and if additional SNA support is identified as being required it will be provided. In addition, following the outcome of the review, the NCSE can make a local special educational needs organiser (SENO) available to the school to discuss their current deployment of SNA supports in the school and to put these supports to the best advantage of the students. The NCSE in-school support service is also available to schools to offer further guidance and support.

        "answerText": " Minister for Health  The Model of Care for Fertility was developed by the Department of Health in conjunction with the HSE’s National Women & Infants Health Programme to ensure that fertility-related issues are addressed through the public health system at the lowest level of clinical intervention necessary.  Referrals for publicly-funded, privately-provided assisted human reproduction (AHR) treatment commenced in September 2023, subject to patients meeting the criteria agreed by the Department and the HSE. The access criteria were developed by a multi-disciplinary group, with reproductive medicine expertise and followed consultation with experts in the field along with a review of the international evidence. These criteria are in keeping with those applied in other jurisdictions.  More information is available on the HSE website in respect of the publicly-funded AHR treatment initiative at:  www2.hse.ie/pregnancy-birth/trying-for-a-baby/your-fertility/getting-ivf-icsi-iui-hse/  or on public fertility services more generally at:  www2.hse.ie/conditions/fertility-problems-treatments/fertility-treatment/  Up to 21 November 2025, over 3,400 couples have been referred by a Reproductive Specialist Consultant for AHR treatment, following extensive investigations and/or secondary level treatment within the Regional Fertility Hubs. Furthermore, the Hubs have successfully and directly managed thousands more patients presenting with fertility-related issues who have been referred by their GP. Not all couples experiencing fertility challenges actually require such advanced and invasive interventions as IVF.  I was pleased to announce recently that, from 30 June 2025, an important criterion for accessing state-funded AHR treatment has been broadened. Couples with one existing child in their relationship, and who meet all the other current access criteria, can now access publicly-funded AHR treatment, including one full cycle of IVF or ICSI, if they are referred for same by a Reproductive Specialist Consultant within one of the Regional Fertility Hubs. Previously, couples with one child in their current relationship were not eligible to access publicly-funded AHR treatment.  There are complex regulatory and clinical issues to be considered in respect of certain categories of AHR treatment. In the case of treatment involving the use of donated gametes, while there is regulation at European level concerning the quality and safety of procedures involving donated gametes, and the Children and Family Relationships Act 2015 deals with matters relating to parentage and the right to identity of donor-conceived children arising from such procedures, there are a number of further clinical and regulatory requirements regarding the donation and use of donated gametes which are being considered.  The access criteria and the terms of the AHR treatment initiative are being kept under ongoing review. Further potential changes to the access criteria or expansion of the initiative requires continued extensive consultation between Department officials, colleagues in the HSE, and also with relevant specialists in the field of reproductive medicine. This will include consideration of additional funding requirements which may ensue from any proposed expansion of the initiative.  It should be noted that supports previously available to patients who access IVF, or other AHR treatment, privately, whereby tax relief on the costs involved can be claimed under the tax relief for medical expenses scheme, continues to be provided.  In addition, a defined list of fertility medicines needed for fertility treatment is covered under the High Tech Arrangements administered by the HSE. Medicines covered by the High Tech Arrangements must be prescribed by a consultant/specialist and authorised for supply to the client’s nominated community pharmacy by the High Tech Hub managed by the Primary Care Reimbursement Service. The cost of the medicines is then covered, as appropriate, under the client’s eligibility, i.e., Medical Card or Drugs Payment Scheme. The annual cost to the State of the financial support for these medicines is far from insignificant.  I want to reassure you that my Department and the Government are focused, through the full implementation of the Model of Care for Fertility, on ensuring that patients receive care at the appropriate level of clinical intervention and then those requiring, and eligible for, advanced AHR treatment such as IVF will be able to access same through the most effective deployment of finite public resources ",

Deputy Marie Sherlock asked the Minister for Health the steps she is taking to protect the incomes of front-line healthcare workers who continue to suffer from long Covid and who are in receipt of the special scheme of paid leave, which is due to expire in the coming weeks; if she plans to protect these workers by extending this scheme or recognising long Covid as an occupational illness; and if she will make a statement on the matter.

        "answerText": " Deputy Marie Sherlock  My question relates to the special sick pay scheme for Covid sufferers in the health service. As the Minister knows, it is expiring at the end of this year. We spoke about this in June. The Labour Court ruled that it should be extended to the end of the year. What interventions is the Minister making to ensure those 120-plus workers have decent financial support into 2026 in recognition of the fact they acquired this illness in the workplace in the course of their work? \n Deputy Jennifer Carroll MacNeill  I thank the Deputy for raising this with me again. We should always acknowledge the extraordinary role, as the Deputy has done, of our healthcare workers and the role they played during the pandemic. They went far beyond the call of duty. Treating Covid in a front-line way at that time was an exceptional thing to do.  In recognition of that, especially from 2020, a temporary special scheme was introduced in July 2022 to support eligible staff who were affected by long Covid, in particular, in the public health sector. This was a scheme that no other sector had, which was important and appropriate. The scheme was designed to support those who had worked in high-risk environments, particularly before PPE and vaccinations were widely available and community transmission became more prevalent. At present, about 159 employees, as I understand it, remain on the scheme, the majority of whom have been supported with full pay for almost five years.  My Department has consistently worked to ensure these staff were looked after. At my Department's request, the Department of Public Expenditure, Infrastructure, Public Service Reform and Digitalisation agreed to extend the scheme several times since its introduction. Following a Labour Court hearing in June of this year, a final extension was recommended to run until 31 December 2025, when it will formally conclude. Importantly, that does not mean all supports will end. Staff who remain unfit to work will move seamlessly into the public service sick leave scheme, which I appreciate is different but will ensure some measure of continuity of care and financial protection. Under that scheme, staff receive full pay for three months, followed by half pay for three months, and then have the option to apply for temporary rehabilitative remuneration, which can provide up to a further 547 days of paid leave. In addition, the critical illness protocol may provide supports for up to three years.  I am aware that the Minister for Social Protection has reviewed the EU recommendation on recognising Covid-19 as an occupational illness. It has been determined that Covid-19 does not meet the criteria required for recognition under the social welfare Acts. \n Deputy Marie Sherlock  Every long Covid sufferer out there will acknowledge that this scheme has been extended. They are very grateful that it has been kept going until now, but the reality is 159 healthcare workers are out there, including nurses, healthcare support workers, social workers and those working in mental health institutions, who face the prospect of a dramatic drop in income because of a condition they acquired in the workplace. Ireland, alongside Greece, is the only EU member state not to recognise long Covid. What will the Minister do to champion the rights of healthcare workers? As she knows, the temporary rehabilitation remuneration, TRR, scheme will only give workers just over a third of their full pay, at 37.5%. Some of these workers hope to go back into the workforce eventually. Some may never, but they should get the recognition they deserve for the illness they acquired in the workplace. \n Deputy Jennifer Carroll MacNeill  I appreciate what the Deputy is saying. I will make a couple of points in response. The public health sector recognised the risk that staff faced and because of that introduced a scheme that no other sector had.  It was appropriate that it did, but it is important to state that so people have a full understanding of what was done. Eligible healthcare workers have had full pay for five years, which is important. The provisions now provide paid supports for a number of years beyond this current period. Recognition of Covid as an occupational illness falls within the Department of Social Protection. The Deputy has alluded to other EU countries. Many EU countries recognised Covid-19 as an occupational illness, but not necessarily long Covid. I am open to correction, but it is not clear to me that any country sustained full pay for workers suffering from long Covid in the way Ireland did with its public health workers through the special scheme. I am open to correction, but that is the information I have. It is important to set out how Ireland tried to treat its care workers in contrast to Europe and for the duration it has. \n Deputy Marie Sherlock  I do not think anybody is suggesting that full pay is sustainable into 2026 and beyond, but what should be sustainable for a small amount of money is a recognition that it is an occupational illness, with a new scheme put in place. The reality is that the science in 2021 suggested that people would be fully over long Covid at this stage. In June, I said I believed the Department was splitting hairs between Covid-19 and long Covid. The science and medical research are well established now in confirming what long Covid is. I know that are many long Covid sufferers and their families who are watching this debate are asking the Minister, with the rest of Government, to champion this such that it will be recognised as an occupational illness and a new scheme will be put in place in 2026. \n Deputy Jennifer Carroll MacNeill  I recognise the sufferers of long Covid and the change for 159 people who have been receiving full pay and are going onto a different scheme. While there are supports available on that scheme and its duration is also considerable, it is a change and I recognise that. My Department has championed the extension of that scheme, which enabled them to have full pay for as long as they did, on a number of occasions with the Department of public expenditure. As we thought that would end in June, there has been an additional six-month extension. That is in recognition of the work they did, the significance of long Covid and the impact it has on their lives. As the Deputy has stated, it is not feasible to sustain that in perpetuity and there has to be a transition to a different scheme. That is simply the way it is, and we are trying to put those supports in place for as long as possible. ",

This demand led scheme is available to women who are waiting on an Irish waiting list for endometriosis surgery.  The scheme will cover the cost of approved appointments, surgery and some travel costs. A HSE list of approved healthcare centres has been made available on the HSE website.  The primary concern for the selection of endometriosis centres abroad is patient safety and clinical efficacy. The HSE list of approved healthcare centres abroad have been selected based on recognised accreditation. All centres on the list have been accredited by either the British Society for Gynaecological Endoscopy or the European Endometriosis League.  The current list of approved clinics is being kept under continual review. The HSE is establishing an endometriosis clinical advisory group. This group will include international expertise and will assess other possible clinics for inclusion. This assessment and review process will also cover clinics in Romania and Greece. ",

        "answerText": " Minister for Health  As Minister for Health, I am the competent authority for psychologists. This includes recognition of clinical, counselling and educational psychology qualifications. Recognition is required for employment in the publicly funded sector in Ireland.  Officials in the Validation Unit in my Department administer the process. Qualifications are assessed under the EU Professional Qualifications Directive.  The Department is advised in the process by the Psychological Society of Ireland. An Expert Validation Committee assesses applications and makes recommendations to the Department. On receiving the recommendation, the Validation Unit issues a decision letter to applicants.  Under the Directive, decisions on applications should be made within 4 months. Decisions on applications outside the Directive’s scope are issued within 6 months. The Validation Unit works hard to deliver decisions within the required timelines.  Qualifications are assessed against those required for employment in the HSE. Assessments of professional qualifications and experience are on a case-by-case basis. This process takes time given the expert input required.  Some applicants will have deficits in their qualifications compared to the Irish qualification. They will then have to complete a compensation measure. This is required so that their qualification aligns with the Irish qualification.  Recognition helps ensure all HSE psychologists are trained to the same high standard. The recognition process helps to protect service users. ",

        "answerText": " Minister for Health  The provision of proper, appropriate and integrated gender healthcare services is something that I want to ensure is in place for those who are questioning their gender identity or are experiencing gender incongruence or dysphoria.  As outlined in the Programme for Government 2025, the Government are committed to ensuring a transgender healthcare service that is based on clinical evidence, respect, inclusiveness and compassion.  A new clinical programme for gender healthcare has been initiated by the HSE and an updated clinical model for gender healthcare services is being developed. This work will inform an implementation plan for its delivery.  A Clinical Advisory Group has been established and was convened in June 2025 with the Royal College of Physicians of Ireland.  As part of the development of the model of care, the existing and emerging evidence base, including international evidence on health outcomes, and data on the clinical needs of those presenting to clinical services over the years, will be reviewed. The Model of Care will consider all available information, and will not be aligned with any one study, report, or set of guidelines.  The HSE commenced the systematic review on the evidence base with respect to co-existing clinical needs in gender diverse people with support from the HSE Library Service. Interim results of this review were made available for public consultation during the month of August 2025. The HSE are now reviewing any submissions and completing the evidence review of this topic.  Another main element of the work will include a review of the experience base which encompasses an understanding of the experience of service users, their families, healthcare workers in gender healthcare and other stakeholders. As this is an area of healthcare where there are many public voices, all efforts will be made to hear from those with who have lived and living experience. In this regard, a number of lived experience engagement design sessions, attended by a number of advocacy groups, have been held to inform the development of a plan to maximise stakeholder engagement.  Developing a model of care for Gender Healthcare Services is expected to be a complex process and the HSE and department officials will work closely together to support the process, ensure transparency and keep the patient at the centre of the process.  It is important that the HSE is given time to develop a model of care that is based on the best clinical evidence and that will deliver the best outcomes for persons with gender incongruence or dysphoria.

        "answerText": " Minister for Health  As Minister for Health, I am determined to support our screening programmes, which are a valuable part of our health service, enabling early treatment and care for many people, and improving the overall health of our population.  Currently, all babies (between 3 and 5 days old) are offered newborn bloodspot screening (generally known as the ‘heel prick’ test), which tests for nine rare but serious conditions that are treatable if detected early in life. The Programme for Government commits to continually reviewing the number of conditions babies are screened for.  Incremental progress continues to be made on the expansion of the National Newborn Bloodspot Screening Programme (NNBSP). In 2023, two recommendations from the National Screening Advisory Committee (NSAC) on the addition of Severe Combined Immunodeficiency (SCID) and Spinal Muscular Atrophy (SMA) to the NNBSP were approved.  In Budget 2024, an additional €1.4 million of new development funding was provided to support the SMA/SCID implementation process. Once both conditions have been fully implemented, the number of conditions screened for in Ireland will increase to 11.  In terms of the current implementation status, the HSE has advised that the equipment needed to enable the roll-out testing for SMA and SCID has been purchased, delivered and successfully installed at the newborn screening laboratory and significant progress continues with regards to the laboratory verification process. The recruitment process to hire the additional staff required to support the expansion of the NNBSP has been completed and work continues on developing screening pathways for both conditions.  In relation to concerns raised around the length of the implementation process, it should be emphasised that Ireland is not taking longer than other comparable countries to assess and implement additions to the NNBSP.  The Health Council of the Netherlands first recommended screening for SMA in 2019 and implementation was completed three years later in October 2022. In the United States of America, it took six years to fully implement SMA screening after it was added to the Recommended Uniform Screening Panel (RUSP) in 2018. In the United Kingdom, screening for SCID and SMA have been under consideration by the UK National Screening Committee since 2017 and 2018 respectively.  Nevertheless, I am acutely aware of how difficult it is for parents, families and children who have received a diagnosis of a rare disease, and how challenging daily life can be for them. This is why I remain committed to the further expansion of screening in Ireland in accordance with internationally accepted criteria and best practice. ",

        "answerText": " Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage  I propose to take Questions Nos. 562, 587, 598 and 600 together.  My Department publishes comprehensive programme-level statistics on a quarterly basis on social and affordable housing delivery activity by local authorities and Approved Housing Bodies (AHBs) in each local authority, on a local authority basis. Data on social housing delivery against targets is also published. This data is available to the end of Q2 2025 and is published on the statistics page of my Department’s website at the following link: [ www.gov.ie/en/collection/6060e-overall-social-housing-provision/ ].  My Department also publishes the Social Housing Construction Status Report (CSR), which provides details of social housing developments, their location and their funding programme, such as turnkey or construction, that have been completed, are under construction or are progressing through the various stages of the design and tender processes. The most recent publication was for Quarter 2 2025 and it includes details on social housing units completed since 2022. Data on social homes completed prior to 2022 can be found in previous CSRs. All CSRs are available at the following link:  [ www.gov.ie/en/collection/cb885-social-housing-construction-projects-status-reports/ ].  A version of the CSR file can also be downloaded for analysis by local authority, location etc. at this link: [ https://data.gov.ie/dataset/social-housing-construction-status-report-q2-2025 ].  The Housing Needs and Demand Assessment provides evidence-based insights into housing needs across all tenures analysing demographic trends, affordability data and housing stock pressures. This framework allows local authorities to make informed decisions about future housing requirements. Following a comprehensive Housing Needs and Demand Assessment, all local authorities developed and published their Housing Delivery Action Plans setting out their plans to deliver social and affordable housing during the period from 2022-2026.  Details on the number of households qualified for social housing support in each local authority administrative area is provided in the annual statutory Summary of Social Housing Assessments (SSHA). The most recently published summary for all counties, conducted in November 2024, is available on my Department's website at: www.gov.ie/en/collection/62486-summary-of-social-housing-assessments.  My Department does not collate data on the level of occupation of local authority dwellings. Such information may be obtained from individual local authorities.  Statistics in relation to local authority social housing stock are published by the National Oversight and Audit Commission (NOAC) in the annual Local Authority Performance Indicator Report. These reports provide a range of information in relation to social housing stock, including the number of social housing units in local authority ownership at a given time. The most recent report, relating to 2024, is available on the NOAC website at the following link: [ www.noac.ie/noac_publications/report-77-noac-performance-indicator-report-2024/ ].  The Government’s new housing plan, Delivering Homes, Building Communities aims to deliver 300,000 new homes by the end of 2030 including delivering an average of 12,000 new build social homes per annum in the period 2025 - 2030.  The updated National Development Plan has committed record levels of funding for new social and affordable housing, totalling almost €20 billion. In Budget 2026, the total Exchequer funding being made available for the delivery of housing programmes is €7.21bn, comprising €5.19bn in Capital Funding and €2.021bn in Current Funding. The Exchequer Capital provision of €5.19bn will be supplemented by Land Development Agency (LDA) investment (projected up to €1.6bn) and Housing Finance Agency (HFA) lending (projected over €2bn), resulting in an overall capital provision of over €9bn.  Local authorities are best placed to identify suitable sites for social and affordable housing delivery and bring forward proposals to my Department in line with local need. Government is fully committed to working with all stakeholders to deliver social, affordable and cost rental homes at scale and to continue accelerating housing supply across all tenures. ",
