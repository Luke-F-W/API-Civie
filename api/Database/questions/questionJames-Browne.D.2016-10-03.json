        "answerText": " Minister of State at the Department of Public Expenditure, National Development Plan Delivery and Reform  There have been 4 applications for funding under The Office of Public Works (OPW), Minor Flood Mitigation Works and Coastal Protection Scheme submitted by Wexford County Council (WCC), for the location concerned.  In April 2021, funding of €36,000 was approved to enable WCC undertake a detailed design study for this location, with further funding of €367,740 approved in November 2021 for emergency works which entailed rock armour cliff toe protection to approximately 70 to 85m of cliff frontage immediately adjacent to the access road to 14 properties that were at immediate risk of erosion.  In June 2024, funding of €668,921 was approved whereby WCC proposed to implement 155m of rock armour coastal protection fronting several houses at the location concerned.  An application for funding under this scheme which proposes to protect a further 145m of coastline is currently under review by the OPW and WCC will be notified of the outcome of this review shortly. Progression of the works is a matter for WCC.  The Minor Flood Mitigation Works and Coastal Protection Scheme was introduced by the Office of Public Works (OPW) on an administrative, non-statutory basis in 2009. The purpose of this scheme is to provide funding to Local Authorities to undertake minor flood mitigation works or studies to address localised flooding and coastal protection problems within their administrative areas.  Applications for funding from local authorities are considered for flood relief and erosion protection measures costing up to €750,000 in each instance. Funding of up to 90% of the cost is available for approved projects. Applications are assessed by the OPW having regard to the specific economic, social and environmental criteria of the scheme, including a cost benefit ratio and having regard to the availability of funding for flood risk management. Full details of this scheme are available on www.floodinfo.ie/ . ",

        "answerText": " Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment  The latest employment survey results from Enterprise Ireland present a positive outlook for the Irish economy, particularly in the sectors under its remit.  According to the Annual Employment Survey 2023, there has been a notable increase in employment levels across industrial and service companies. This growth is not just confined to the capital city but is spread across the country, with 68% of the new jobs being created outside of Dublin.  Furthermore, the survey provides a decade-long perspective on employment trends, offering valuable insights into the evolution of Ireland's industrial and services landscape. Over the seven-year period from 2017 to 2023, there has been a consistent upward trajectory in employment figures for companies supported by Enterprise Ireland in County Wexford, reflecting the success of policies aimed at fostering enterprise and innovation. The strategic focus on diversifying Ireland's economic base and promoting exports has also contributed to this positive trend.  In conclusion, the Annual Employment Surveys indicates that Wexford's economy is on a solid growth path, with Enterprise Ireland playing a pivotal role in supporting businesses and job creation.

        "answerText": " Minister for Finance  The policy responsibility for the matter of politically exposed persons, or PEPs, rests primarily with the Minister for Justice, but clearly, rules in relation to customer due diligence in respect of any individual, often arise to be applied by financial institutions.  The Criminal Justice (Money Laundering and Terrorist Financing) Act 2010 is the relevant piece of Irish legislation which outlines the conditions for a designated person or body to take measures in assessing whether or not a customer, or a beneficial owner connected with the customer, is a politically exposed person or an immediate family member or close associate of a politically exposed person.  In January 2023, the Minister for Justice, with the consent of the Minister for Finance, approved the issuance of guidelines, under Section 37(12) of the Criminal Justice (Money Laundering and Terrorist Financing) Act 2010, in respect of functions in the State that may be considered to be prominent public functions. These guidelines were issued to competent authorities and published on the Department’s website.  The Central Bank of Ireland (the “Central Bank”) is the competent authority in Ireland for monitoring and supervising financial and credit institutions’ (“firms”) compliance with their anti-money laundering and countering the financing of terrorism (“AML/CFT”) obligations under the Criminal Justice (Money Laundering and Terrorist Financing) Act 2010 (as amended) (the “CJA 2010”). Sections 37 to 39 of the CJA 2010 provide a definition of persons who are classified as Politically Exposed Persons (“PEPs”) and prescribes circumstances in which firms are required to apply enhanced customer due diligence (“EDD”) measures. Section 37(4)(c) of the CJA 2010 requires firms to apply enhanced monitoring of the business relationship with PEPs. Section 37(4A) of the CJA 2010 requires firms to continue to apply the measures set out in Section 37(4), to a PEP, for as long as is reasonably required until the person is no longer deemed to pose a risk, arising from his or her previous PEP status.  The Central Bank’s Anti-Money Laundering and Countering the Financing of Terrorism Guidelines for the Financial Sector (the “AML Guidelines”), available on the Central Bank’s website, seek to assist firms in understanding their AML/CFT obligations under Part 4 of the CJA 2010. Section 5.5 covers enhanced due diligence (EDD) and provides that firms should apply risk proportionate levels of EDD measures in those situations where it is commensurate to the money laundering/terrorist financing (“ML/TF”) risk they have identified. In circumstances in which a firm has determined that customers or business scenarios present a higher ML/TF risk, EDD measures should be applied. Firms should also ensure that they clearly document their rationale for applying EDD measures. Section 5.6 covers EDD in relation to PEPs and Section 5.6.4 covers Enhanced on-going Monitoring of PEPs. The AML Guidelines emphasise that “ PEP status itself is intended to apply higher vigilance to certain individuals and put those individuals that are customers or beneficial owners into a higher risk category. It is not intended to suggest that such individuals are involved in suspicious activity .”  The Central Bank does not:  expressly provide the actions/steps that firms should take in the identification of PEPs;  prescribe the length of time that such measures should be applied; or  provide legal or interpretive advice to firms in respect of their obligations under legislation.

        "answerText": " Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage (Deputy Darragh O'Brien)  In January 2023, I announced details regarding a third round of funding under the Urban Regeneration and Development Fund (URDF). Supporting key objectives of Housing for All, Town Centre First, and the Vacant Homes Action Plan, this round of URDF support has been specifically designed to address long term vacancy and dereliction across URDF eligible cities and towns.  This will be achieved through the provision of a €150 million fund for local authorities to acquire vacant or derelict properties (residential and/or commercial) and to carry out any associated works needed to de-risk or improve the property to make it more attractive for re-use or sale. The fund would then be replenished from the proceeds received from the end use/user thereby, allowing the local authority to put in place a rolling programme of acquisitions in order to tackle long term vacancy and dereliction without recourse to borrowing and the associated financial risk.  In July 2023, following consultation with the Local Authority sector, including Wexford County Council, I announced details of each Local Authority's Approved Acquisition Programme, funding allocations and arrangements for the third round of funding under the URDF.  As part of this announcement, Wexford County Council was awarded €6.5 million in URDF funding to help tackle vacancy and dereliction in their URDF eligible areas, which are Wexford Town, New Ross and Enniscorthy. As a one-off measure to encourage early activity under the programme and a demonstration of Government commitment to tackling the long term vacancy and dereliction issue in our towns and cities, Wexford County Council also received €1,300,000 of their funding allocation by way of forward funding.  Wexford County Council initially identified 216 properties as suitable for acquisition under the programme, with a total estimated acquisition cost of €26,374,167.  The initial focus of the approved Acquisition Programmes is on tackling vacant or derelict buildings located within town centre areas that will provide, as part of their ultimate end use, some element of residential use.  On this basis, 169 of the properties submitted by Wexford County Council across all their URDF eligible towns have been prioritisied for acquisition and placed on the approved acquisition programme. It is not the case that properties identified have been refused but rather they are not prioritisied for acquisition at this time.  As set out in Circular URDF 03/2023, I am happy to consider any submission from Wexford County Council making a strong case for the inclusion of any of the properties not currently included on their acquisition programme. Recent correspondence from Wexford County Council indicates that the council have no additional properties they wish to include in their approved programme at this time. Wexford County Council are now being encouraged to proceed with tackling the 169 properties included on their acquisition programme. ",

        "answerText": " Minister for Health  I propose to take Questions Nos. 114, 171 and 372 together.  Kaftrio has been a life changing drug for Cystic Fibrosis sufferers, and I want to see it made available to everyone who needs it. This Government wants to ensure greater access to new and innovative medicines and has allocated significant additional funding for new medicines in recent Budgets. Since the beginning of 2021, 112 new medicines, or expanded uses of existing medicines, have been funded. This has included 35 for the treatment of rare diseases, including Cystic Fibrosis.  The HSE has statutory responsibility for decisions on pricing and reimbursement of medicines under the community drugs schemes, in accordance with the Health (Pricing and Supply of Medical Goods) Act 2013.  I am grateful to Cystic Fibrosis Ireland (CFI) for meeting with me recently, and outlining the concerns of the Cystic Fibrosis community. We discussed the recent statement from the Consultants providing care for these children, with all parties aligning in the view that the approach taken by the manufacturer, Vertex, is unfair to these children. I reassured CFI of the urgency with which the Government and the HSE are approaching the current situation.  As Vertex are seeking additional funds to cover this group, a Health Technology Assessment (HTA) had to be completed by the National Centre for Pharmacoeconomics (NCPE). The NCPE has now completed a full assessment and their report has been received by the HSE. The HSE's Corporate Pharmaceutical Unit (CPU) is the interface between the HSE and the Pharmaceutical Industry in relation to medicine pricing and reimbursement applications. CPU have scheduled a meeting with Vertex to discuss their application and recommendation(s) received from the NCPE for Kaftrio.  I am glad to see progress on this issue, and hope that it can be quickly brought to a satisfactory conclusion for everyone. ",

I brought a proposal on student accommodation to the Cabinet Committee on Housing in October and received support to progress a new policy that bridges the challenging gap between the viability of delivering purpose-built student accommodation and subsequent rental affordability for students.  Supported by the agreement from the Cabinet Committee on Housing, I intend to bring a memorandum to Government in November with proposals to support the construction of student accommodation on identified public sites in return for affordable rates for priority groups, together with an outline of planned wider policy development.  This will involve the State for the first time assisting with the cost of building student accommodation in return for affordability commitments on rent.  To advance this work I have established a dedicated Student Accommodation Unit which the purpose of examining and drafting a policy for Student Housing and Accommodation as a matter of urgency. This unit will lead the examination of and development of a range of policy options and supports to ensure that adequate accommodation will be provided to students especially those who are struggling to afford rent.  Housing For All contains an action to stimulating supply of affordable student accommodation in addition it also contains a commitment to support technological universities (TUs) to develop purpose-built student accommodation where such a requirement exists.

In total 15 community, voluntary and not-for-profit organisations were funded to deliver 10 hours of free informal basic digital skills classes to people who did not have the confidence or skills to use the internet and access online services. Since the training scheme commenced in 2017, €5.5 million has been invested in providing training to over 60,000 participants. Training modules included internet safety, how to send and receive emails, how to tax your car online and how to use social media. This training scheme was targeted at people over 45 years of age, farming communities, small business owners, the unemployed, persons with disabilities and disadvantaged groups.  As per the terms of their Grant Agreement the organisation in question received €398,027 in grant funding and have recently completed their training obligations under the Scheme. ",

        "answerText": " Minister for Finance  I am advised by Revenue that for Capital Acquisitions Tax (CAT) purposes the relationship between the person giving a gift or inheritance (i.e. the disponer) and the person receiving it (i.e. the beneficiary) determines the maximum amount, known as the “Group threshold”, below which CAT does not arise.  The Group A threshold (currently €335,000) applies, inter alia, where the beneficiary is a child (including adopted child, stepchild and certain foster children) of the disponer. The Group B threshold (currently €32,500) applies where the beneficiary is a brother, sister, nephew, niece or lineal ancestor or lineal descendant such as a grandchild of the disponer. The Group C threshold (currently €16,250) applies in all other cases. The respective thresholds apply to all gifts and inheritances received within the same Group - they are never doubled. Therefore, a child will not be entitled to a Group threshold of €670,000 in any circumstance.  Any prior gift or inheritance received by a beneficiary since 5 December 1991 from within the same Group threshold is aggregated for the purposes of determining whether any tax is payable on a benefit. Where a person receives gifts or inheritances that are in excess of his or her relevant tax-free threshold, CAT at a rate of 33% applies on the excess.  Accordingly, where a person receives a gift or inheritance from a parent, the Group A threshold of €335,000 applies. In the circumstances described by the Deputy, the receipt by each child of benefits from his or her surviving parent will be aggregated with any benefits received from the parent who has died for the purposes of determining whether the threshold of €335,000 has been exceeded.  In addition to the above, a person may receive gifts up to a total value of €3,000 from any person in any calendar year without having to pay CAT (the “small gifts exemption”). Gifts within this limit are not taken into account in computing tax and are not included for aggregation purposes. For the purposes of determining whether the small gifts exemption is due, the relationship between disponer and beneficiary are not relevant, and the exemption is not transferable. In the circumstances described by the Deputy, each child would be entitled to receive gifts up to the value of €3,000 from the surviving parent in any calendar year. Prior to the death of their other parent, each child would have been entitled to receive gifts up to the total value of €3,000 from each parent free of tax, potentially having a combined total value of €6,000 each year.

The centre will collect best practices, research, support, and/or offer training in the field of sustainable energy in housing, sustainable smart cities, and urban development.  My Department has lead responsibility for the implementation of Nearly Zero Energy Buildings (NZEB). NZEB requirements make it more attractive for builders and homeowners to further incorporate renewable technologies and move away from traditional fossil fuels. The Central Statistics Office analysis of Building Energy Rating data demonstrates this shift away from fossil fuels; oil boilers are no longer installed in new dwellings, and heat pumps make up 80% of heating systems in new dwellings with this percentage growing steadily each year.  Housing for All sets a target of an average of 33,000 Nearly Zero Energy dwellings per annum.  To date WWETB have trained over 1,500 workers in NZEB skills in the UNECE Centre of Excellence.
