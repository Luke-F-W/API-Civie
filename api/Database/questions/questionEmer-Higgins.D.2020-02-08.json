        "answerText": " Minister for Education  I can assure the Deputy that the provision of school places to meet the needs of children and young people at primary and post primary level, including children and young people with special educational needs is an absolute priority for the Department.  As the Deputy will be aware, for school planning purposes, my Department divides the country into 314 school planning areas and utilises a Geographical Information System to anticipate school place demand. Information from a range of sources, including Child Benefit data, school enrolment data and information on residential development activity is used for this purpose. Additionally, Project Ireland 2040 population and housing targets inform my Department's projections of school place requirements.  My Department has delivered significant expanded capacity in the Dublin Mid-West area, including the new schools for Adamstown Community College and Kishogue Community College. These two new schools alone have delivered 2,000 additional school places in recent years.  There are also a large number of building projects on site or in train across Dublin Mid-West including new school buildings for the recently established Coláiste Pobail Fola and Griffeen Community College. New school buildings or extensions are also in train for Holy Family Community School, Tallaght Community School, St. Joseph's College and Lucan Community College. The projects, when completed, will collectively deliver an additional 6,000 new and modernised school places.  Multiple smaller projects providing additional accommodation are also at various stages of planning and delivery.  Notwithstanding this scale of ongoing project delivery, the Department is aware of pressures for school places in some School Planning Areas.  In that context, as part of planning for September 2024, data on applications for admission has been received by the department from post-primary schools across areas of known enrolment pressure including the School Planning Areas of Lucan and Newcastle_Rathcoole. The sharing of this data has been helpful in the identification of school place requirements across the areas.  However, in urban areas, there can be a high degree of inward and outward mobility of children between School Planning Areas. Parents and guardians are free to apply to enrol their children in any school, whether that is in the School Planning Area in which they reside or not. This mobility adds significant complexity to the identification of actual school place needs in these areas. In particular, there can be multiple iterations of school place offers, where applicants may accept a place but subsequently be offered and accept a place at a second school, freeing up capacity at the first school accepted.  In that context, while some applicants may not yet have received an offer of a school place for 2024/25, families can be assured that all children who require a school place will be provided with one. The Department is continuing to work with schools and patrons to ensure that there are sufficient school places available, and to put any required solutions in place. As part of this engagement with patrons, the Department is also collaboratively planning towards 2025/26 and future years, as part of forward planning generally.  I can assure the Deputy that Department officials will continue to actively engage with schools and patrons to ensure that there is appropriate provision for all students in Dublin Mid-West school planning areas for the 2024/25 school year and into the future.

        "showAs": " 677. Deputy Emer Higgins asked the Minister for Education the number of free schoolbooks distributed to schools in Dublin mid-west over the past year and for the semester ahead; and if she will make a statement on the matter. [31948/24] ",
        "answerText": " Minister for Education  As part of Budget 2023, I announced a major investment of over €50 million to provide free schoolbooks in recognised primary schools and special schools. This was a landmark moment in Irish education and one that furthers our goal to provide free education for all and ensure that every child can benefit from free education.  In 2024 over €47 million was allocated to continue implementation of the schoolbooks scheme at primary level. On the 8th May I announced details of year 2 of the Primary Schoolbooks Scheme which provides at a minimum free schoolbooks, workbooks and copybooks to pupils in recognised primary and special schools. More than 555,000 pupils enrolled in approximately 3,230 primary schools, including over 130 special schools will continue to benefit from this scheme.  Revised guidance for the 2024/25 school year was published on my Department’s website at www.gov.ie/schoolbookschemes and has issued to schools.  In 2023 schools received €96 per pupil and based on pupil enrolment figures from September 2022. The grant for 2024/25 is allocated on a per capita basis at a rate of €80 per pupil enrolled as of September 2023. Special schools that have students enrolled in Junior Cycle programmes have received funding at the Junior Cycle per capita rate of €309 per student set out under the new Junior Cycle Schoolbooks Scheme in respect of these students to provide books and core classroom resources under the new Junior Cycle Schoolbooks Scheme which commences from September 2024.  At a minimum the primary scheme funding is to provide schoolbooks, workbooks and copybooks for all children and young people enrolled in recognised primary schools and special schools. The scope of the scheme means funding is provided directly to schools so that primary and special schools will continue to have autonomy to choose schoolbooks and related classroom resources that meet their individual needs in line with curricular requirements. In the case of special classes in primary schools, they have autonomy to choose resources that meet the learning needs of the pupils.  Schools are expected to adopt a cost-conscious approach to the selection of books for use in their classes. Apart from a small number of prescribed texts at post-primary level, determined by the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment (NCCA), the decisions on which textbooks, programmes and resources, if any, to use in primary and post-primary schools are taken at school level.  Therefore, the number or edition of schoolbook and/or workbook required by each pupil for individual subjects will be determined at a local level by each school and so this data is not held by Department.  As part of the on-going evaluation of the scheme, all schools will be asked to provide data on their expenditure for the 2024/25 school year in order to inform the guidance, implementation, costs and efficiency of the scheme for future years.

        "showAs": " 88. Deputy Emer Higgins asked the Minister for Education for an update on forward planning for additional schools in Lucan to meet extra demand driven by growth and projected growths in population through the development of Lucan and the Clonburris and Adamstown strategic zones; and if she will make a statement on the matter. [28381/24] ",
        "answerText": " Minister for Education  I wish to advise the Deputy that requirements for school places is kept under on-going review in the context of available information on population, enrolments and residential development activity.  In order to plan for school provision and analyse the relevant demographic data, my Department divides the country into 314 school planning areas and uses a Geographical Information System, using data from a range of sources, including CSO Census data, Child Benefit and school enrolment data, to identify where the pressure for school places across the country will arise and where additional school accommodation is needed at primary and post-primary level.  Major new residential developments have the potential to alter the demand for school places at a local level. In that regard, as part of the demographic demand analysis, my Department monitors planning and construction activity in the residential sector. This involves the analysis of data sources from Local Authorities and the CSO along with the engagement with local authorities and the construction sector. In this way, up-to-date information on significant new residential developments is obtained and factored into the demographic analysis exercise. This is necessary to ensure that schools infrastructure planning is keeping pace with demographic changes, at a local level, where there is a constantly evolving picture with planned new residential development.  The 2023 demographic exercise indicates that 79% of the 314 school planning areas at primary level show static or decreasing enrolments for the period to 2027 compared with 2022.  At post-primary level some 78% of school planning areas are anticipated to have increased enrolments for the period to 2030, with most expected to reach a peak within the next two or three years.  Lucan and Adamstown are located in the Lucan school planning area. The Lucan SPA projected peak year at primary level was 2018 and at post primary is 2024 with enrolments decreasing thereafter.  Clonburris is located in the Clondalkin_D22 school planning area. The projected peak year at primary level for Clondalkin_D22 was 2018 and at post primary is 2024, with enrolments decreasing thereafter.  Where demographic data indicates that additional provision is required, the delivery of such additional provision is dependent on the particular circumstances of each case and may, be provided through:  • Utilising existing unused capacity within a school or schools,  • Extending the capacity of a school or schools,  • Provision of a new school or schools.  If additional accommodation is required, the aim to try and facilitate this, as much as possible, by way of expansion of existing schools rather than establishing new schools.  The expansion of existing schools is consistent with wider Government objectives under Project Ireland 2040 for an increased emphasis on compact growth.  In respect of post primary schools, new post primary schools must have a student enrolment capacity of 600-1,000 students and must be co-educational. A lower threshold of 400 students may apply to Gaelcholáistí, having regard to the alternative of establishing an Irish-medium unit (Aonad) in an English-medium school.  My Department is progressing a number of building projects under the National Development Plan in the Lucan and Clondalkin_D22 school planning area’s. The ongoing projects includes a new school build for Griffeen Community College to provide for 1000 pupils plus provision for Special Education Needs, this project is currently at Stage 3- is the instruction for the project to proceed to Tender  In addition, there are building projects for extensions of Lucan Community College and St. Joseph’s College to cater for 1000 pupils, the project for Lucan Community College is at Stage 3 (is the instruction for the project to proceed to Tender) and the project for St. Joseph’s College is currently at Stage 4 -the signing of the letter of acceptance to the successful contractor and commencement on site.  In addition to the mentioned projects, the following projects are also progress in the Lucan school planning area:  Gaelscoil Naomh Padraig (Roll No 19940G)  2 x Special Education Classroom , 1x Mainstream Classroom with en suite toilets:1x UAWC. Project at Stage 1-this is the Preliminary Design Stage where the Design Team in conjunction with the school authorities, will analyse all the constraints of the site, develop a preferred design option and ensure that the preferred option is the best option for the delivery of the brief.  Esker ETNS (20274C) 1x Mainstream classroom:2x Special education Classroom:2x Special education tuition room. Project at Stage 2b – this is the Developed Design & lodgement of Planning Permission.  St Marys BNS (00714P) 5x Mainstream classrooms :3x Special education tuition rooms :2x Special education classrooms:1x UA Toilet and reconfiguration works for Special education classroom in the interim. Project at Stage 1 -this is the Preliminary Design Stage where the Design Team in conjunction with the school authorities, will analyse all the constraints of the site, develop a preferred design option and ensure that the preferred option is the best option for the delivery of the brief.  St Thomas Junior National School (19542R). Refurb of existing classroom into a staff room.  Gaelscoil Naomh Padraig (19940G). Reconfiguration for 1 x Special Education Classroom. Project is at Stage 1 -this is the Preliminary Design Stage where the Design Team in conjunction with the school authorities, will analyse all the constraints of the site, develop a preferred design option and ensure that the preferred option is the best option for the delivery of the brief.  There are four projects planned in the Clondalkin_D22 school planning area:  Scoil Naomh Seosamh (18655C) 1x Special education classroom and reconfiguration works for interim Special education classroom. Approved to go to tender.  Scoil Naomh Aine (19221U) Renovation to existing Special education classroom and construction of 1x additional Special education Class: interim accommodation of 1x Special education classroom prefab.  Talbot SNS (19510E) Reconfiguration of existing 60m room for ASD class.  Coláiste Bríde (60122D) 2 x Special Education Classrooms and ancillary suite. Brief stage- this includes determining the project brief and schedule of accommodation.  The Capital Programme details the school projects that are being progressed under Project Ireland 2040. The current status of large-scale projects being delivered under Project Ireland 2040, may be viewed on the Department’s website at, www.gov.ie  and this information is updated regularly. In addition, a list of large-scale projects completed from 2010 to date may also be viewed on the website.  The pace of delivery of additional residential development in the school planning areas, along with updated enrolment data and demographic data will be kept under review and this will inform the timing of school requirements. My Department will continue to liaise with the Local Authorities in respect to the projected completion of planned residential developments. ",

        "answerText": " Minister for Social Protection  The objective of the School Meals Programme is to provide regular, nutritious food to children to support them in taking full advantage of the education provided to them.  The programme is an important component of policies to encourage school attendance and extra educational achievement.  Following the expansion of the programme in recent years, some 2,600 schools and organisations, covering 443,000 children are now eligible for funding.  The Hot School Meal option of the programme was introduced in 2019 and is currently solely available to primary schools.  Since my appointment as Minister for Social Protection, I have increased the number of schools with access to the Hot School Meal option from an initial pilot of 30 schools to a position where over 2,000 primary schools now eligible to receive a hot meal.  A total of 316,046 children are eligible for hot school meals with 265,751 children now benefitting from the scheme to date.  Details of all schools in Dublin, currently availing of hot school meals for the 2023/2024 school year, can be found in the tabular statement below.

        "answerText": " Minister for Finance  The Deputy should note that whilst I have oversight of the Disabled Drivers and Disabled Passengers Scheme,  I do not have responsibility for disability policy and therefore cannot give a view on Articles 4 and 20 of the UNCRPD.  You should be aware however that both my Department and I share concerns that the Disabled Drivers and Disabled Passengers Scheme (DDS) is no longer fit-for-purpose.  Consequently,  consideration is being given to replacing the DDS. However this will be a matter for Government to decide upon.  The final report of the National Disability & Inclusion Strategy Transport Working Group's review of mobility and transport supports including the DDS, endorsed proposals for a modern, fit-for-purpose vehicle adaptation scheme in line with international best practice that would replace the DDS.  The Working Group was chaired by Minister Anne Rabbitte and led by the Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth (DCEDIY).  Access to transport for people with disabilities is a multifaceted issue that involves work carried out by multiple Government departments and agencies. Under the aegis of the Department of Taoiseach officials from relevant Departments and agencies are meeting to discuss the issues arising from the NDIS report and to map a way forward.  Department of Finance officials are proactively engaging with this Senior Officials Group's work as an important step in considering ways to replace the DDS, as one specific personal transport response, in the context of broader Government consideration of holistic, multifaceted and integrated transport and mobility supports for those with a disability. Four meetings of the group have been held, in July, November, December 2023; and March 2024.  The Department of Finance submitted a note to the group with my approval in mid-January 2024. This note outlines a proposal for a replacement scheme for the DDS which would be a needs-based, grant-led approach for necessary vehicle adaptations that could serve to improve the functional mobility of the individual. This proposal is in line with what the National Disability Inclusion Strategy Transport Working Group Report endorsed. Further consideration is being given to the principles and parameters for a new scheme in line with best international practice.  In that context, any further changes to the existing DDS would run counter to NDIS proposals to entirely replace the scheme with a modern, fit-for-purpose vehicular adaptation scheme.  It also important to note that I have no role in relation to the granting or refusal of PMCs and the HSE and the Medical Board of Appeal must be independent in their clinical determinations. ",

        "answerText": " Minister for Finance  The Deputy will be aware that the final report of the National Disability Inclusion Strategy  (NDIS) Transport Working Group's review of mobility and transport supports including the Disabled Drivers and Disabled Passenger’s Scheme (DDS), endorsed proposals for a modern, fit-for-purpose vehicle adaptation scheme in line with international best practice that would replace the DDS.  The Working Group was chaired by Minister Anne Rabbitte and led by the Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth (DCEDIY).  Access to transport for people with disabilities is a multifaceted issue that involves work carried out by multiple Government departments and agencies. Consequently under the aegis of the Department of Taoiseach officials from relevant Departments and agencies are meeting to discuss the issues arising from the NDIS report and to map a way forward.  My officials are proactively engaging with this Senior Officials Group's  (SOG) work as an important step in considering ways to replace the DDS, as one specific personal transport response, in the context of broader Government consideration of holistic, multifaceted and integrated transport and mobility supports for those with a disability.  Four meetings of the group have been held, in July, November and December 2023 and March 2024.  The Department of Finance has recently submitted a note to the group with my approval in mid-January 2024. This note outlines a proposal for a replacement scheme for the DDS which would be a needs-based, grant-led approach for necessary vehicle adaptations that could serve to improve the functional mobility of the individual. This proposal is in line with what the NDIS Transport Working Group Report endorsed.  This paper is currently being considered by the SOG.  In that context, the Deputy should note that any further changes to the existing DDS would run counter to NDIS proposals to entirely replace the scheme with a modern, fit-for-purpose vehicular adaptation scheme.  Finally the Deputy should be aware  that while my Department has oversight of the DDS, it does not have responsibility for disability policy, so any decision to put in place a new scheme to replace it will be a matter for Government.

The project is at Architectural Planning Stage 3 – Tender Action and Award. The tender report is under review by my department, the next step in the process is the authorisation to issue the Letter of Intent. Once the Letter of Intent issues, there is a minimum 14-day standstill period before there can be further progression of the project. The period between Letter of Intent and Letter of Acceptance varies depending on the project and the extent of post-tender clarifications required.  I want to reassure the Deputy and the school community, that the school building project will be progressed and delivered.  All departments, including the Department of Education, have to control the timing and scope of capital projects to remain within agreed budgetary parameters.  Additional capital funding for investment in schools was confirmed on 26 March, as part of a wider review of National Development Plan (NDP) allocations. This will support the continued roll-out of the Department’s ambitious school building programme in communities across the country. There are many accommodation pressures to be managed across the programme, and the Department is currently assessing our work programme and priorities in the context of the updated allocations.  My Department will advise the School Authorities as soon as possible with regard to the progression of the major project to the next stage. ",

[14626/24] ",
        "answerText": " Minister for Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth  Officials in my Department have, in recent months, engaged intensively with members and nominees of the Early Learning and Childcare Stakeholder Forum (ELCSF) in relation to Core Funding Financial Reporting Requirements.  Arising from that engagement, transitional arrangements for financial reporting this year and next were agreed.  The Income and Expenditure Template that my officials now require to be completed as part of these transitional arrangements was shared with providers on 21 December 2023 through the Hive.  Over the same period, my officials also engaged with accountants to finalise guidance in respect of the role of the accountant in financial reporting this year. This guidance was shared on 8 March 2024.  The transitional arrangements, which were agreed, have necessitated substantial changes in the financial reporting portal under development and this has been a factor in the timeline for that work.  Following a meeting with the portal developers, my Department wrote to providers on 15 March to advise that the portal, which will be tested by a number of providers, will open in two stages:  * The portal will be open to providers to register and to link their nominated accountant on or before the 29 April 2024.  * The portal will be open on or before the 31 May 2024 to accept completed Income and Expenditure templates  Given the availability of the portal is later than originally planned, the deadline for submitting completed Income and Expenditure templates will now be 26 June 2024.  In advance of the portal opening, providers can complete the Income and Expenditure template and engage an accountant. I understand many providers have already done this.  As my officials communicated previously, providers that experience difficulty in engaging an accountant to submit the completed Income and Expenditure template by the new deadline will have the option of submitting a draft Income and Expenditure template by 26 June 2024.  Services that avail of this option will need to engage an accountant to submit a final Income and Expenditure template prior to them entering into Core Funding in Year 3.  My Department officials are now focusing on rolling out a suite of supports to providers to fulfil their financial reporting obligations under Core Funding, which will be delivered through local City/County Childcare Committees (CCC).  These supports will include a once-off financial support for targeted services. Further details on these supports are outlined in a detailed FAQ which is available on the Hive.  Financial reporting requirements under Core Funding was a recommendation of the Expert Group in their report ‘Partnership for the Public Good’ who identified the need for robust data to underpin funding policy. These essential data will inform the ongoing development of Core Funding, including preparations for the next Estimates process, ensuring we can continue to make progress on our shared objectives of affordable, quality, inclusive and sustainable early learning and childcare services.

I can confirm as of February 2024 there are 28,155 more staff working in our health service than there were at the beginning of 2020. That’s a 23% increase, meaning that for every 5 people working in the health service in 2020, we now have 6.  The 28,155 increase includes 9,340 nurses and midwives; 4,194 health and social care professionals; and 2,935 doctors and dentists.  We have seen consistent growth in the workforce each year since 2020, with record growth. The workforce growth in 2023 was the highest it has even been since the foundation of the HSE.  In November 2023 the HSE CEO announced a pause on all recruitment with the exception of Consultants, Graduate Nurses and Doctors in formal training programmes.  This recruitment pause put in place was part of a suite of control measures, including an instruction to reduce expenditure on agency staff and management consultants across the HSE. The reality is that the HSE had already exceeded its 2023 funded workforce targets, which was neither affordable nor sustainable. As of the end of February 2024, there were 147,968 staff working in our health service.  The HSE was funded to recruit just over an additional 6,000 staff in 2023, but actually hired 8,239, meaning they were over by more than 2,000 staff than they were funded for.  While the increase in our workforce has been incredibly positive and has enabled significant improvements in service delivery and reductions in waiting times for patients, it is important that the HSE operate within budgeted levels and that prudent controls are in place to ensure the workforce growth is managed in an affordable and sustainable manner.  Funding for an additional 2,268 staff has been secured by the Minister for Health for 2024, which is outlined in the HSE National Service Plan, approved and published on the 14th February 2024. The HSE are currently finalising their Pay and Numbers Strategy for 2024. In additional the HSE has funding for approximately an additional 707 in the disability area.  We await the finalisation of the Pay and Numbers Strategy will enable the HSE to set out its recruitment targets in each area for 2024 and will inform decisions at local level on the filling of available posts, including those returning to work following a career break.

The Roadmap also reflects the ask to public service bodies in the Public Service Transformation 2030 Strategy – Better Public Services , to identify and prioritise actions that support digital inclusion to make sure no one is left behind.  Public service bodies will use digital to improve the off-line experience for those who are unable to consume services digitally.

        "answerText": " Minister for Education  The criteria for the award of incremental credit are set out in the Department’s Circulars 10/2001 for Primary teachers, 29/2007 and 29/2010 for Post-Primary teachers. The criteria for the award of incremental credit to recognised teachers was agreed under the auspices of the Teachers Conciliation Council (TCC).  To qualify for an award of incremental credit, a teacher and their prior work experience being claimed must satisfy the eligibility criteria set out in the relevant circular. An award of incremental credit cannot be made where the eligibility criteria is not satisfied.  When an application for incremental credit is received in the Department, it is checked to ensure that it is fully completed. Applications are managed in date received order.  Applications can take up to 20 weeks to be fully processed but most are dealt with well within this timeframe. Factors that impact on this processing time include incomplete application forms and conflicting information on the application form. Please be advised that if a teacher meets the criteria set out in Circulars 10/2001 for Primary teachers, 29/2007 and 29/2010 for Post-Primary teachers, incremental credit will be awarded and any monies due paid accordingly.  My Department has recently introduced changes to the incremental credit application process. This is on foot of a review of the overall process and is aimed at reducing the processing times of applications resulting in applicants receiving a decision on their application in a shorter time period.

[13071/24] ",
        "answerText": " Minister of State at the Department of Education  Enabling children with special educational needs to receive an education is a priority for this government. It is also a key priority for me as Minister for Special Education & Inclusion, for my department and for the National Council for Special Education (NCSE).  It is my department’s policy, in accordance with the principles of inclusive education, that students with additional learning needs are supported in mainstream classes along with their peers, with additional supports provided as necessary.  My department provides for a range of placement options and supports for schools, which have enrolled students with special educational needs in order to ensure that wherever a child is enrolled, they will have access to an appropriate education.  My department has invested considerably in ensuring that all recognised mainstream schools have been allocated additional special education teaching resources to support them in providing optimal learning experiences for children with special educational needs, including students with a specific learning disability such as dyslexia.  Provision for students is governed by the continuum of support and a range of guidance documents, resources and training opportunities is available to schools to inform their approaches in meeting the needs of students with special educational needs. The most significant of these resources are the 14,500 special education teachers who are employed in schools to provide additional support for children with special educational needs, including dyslexia.  The allocation of special education teachers allows schools to provide additional teaching support for all students who require such support and for schools to deploy resources based on each student’s individual learning need.  The NCSE, through its network of local special educational needs organisers (SENOs), is responsible for processing applications from schools for special educational needs supports as required. The NCSE is aware of emerging need from year to year and where additional provision is required to support schools to meet the needs of children with special educational needs, it is planned and established to meet that need.  In addition, there are specialist educational supports provided by the National Educational Psychological Services (NEPS) and the NCSE to help schools provide an appropriate education for students with special educational needs.  Funding is also made available to schools for the purchase of specialised equipment such as computers and/or software to assist children with special educational needs, including children with a specific learning disability such as dyslexia. This is provided where relevant professionals recommend the equipment as being essential for the provision of education. Schools can apply to the NCSE, through their local SENO for such support.  It is important to note that all classroom teachers at primary level and subject teachers at post-primary level have responsibility for the progress of their students. Where necessary, additional support is provided by special education teachers. The majority of students with significant literacy difficulties currently receive additional teaching support from a special education teacher in a mainstream class. This is provided on the basis of the individual student’s learning need, identified in schools, as opposed to being based on a requirement for a child to have a diagnosis, or an assessment, of a particular disability. These supports are intended to provide students with the highest standard of education.  My department and the NCSE are committed to delivering an education system that is of the highest quality and where every child and young person feels valued and is actively supported and nurtured to reach their full potential.

Deputy Emer Higgins asked the Minister for Justice if her Department has any update regarding owners' management companies (OMCs) legislation, including the publication of new regulations and the appointment of a regulator for OMCs; and if she will make a statement on the matter. [12381/24] ",
        "answerText": " Minister for Justice  The Multi-Unit Developments (MUDs) Act 2011 was enacted with the primary purposes of reforming the law relating to the ownership and management of common areas of multi-unit developments, and facilitating the fair, efficient and effective management of owners' management companies (OMCs).  The Programme for Government contains a commitment to conduct a review of the MUDs Act, to ensure that it is fit for purpose and that it acts in the best interests of residents. Housing for All also provides for Regulations to be made under the MUDs Act relating to the:  • management of annual service charges by OMCs; and  • expenditure incurred of a non-recurring nature by OMCs (i.e. ‘sinking fund’ expenditure).  The work of my Department in relation to multi-unit developments is guided by that of the Department for Housing, Local Government and Heritage, in view of its central role in this area. The importance of policy input from that Department is underlined by a number of important initiatives in relation to multi-unit developments that have recently been brought forward by the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage.  These include the remediation scheme, which Minister O’Brien announced last year, and which will provide support for the remediation of apartments and duplexes with fire safety, structural safety and water ingress defects, constructed between 1991 and 2013. Furthermore, an Interim Remediation Scheme for the funding of emergency fire safety defect works in apartments and duplexes was launched last December and is now open to applications from OMCs.  It is important that the review of the Multi-Unit Developments Act 2011, and the drafting of any Regulations under the Act, would be informed by these key ongoing and priority developments, and as such it is not possible at this point to say when the review of the Act will be completed.  As regards the establishment of a Regulator for OMCs, there are no plans at present to introduce a specific oversight and enforcement mechanism for OMCs. However, it should be noted that OMCs are subject to company law provisions, including their own memorandum of association, and are subject to oversight by the Company Registration Office and the Office of the Director of Corporate Enforcement. Furthermore, the Competition and Consumer Protection Commission also plays a role in providing information and advice to intending purchasers of residential units in multi-unit developments.  In addition, the MUDs Act acknowledges the risk of disputes arising in the enforcement of rights and the performance of obligations imposed by its provisions and makes provision for the resolution of such disputes.  For example, section 24 provides that a person, including any member of an OMC, may apply to the Circuit Court for an Order to enforce any rights conferred or obligations imposed by the Act. Section 24(2) allows the Court to take into account whether the parties have tried to resolve their differences by mediation or other alternative dispute resolution. While section 27 provides for court-directed mediation if the court considers that a ‘mediation conference’ between the parties would assist in reaching a settlement of the matter. ",

[11552/24] ",
        "answerText": " Minister of State at the Department of Health  ADHD has long been recognised as one of the most common psychiatric disorders in children and it is now known to persist into adulthood. Core symptoms include inattention, hyperactivity and impulsivity.  It can cause many issues in areas such as personal and social relations, education and occupation, managing money and organising life in general, there is also an increased risk of having other mental health difficulties with it such as anxiety and depression.  Children can access ADHD assessments through the National Educational Psychological Service. In addition to this, as per the CAMHS Operational Guidelines, CAMHS take referrals for children and adolescents up to age 18 with moderate to severe ADHD.  I am aware that prior to the inception of the National Clinical Programme for Adults with ADHD which I launched in 2021, there were no specific ADHD public services available for Adults in Ireland.  The NCP for ADHD is delivered as part of the HSE’s mental health service provision to ensure an integrated, person-centred response to adults with ADHD. The programme includes both assessment and treatment of the disorder and works collaboratively with voluntary agencies. It envisages a national service of ADHD teams, with each Team comprised of Consultant Psychiatrist, Senior Psychologist, Senior Occupational Therapist, Clinical Nurse Specialist Mental Health, and an administrator.  Enhancement of specialist mental health services such as ADHD is a key priority for myself as a Minister, the Government as a whole and the HSE. Since 2021, over €3 million has been made available for funding ADHD posts from Programme for Government funding. This has enabled the set-up of 5 ADHD Teams with recruitment of over 25 posts, and two more teams are currently in development with posts funded for them.  In addition, as part of the National Clinical Programme adults funding of €150,000 was allocated to facilitate a collaboration with ADHD Ireland and the UCD School of Psychology to develop an ADHD app and the UMAAP Programme (Understanding and Managing Adult ADHD Programme). Both the ADHD App and the UMAAP Programme have proven to be two very positive resources for people with ADHD.  The UMAAP Programme is delivered as a 5-week workshop, and its aim is to provide education and tools for adults on how to manage ADHD.  I am pleased to confirm that further to recent discussions between the Department of Health and the HSE to finalise 2024 mental health funding, ADHD Ireland will be provided with funding for provision of the UMAAP Programme in 2024 and beyond. I look forward to launching the UMAAP Programme in April as agreed with ADHD Ireland. ",

Deputy Emer Higgins asked the Minister for Health to clarify the policy on blood tests as part of monitoring a medical condition for patients holding a medical card or GP visit card; the steps that can be taken to ensure that blood tests necessary for diagnosis and monitoring are covered by the medical card; and if he will make a statement on the matter. [13069/24] ",
        "answerText": " Minister for Health  GP services are provided without charge to people who hold a medical card or GP visit card under the GMS scheme. Under the terms of the current GMS contract, GPs are required to provide eligible patients with ''all proper and necessary treatment of a kind usually undertaken by a general practitioner and not requiring special skill or experience of a degree or kind which general practitioners cannot reasonably be expected to possess.\".  The issue of GPs charging GMS patients for phlebotomy services (blood tests) is complex given the numerous reasons and circumstances under which blood tests are taken. Clinical determinations as to whether a blood test should taken to either assist in the diagnosis of illness or the treatment of a condition are made by the GP concerned. There is no provision under the GMS GP contract for persons who hold a medical card or GP visit card to be charged for such blood tests.  In addition, blood tests undertaken in the context of services provided under the GP Chronic Disease Management Programme are covered by the fees paid to GPs by the HSE for this care.  The issue of certain GPs charging GMS patients for necessary blood tests has been raised with the relevant GP representative body on a number of occasions. However, it has not yet proven possible to achieve agreement that no charges for blood tests would be applied in any circumstances.  Where a patient who holds a medical card or GP visit card believes they have been incorrectly charged for routine phlebotomy services or for a different service by their GP, then that patient should report the matter to their HSE Local Health Office. The local management, upon being notified of potential inappropriate charging of a GMS patient, will contact the GP concerned and carry out an investigation into each complaint and, where appropriate, will arrange for a refund of charges incorrectly applied by the GP.

        "answerText": " Minister for Education  The Physical Activity in Teaching and Learning Pilot Programme was launched on Thursday 22 February 2024 by the Minister for Sport and Physical Education, Thomas Byrne TD.  A lottery system will not be used to select schools to participate in this Pilot Programme. Every application form received will be read and assessed against the stated criteria as set out below. The purpose of the Physical Activity in Teaching and Learning Pilot Programme is to provide an opportunity for schools to be innovative and creative in integrating physical activity into the teaching and learning of a subject area. This is in addition to the physical activity experienced by learners during designated physical education lessons.  This pilot programme recognises the importance of physical activity in teaching and learning, and in health and wellbeing. It acknowledges the role of physical activity as a tool for schools to deliver a school culture and environment that supports the wellbeing of the learners, in line with the Department of Education Wellbeing Policy and Framework for Practice.  The projects undertaken by schools as part of this Pilot Programme will also be used to inform future Department of Education policy developments in relation to physical activity in teaching and learning in schools.  In relation to the assessment process, the Department will establish a panel to evaluate applications. Membership of the panel will include, but is not limited to, a representative from the Department’s Inspectorate, and Curriculum and Assessment Policy Unit.  Applications made by recognised primary, post-primary or special schools that are submitted online before the deadline will be assessed against the following criteria:  • How the project will support the school in integrating physical activity in teaching and learning in the chosen curricular or cross-curricular area (20 marks)  • The benefits the school hopes to gain from participation in the Pilot Programme and how senior leaders in the school will support the project (10 marks)  • How the teachers and school leaders will ensure that learners will play a central role in developing and implementing the project (10 marks)  • The extent to which the project will sustain a long term cultural change in physical activity in teaching and learning in the school (10 marks)  The selection process will also be informed by:  • Geographic national spread  • Urban/rural locations  • Innovation and creativity  • Range of physical activities proposed as part of the application process  • Range of school types (e.g. primary/post-primary, urban/rural, large/small, DEIS/non-DEIS, special/mainstream schools, single sex/co-ed, patron body, etc.  • Inclusion and diversity  • Impact on learning and physical activity levels  Further information on the Physical Activity in Teaching and Learning Pilot Programme is available on the Department of Education website.

        "answerText": " Minister for Social Protection  Under previous taxation law, in the case of a married couple, the husband was considered the assessable spouse and the wife considered the dependant of the husband for income tax purposes.  Accordingly, the Office of the Revenue Commissioners (Revenue) allocated the husband’s Revenue and Social Insurance (RSI) number to the wife of the person concerned, appending the letter W to the end of that number as a second check character.  In this way, the parties could be separately identified yet remain linked for joint income tax assessment purposes.  The Finance Act 1993 provided that either spouse could be the assessable spouse and the practice of allocating “Level W” numbers ceased.  From that point onwards, all persons were allocated unique, individual numbers.  However, it was decided at that stage not to ask all individuals who held “W” numbers to change them until there was a business reason to do so.  The Personal Public Service Number (PPSN) was introduced in the Social Welfare Act 1998, replacing the RSI Number, and my Department was given legislative responsibility for allocating and managing these new numbers.  In practice, previously allocated RSI numbers were retained and became PPSNs, including Level W numbers which were also treated as PPSNs.  The Office of the Revenue Commissioners request holders of Level W numbers to change them once the person needs to engage with them on taxation matters.  The process of replacing a Level W number is relatively straightforward.  My Department verifies the identity of the individual, secures their consent, purges the previously held W number and replaces it with either a new PPSN, or the PPSN the individual held before marriage.  All related pre-existing records are transferred over to the new PPSN.  There are no current plans for an information campaign as my Department engages with individuals who need to change their level W number as such cases arise.  I trust this clarifies the matter for the Deputy. ",

I would like to bring to the attention of the Deputy that, under the Parent’s Leave and Benefit Act 2019 (as amended), working parents are entitled to seven weeks of paid Parents' Leave for each relevant parent, to be taken in the first two years after the birth or adoptive placement of a child. Parent’s Leave and Benefit will increase by a further two weeks to nine weeks by August 2024.  The intention of this leave is to enable parents to spend time with their child in the earliest years. It is deliberately non-transferable between parents to ensure that both parents are encouraged and supported in taking time out from work to spend time with their child. This is further supported through the provision of Parents’ Benefit.  At present, intending parents from a surrogacy agreement may be entitled to Parents’ Leave, depending on their circumstances. The father of a child born through surrogacy can qualify for Parents’ Leave if he is the biological father of the child and declared to be the parent of the child. In these circumstances, the father's partner may qualify for Parents’ Leave if they are married to, or in a civil partnership with, the child’s biological father, or have cohabited with the child’s biological father for over 3 years.

[9981/24] ",
        "answerText": " Minister for Health  Firstly, I want to acknowledge that waiting lists for scoliosis and spina bifida services are unacceptably long. I am acutely conscious of the burden that this places on patients and their families.  I committed €19 million under the 2022 and 2023 Waiting List Action Plans to tackle these waiting lists. This investment has supported an increase in the number of spinal procedures undertaken in both 2022 and 2023, with 509 and 464 procedures carried out respectively, compared to 380 in 2019.  Progress is being made on the waiting lists for spinal procedures, despite the significant increase in demands and referrals compared to previous years. At the end of December 2023 there were 231 children on the waiting for spinal procedures (excluding suspensions), which is a 5% reduction compared to the end of 2022, and 78 active patients waiting over 4 months, which is a 13% reduction compared to the end of 2022. I had hoped, and expected, to see more significant reductions to the waiting lists given the funding that was allocated. However, despite undertaking a record number of spinal procedures over the last two years, the expected reductions in the waiting list were offset by a significant increase in demand and referrals compared to previous years.  At my request, a dedicated Paediatric Spinal Surgery Management Unit has been established in Children's Health Ireland and the Clinical Specialty Lead for Spinal Surgery commenced in post in January 2024. This Unit, which is coordinated cross-city, is focusing on the management and delivery of spinal surgery, including reform of the waiting lists. I have met the clinical lead who is now building up a team around him.  I also intend to convene a dedicated stakeholder taskforce, with an independent chair, for these services. This Taskforce will include all stakeholders, including patient representatives and clinicians. I met with some patient advocacy groups on the 19th of February to discuss the terms of reference for this taskforce.  Patient advocates were clear about what they want this new Taskforce to do and, in collaboration with the advocacy groups, work is progressing on drafting these terms of reference.  I will continue to drive progress on Scoliosis and Spina Bifida services as priority areas under the Waiting List Action Plan 2024. ",

        "answerText": " Minister of State at the Department of Health (Deputy Mary Butler)  As the Deputy will be aware, the Mental Health (Amendment) Bill 2023, which was introduced by Deputy Mark Ward and Deputy David Cullinane, was before Second Stage in the Dáil on 27 February.  The Government proposed a 9-month timed amendment to the Bill, which was approved by Dáil Eireann, to allow for issues contained in the Bill to be further examined, in consultation with Deputies Ward and Cullinane.  As such, there are no plans to include the Mental Health (Amendment) Bill 2023 on the priority legislation list for spring 2024.  Drafting of the Government's Mental Health Bill is in its final months. The forthcoming Government Bill will extend the Mental Health Commission's regulatory powers to all community mental health services, overhaul the involuntary admission and detention process, modernise provisions related to consent to treatment, provide enhanced safeguards for people accessing inpatient treatment, and provide a new, discrete Part that relates exclusively to the care and treatment of children and young people in inpatient settings.  Decisions on what legislation will be prioritised in the spring 2024 session will be decided by Cabinet in the coming weeks, following receipt of recommendations from the Chief Whip. ",

        "answerText": " Minister for Health  The Long-Term Illness (LTI) Scheme was established under Section 59(3) of the Health Act 1970 (as amended). Regulations were made in 1971, 1973 and 1975, prescribing 16 conditions covered by the Scheme. These are: acute leukaemia; mental handicap; cerebral palsy; mental illness (in a person under 16); cystic fibrosis; multiple sclerosis; diabetes insipidus; muscular dystrophies; diabetes mellitus; parkinsonism; epilepsy; phenylketonuria; haemophilia; spina bifida; hydrocephalus; and conditions arising from the use of Thalidomide.  While there are currently no plans to extend the list of conditions, it is important to remember that the LTI Scheme exists within a wider eligibility framework. This Government has put a significant focus on improving access to and the affordability of healthcare services, advancing substantial policy, legislation and investment to deliver expanded eligibility in line with the vision, aims and objectives of Sláintecare.  In 2022, a range of measures were delivered including the abolition of public in-patient charges for children, reductions in the Drug Payment Scheme threshold to €80 per month, and the introduction of free contraception for women aged 17-25.  In 2023, further measures have facilitated better access to affordable, high-quality healthcare, including an expansion of GP care without charges to children aged 6 and 7, and to people earning no more than the median household income, the abolition of all public in-patient hospital charges for adults, and the extension of the free contraception scheme to include women aged 26-30. These measures continue to create a health and social care service that offers affordable access to quality healthcare.  People who cannot, without undue hardship, arrange for the provision of medical services for themselves and their dependants may be eligible for a medical card under the General Medical Services (GMS) Scheme. In accordance with the provisions of the Health Act 1970 (as amended), eligibility for a medical card is determined by the HSE. Medical card eligibility is primarily based on an assessment of means and is not granted on the basis of any particular condition.  In certain circumstances the HSE may exercise discretion and grant a medical card, even though an applicant exceeds the income guidelines, where he or she faces difficult financial circumstances, such as extra costs arising from illness. In circumstances where an applicant is still over the income limit for a medical card, they are then assessed for a GP visit card, which entitles the applicant to GP visits without charge.  Under the Drug Payment Scheme (DPS), no individual or family pays more than €80 a month towards the cost of approved prescribed medicines. The DPS is not means tested and is available to anyone ordinarily resident in Ireland. The DPS significantly reduces the cost burden for families and individuals with ongoing expenditure on medicines.  Individuals may also be entitled to claim tax relief on the cost of their medical expenses, including medicines prescribed by a doctor, dentist, or consultant. Relief is at the standard tax rate of 20%. ",

        "answerText": " Minister of State at the Department of Education  The Assistive Technology Scheme is provided by my Department to supplement the overall approach to providing funding to schools for digital technology and equipment to support children for education purposes. Full details of the scheme are contained in the Department’s Circular 0010/2013.  All equipment provided under this scheme supports children with more complex disabilities who require essential specialist equipment in order to access the school curriculum.  It must be clear that the existing I.T. equipment in the school is insufficient to meet the child's needs. Where necessary, schools may also purchase new or additional equipment or software for students from normal school resources or funds.  Assistive technology is a critical enabler for those with special educational needs to gain the maximum benefit from a modern technologically focused education system. Where children with more complex disabilities require essential specialist equipment to access the school curriculum, which they do not already have, or which cannot be provided for them through the schools existing provisions, schools may make an application for such equipment to the National Council for Special Education (NCSE) under the terms of this scheme.  In order to qualify for equipment under the Assistive Technology Scheme, a student must have been diagnosed with a physical or communicative disability and must also have a recommendation in a professional assessment that the equipment is essential in order to allow the student to access the curriculum.  The type of equipment provided under the Assistive Technology Scheme is varied, and includes audiological supports for students with hearing impairment, braille equipment for children with visual impairment, and computer equipment with associated modified software for students with physical or severe communicative disabilities.  Communication devices or medical or therapy related devices which are not specific educational interventions or equipment specifically required as essential for school educational access, and which have a general application outside of school, are not provided for under the Assistive Technology scheme, however. Such equipment is normally provided for children with disabilities by the Health Service Executive (HSE).  The Department is currently reviewing the Assistive Technology Scheme to ensure that it is working for these children and that the resources are allocated appropriately and as efficiently as possible. The review in ongoing and is expected to complete later this year. ",

This project is being delivered under my Department’s Design and Build Programme and is currently at tender stage.  The Invitation to Tender for the project issued in April 2023, as part of a bundle of projects for 10 schools issued to my Department's Framework of Design and Build Contractors. Given the scale of works involving new purpose-built accommodation for 10 schools, some of which are on campus sites, the tender process involves a very large volume of documentation and drawings and takes approximately 8-12 months. Tender returns have been received and are currently being evaluated.  Given the scale of this investment, this tender evaluation process by the Department's technical staff and project management team takes time to appropriately work through. The Department is very conscious of the importance in getting these projects, including the project for the school referred to by the Deputy, delivered as quickly as possible.  Once a contractor has been appointed, it is anticipated that construction will commence shortly thereafter. My Department will continue to keep the school and its patron body updated as the project progresses.  The large scale capital project for the second school referred to by the Deputy is at Architectural Planning Stage 3 – Tender Action and Award.  The project brief includes a new extension and refurbishment of the existing building, to provide accommodation for 1,000 pupils with classrooms for children with special educational needs.  I want to reassure the Deputy and the school community, that the building project remains a priority for progression.  The Tender report is currently under review by my Department officials and the school authority will be updated when this review is complete.  Until the contractor is appointed, it is not possible to provide an estimated completion date. Once the contractor is appointed, it is expected that it will take approximately 20 months to complete the project. ",

        "answerText": " Minister for Rural and Community Development  Community Centres are the cornerstone of community life in towns and villages around the country. This Government recognises the important role that these centres play in bringing people together and facilitating community services and events.  I have put in place an integrated programme of capital funding supports for the development of infrastructure in rural areas and for the development of community facilities right across the country.  Under the 2022 Community Centre Investment Fund in particular, over €45.8 million was committed for improvement and refurbishment of existing community centres across Ireland. There was a huge uptake of this funding and over 860 different projects are seeing improvements to the fabric of their community centres as a result of this Government initiative.  Following on from this investment, I wanted to assist community groups who are striving to build their own community centre to service their local needs. That is why, in 2023, the focus of the Community Centres Investment Fund moved to new builds. The assessment of these applications is almost complete and I expect to announce the successful projects shortly.  A decision in respect of any further iteration of the Community Centre Investment Fund will be made after the announcement of the successful new build community centre projects.  My Department also administers the Community Recognition Fund, which recognises the huge efforts made by communities in welcoming and supporting people coming to Ireland. Funding of €50 million for some 900 projects is supporting towns and villages nationwide that have welcomed people from Ukraine and other countries.  The Fund aims to support the development of facilities that will be used in the future by all members of the community. Through this initiative, communities are being assisted to develop projects such as large-scale multi-purpose sports facilities, walkways, cycle paths, playgrounds, equipment for sports clubs and community festivals.  Discussions are ongoing with regard to introducing a second iteration of the scheme to further assist impacted communities and I expect to make an announcement shortly.  The CLÁR Programme also provides funding for small-scale projects in designated rural areas that have experienced significant levels of de-population over a defined period. Since the Programme was relaunched in 2016, it has supported a wide range of measures.  Funding of €7.85m was allocated for the 2023 CLÁR programme an increase of €0.5m on 2022.  The 2023 Programme included measures to support:  Developing Community Facilities and Amenities (Measure 1)  Mobility, Cancer Care and Community First Responders Transport (Measure 2)  ‘Our Islands’ (Measure 3)  I hope to launch the 2024 CLÁR programme in the coming months subject to budgetary discussions and a review of measures to be included.  The inclusion of sensory spaces in applications for funding under these schemes will be considered in line with the conditions pertaining to each scheme in any given year. ",

        "showAs": " 77. Deputy Emer Higgins asked the Minister for Social Protection if the expanded child benefit payments up to the age of 19 years includes those in third level education. [7785/24] ",
        "answerText": " Deputy Brendan Griffin  I thank the Minister for her comprehensive response on the previous question.  This question relates to the expansion of child benefit to over-18s in full-time education. Will the Minister outline the changes to the House and address in particular what the technical response will be to people who turn 18 before 1 May of this year? \n Deputy Heather Humphreys  I propose to take Questions Nos. 59, 77 and 107 together.  Child benefit is a universal monthly payment made to families with children up to the age of 16. Currently, the payment continues to be paid in respect of children until their 18th birthday where they are in full-time education or have a disability. In budget 2024, the Government decided to extend the payment of child benefit to 18-year-olds who are in full-time education or have a disability. This was one of my key priorities in the budget.  With many children now starting primary school at age five, together with the increase in pupils doing transition year, there has been an increase in the number of 18-year-olds still in secondary education. I believe the extension of child benefit to 18-year-olds in full-time education is a long-term change for the better and will support families across Ireland into the future.  This is a significant change to the child benefit scheme. It requires technical and operational changes before implementation.  We had originally provided that the change would take effect from September this year. However, I am very pleased that we are now able to bring in this important change from an earlier date and I have secured Government approval to do that. As a result, the measure will be brought in from 1 May. In the region of 60,000 children are expected to benefit from this measure annually. The additional estimated cost of bringing the commencement date forward to May is €21.6 million.  In the case of a child who turned 18 after May 2023 and who is still in full-time education, child benefit will be payable again from May 2024 up to their 19th birthday or until they leave full-time education, whichever is sooner. This might include his or her first year in university. As the measure comes into effect from 1 May, where a child turns 18 in the meantime, there will be no payment for any intervening period up to May 2024, which is the usual approach for changes to the social welfare system that take effect from a future date. The Department will be in contact with these recipients of child benefit over the coming months to advise of the next steps.  To clarify, if your child is in full-time education, be it secondary school or college, you will get the payment until he or she reaches the age of 19 providing he or she can prove he or she is in full-time education. If someone finishes secondary school in June and gets the form signed when he or she goes to college in September to say that he or she is still in either in secondary school or college, the payment will commence in September and it will be backdated for a couple of months in the intervening months. That has always been the case with child benefit because you know that you have to get it certified that your children are in full-time education. Some people have contacted me and told me that their child was 18 in January and they will not get the payment until May but if I had not done this, nobody would have benefitted so it would end at age 18. If I had left it to September, fewer people would have benefitted so in bringing it forward to May, the good news is that every family will benefit from May onwards. We all love to do these things sooner but this is a long-term change for the better. When I announced it last year in the budget, many were disappointed because they thought it was coming in straight away but now I have been able to bring it forward to May. \n Deputy Brendan Griffin  It is very positive news and I commend the Minister on her efforts to ensure that the scheme kicks in on 1 May. It is very welcome and I appreciate the clarification given tonight about a few aspects of it. Doing the sums, it is for the full 12 months for anyone who benefits. It is €1,680, which is a significant amount of money. It is very pertinent that it is happening now because many children are starting school at the age of five and doing the leaving certificate at the age of 18 and beyond whereas previously - certainly in my time - a lot of children might have started school at four so that is something that is relevant. On behalf of my constituents, I really appreciate the efforts made by the Minister and acknowledge the extra €21.6 million she found in the budget to ensure it kicks in on 1 May. It is one of these progressive things the Minister has achieved and I want to acknowledge it. It will be appreciated by people around the country because the year of the leaving certificate and the first year of college is a very expensive year for families so this money will be very useful. \n Deputy Heather Humphreys  This is something the Deputy was very keen for me to improve upon. Child benefit is one of the few tools at my disposal that I can use to support working families. As part of recent budgets, I prioritised the double payments and the lump sum payment on child benefit. As the Deputy noted, children are starting school later. Most children do not start school until they are five and then they do transition year so they are well into 18 before they are finished. I was talking to a woman the other day who told me that she uses child benefit to pay for the grinds for her daughter for the leaving certificate and she was delighted with the change. She is a working mother like most mothers and I am delighted that we were able to give her that bit of help. That is important too. We will have it ready for May and I am glad to be able to do that. \n Deputy Brendan Griffin  I quoted the figure of €1,680 per annum. I assume that in the event of there being bonus payments, the 18-year-olds will benefit from those payments in the same way as any other recipient of the scheme as well should they arise at any particular point. Is that correct? \n Deputy Heather Humphreys  Yes. If you are in payment, you will benefit from any of the double payments we had on child benefit last year. It is €140 per month per child and it is a welcome support to get. I know myself that child benefit covers many a bill or cost that comes into the house. When you are kitting out children for school, it does not matter whether they are 17 or 18. It will still cost the same amount of money to buy things like uniforms when you are getting them ready for school in September. ",
