        "answerText": " Minister for Culture, Communications and Sport  The Complex is a multidisciplinary arts and creative venue in Dublin’s North Inner City, governed by a not-for-profit company limited by guarantee. The Complex has been leasing its building from a private landlord on a site ringfenced for redevelopment.  Proposals for the development of local arts centres are a matter in the first instance for the relevant local authority. County and city development plans are drawn up by local authorities in accordance with their functions under the Planning and Development Acts. This would include policy objectives for development in that county, including the arts.  Annual support, including programming and revenue supports, is provided to arts and culture centres by local authorities and the Arts Council. The Department of Culture, Communications and Sport provides grants as a contribution towards maintaining and enhancing existing arts and culture facilities but does not provide funding for the purchase of buildings.  Officials from my Department met with the Chair of The Complex and other members of the team in December 2024 and advised them of this position. Further communication in June 2025 reiterated that position. No funding was sought from this Department for the purchase of the building by the Complex and any refurbishment support would require chargeable title to be in place. ",

        "showAs": " 5. Deputy Mary Lou McDonald asked the Taoiseach when the Cabinet committee on Northern Ireland will next meet. [63430/25] ",
        "answerText": " The Taoiseach  I propose to take Questions Nos. 1 to 13, inclusive, together.  The Cabinet subcommittee on Northern Ireland was created on 18 February 2025 to oversee implementation of relevant programme for Government commitments and ongoing developments in relation to Northern Ireland, Irish-British relations, and the shared island initiative. As well as considering issues relevant to the Government's position as a co-guarantor of the Good Friday Agreement, including our role in Good Friday Agreement institutions such as the North-South Ministerial Council, the British-Irish Council and the British-Irish Intergovernmental Conference, topics for discussion also include the annual UK-Ireland summits and their agreed programme of work and the continued roll-out and development of the investment, research and dialogue strands of the shared island initiative.  On 17 October, I chaired the 30th plenary meeting of the North-South Ministerial Council in Farmleigh House, Dublin. The Northern Ireland Executive was led by the First Minister, Michelle O'Neill, MLA, and the deputy First Minister, Emma Little-Pengelly, MLA. We had constructive discussions on areas of mutual issues, including business and trade matters, infrastructure and investment co-operation, and tackling gender-based violence. Our discussion also included a new agenda item on emergency planning and preparedness. We also had updates by all Ministers on North-South co-operation under their portfolios, ranging from day-to-day cross-Border engagement to major infrastructural projects. The event was preceded by a dinner at Farmleigh with Government and Northern Ireland Ministers on 16 October.  On 18 November, the Government announced allocations of over €50 million from the shared island fund for ten new projects to be delivered as part of the initiative over 2026 to 2030. Among the projects are €14 million for a major new shared island media initiative to be taken forward by Coimisiún na Meán, €5.9 million to develop cross-Border emergency management capacity on flood response and rescue operations, particularly with resources for technology and so forth, and €2 million to enable a new Dublin-Derry PSO air service to start in 2026.  Next week, along with the Tánaiste, I will attend a summit meeting of the British-Irish Council in Wales where the focus of our discussions will be on the creative industries across these islands. The Cabinet committee on Northern Ireland will continue to meet biannually on these and related matters. We will be meeting again next on 8 December. \n An Ceann Comhairle  I ask Members to please be brief and concise, as the Taoiseach needs to respond. \n Deputy Brendan Smith  I thank the Taoiseach for his reply. As he is aware, there was a general welcome for the legacy framework that was published jointly by the Irish and British Governments in early September. Could he let us know what progress is being made in bringing forward the necessary legislation to enact that framework and to ensure that all of these issues are dealt with through putting the victims first and at the centre of the framework and the modus operandi of dealing with these legacy issues?  Another thing I have consistently raised is the Belturbet bombing of December 1972 and the Dublin-Monaghan bombings of 1974. Again, the British Government has not co-operated to the extent necessary to ensure a comprehensive investigation into the Dublin-Monaghan bombings. Will the Taoiseach let us know if that will continue to be on the agenda in all discussions at Government level with his British counterparts? \n Deputy Erin McGreehan  I would like the Taoiseach to outline whether the Cabinet committee discussed the cross-Border economy, particularly in counties such as Louth where these issues are felt most acutely. Will there be specific actions in relation to tax and administrative complications facing cross-Border workers, including the differentiations between the pricing of alcohol and fuel between both jurisdictions and the impact of that in the distortion of local trade and the undermining of businesses and broader communities?  I support my colleague Deputy Smith in relation to the bombings. I also highlight that it will have been 50 years this December since the Dundalk bombing where people tragically lost their lives. \n Deputy Barry Heneghan  Regarding the cross-Border organisation Foras na Gaeilge, if it had the same growth as the Arts Council, Foras na Gaeilge's budget would now be €50 million. Instead of that, níl sé ach €17 milliún. I welcome the raise in the recent budget to Foras na Gaeilge's funding, but how will the Taoiseach ensure that this additional funding is made available, given that 25% of it is from the North? \n Deputy Ruairí Ó Murchú  I have often brought up the positives regarding the shared island unit. I believe the project in relation to DkIT and its partnership with Queen's University Belfast could fit into that. However, a number of other issues arise, whether we are talking about the remote working issues that have an impact on taxation or exam certification. In fairness to Deputy McGreehan, she has brought up the issue of the disparity regarding fuel. I have spoken before about the need for some sort of means of putting these issues on the agenda properly and dealing with them.  We have made the call for a long time to get down to the issue of constitutional change and the need for a means - call it a citizens' assembly or a forum - by which this conversation can happen. The State must properly prepare for Irish unity. There has been an abject failure to do so and we cannot just wait until everybody gets on together. We need to prepare now and the onus is on the State to do it. \n Deputy Cormac Devlin  I thank the Taoiseach for the update on the work of the Cabinet subcommittee. As Cathaoirleach of the Committee on the Implementation of the Good Friday Agreement, we have had good engagements North and South. That is continuing next week with visiting MPs from Westminster. Dialogue is important in terms of the Government's good relationship with London as well as Belfast.  May I also raise the case of the 265 students and teachers who were kidnapped in Niger state in Nigeria? It is a very serious case and I would like to know what is happening there. \n Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett  Last week, I raised with the Taoiseach - I want to do so again because it is important - the fact that, as part of a wider attack by the British Government on those standing in solidarity with the people of Palestine and against Israel's genocide in Gaza, people in the North are being arrested and charged, including one of our councillors, Councillor Shaun Harkin in Derry, for indicating supporting support for Palestine Action. The designation by the Starmer Government of Palestine Action as a terrorist group is outrageous when what the group has been trying to do is stop Israeli terrorism and genocide by trying to disrupt the ability of the British state and Israeli companies to collaborate with Israel in the genocidal assault on the people of Palestine. It is happening in the North. Arrests are taking place. There was a protest this weekend where people declared their support for Palestine Action. It should not be a chargeable offence and the Taoiseach should speak out against it. \n Deputy Paul Murphy  For 15 months, an Irish citizen from County Antrim has been held without trial in an English prison and has had his rights denied. Jordan Devlin is being locked inside for 23 and a half hours per day. He is being strip searched twice daily. His mail has been withheld, his visits are blocked and his calls are denied. His sister said, \"They put him on public protection so he can't speak to anyone\". She also said:  They often don’t have vegetarian food so he can't eat. They're x-raying him and strip-searching him twice a day. He's freezing too.  He is a Palestine solidarity activist. He is charged with regard to a protest action at Elbit Systems. Elbit is the largest supplier of weapons to the Israeli genocide. He denies all the charges. His trial begins today but his judge was swapped out yesterday with no stated justification. The question is whether the Irish Government has made any representations on his behalf and whether the Taoiseach has sought to ensure that his basic rights as a prisoner and a defendant are defended as opposed to being ridden roughshod over like many other Palestine protesters. \n Deputy Ivana Bacik  I thank the Taoiseach for the update. I welcome the developments with the shared island fund. It is now clearer than it has ever been that conversations about the constitutional future of the island are picking up steam. I would dispute the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland's recent claim that there was no appetite for constitutional change in Northern Ireland. I see that the leader of the SDLP Claire Hanna and others contested that claim. In the absence of leadership from the British Government and in keeping with the principles in the Good Friday Agreement-Belfast Agreement, it is essential for our Government to take on a role of preparing in earnest for the work necessary to lay the groundwork and foundations for running a referendum on unity. We need a clear timeline to allow for that necessary groundwork to take place, to develop Green and White Papers, to allow for the work of citizens' assemblies to take place and to see progress made building on the work of the shared island unit in advance of the 30th anniversary of the Good Friday Agreement-Belfast Agreement. The Taoiseach said that the next meeting of the Cabinet subcommittee would be on 8 December. As we approach 2028, what substantive steps will that Cabinet subcommittee be announcing in terms of bringing the debate further? \n Deputy Rose Conway-Walsh  At last week's session of the Committee on the Implementation of the Good Friday Agreement, we had a profound contribution from the All-Island Cancer Research Institute and the All-Island Congenital Heart Disease Network. It highlighted once again what we have known for some time, namely, that lives can be saved and healthcare can only be delivered to an optimum level across the island when we have an all-island approach to healthcare for the 7 million people living on the island. It makes zero sense on a small island such as ours financially or otherwise to have two healthcare systems operating simultaneously. Until such time as we have a referendum on Irish unity and an opportunity to design a new and modern all-island, world-class service, I ask the Taoiseach and the Minister for Health to set aside a permanent allocation in the health budget for the delivery of healthcare on an all-island basis, utilising North-South collaboration to improve outcomes for patients in both jurisdictions and maximise the wonderful clinical expertise on the island. \n Deputy Eoin Hayes  The renewed calls for a border poll on reunification in recent months point to a definite direction of travel on the issue of a united Ireland and on that question moving from the realm of the idealistic to the practical. My party and I would welcome the opportunity to advocate for reunification and believe that a united Ireland achieved by truly informed communities North and South in a process defined by consent and deliberative consensus has the real potential to benefit the people of the entire island. However, I am concerned that as the chances of a border poll in the next ten or 15 years continue to rise to that of political inevitability, we are running out of time to ensure it takes place in such an environment. Will the Government commit to the establishment of citizens' assemblies, work towards cross-Border fora on health, economics and education and set out a positive vision? \n Deputy Peadar Tóibín  The purpose of the British legacy Bill was to grant to amnesty to those who had killed innocent civilians. There appears to be a significant contradiction in the position of the Irish and British Governments in the new joint framework that seeks to replace that. The British Government is briefing that there will be safeguards for British army veterans. I asked Simon Harris this question and he said that was separate from the joint framework and that the British were looking for their own safeguards in their own legislation. Would that separate treatment for British army veterans not undermine a joint framework? Would it not create a lop-sided justice system in the Six Counties? Will that protection for veterans apply to both sides of the conflict? Will the British secretary of state retain a veto over the disclosure of the role of paid British agents in the Troubles and will former RUC officers who played a significant role in the Troubles be part of the investigative system that is put in place? \n Deputy Conor D. McGuinness  Tá Coimisinéir Teanga nua ceaptha sna Sé Chontae, Pól Deeds. Is coiscéim chun tosaigh é seo i ndiaidh tréimhse an-fhada ag feitheamh dá leithéid. Tá Gaeilge agus pobal na Gaeilge faoi ionsaí sna Sé Chontae faoi láthair. Conas a dhéanfaidh an Taoiseach cosaint ar an bpobal seo, ar lucht labhartha na Gaeilge ó Thuaidh?  While I am on my feet, I want to raise the situation of Jordan Devlin, an Irish citizen from County Antrim who is on remand in Britain awaiting charges relating to pro-Palestinian activism there. I see this in the wider context of a crackdown on political dissent and political protest in Britain. Has the Taoiseach raised, or will he raise, this situation with the British authorities to ensure he is treated fairly in prison and will be afforded a fair trial? \n The Taoiseach  I thank all of the Deputies for raising a variety of issues. Deputy Brendan Smith was first up. In respect of the legacy framework, the measures announced in the joint framework were published in September and provide a pathway to truth and accountability. That is why I went to London to meet Keir Starmer. It was one of those trips. I take it that people accept that we have to go to London every now and again to meet the Prime Minister. It was to make sure we got the legacy Bill over the line because it is an important piece of legislation that is certainly far superior to the previous legacy Act of the last British Government.  The British Government published the Bill amending the 2023 legacy Act on 14 October, so that is the progress the Deputy was asking for. The second reading of that Bill took place in the House of Commons on 18 November. To be fair, we believe that represents speed and demonstrates the seriousness with which they are approaching this essential work. The key test for us will be whether it faithfully reflects what is in the joint framework. The Minister, Deputy McEntee, and the UK secretary of state, Hilary Benn, discussed the legacy framework in their introductory call last week.  The Tánaiste and the Minister, Deputy O'Callaghan, also discussed this with the secretary of state, Mr. Benn, at the British-Irish Intergovernmental Conference, which took place on 17 November because we, too, have responsibilities in this jurisdiction. While we can only legislate once the UK legislation is enacted, the Minister for justice, Jim O'Callaghan, has said he is hopeful that the general scheme of the Bill will be published in April or May of next year. Enabling reciprocal co-operation between the two jurisdictions is absolutely at the heart of the agreed joint framework on legacy. The Garda Commissioner is also committed to the establishment by the end of this year of a dedicated unit as a central point of contact in relation to Troubles-related investigations undertaken by An Garda Síochána. That is also in the joint framework. An Garda Síochána has also committed, where possible, to answer questions that a family may have in relation to the investigation of a Troubles-related incident and provide a report to the family.  In respect of the Belturbet and Dublin-Monaghan bombings, the publication of the Denton report may very well shed light on the Dublin-Monaghan bombings. We have to await the outcome of that. I know it is into the Glenanne Gang and the atrocities they perpetrated, but that will be important. I know that Deputy Smith has been a strong advocate on the Belturbet and Dublin-Monaghan bombings.  Deputy McGreehan raised a very important point about the treatment for tax purposes of workers who cross the Border. We do not have that resolved yet. There have been ongoing issues, or attempts to do that, between the respective Departments of finance and I am pushing through the cross-Border bodies and through the Department of Finance to get some progress on that. We are also working with employers and unions through the LEEF process to see can we make progress on it. It is an issue for the seamless transfer of workers North to South and South to North.  It is more difficult in terms of harmonisation of prices North and South. Different Governments have different policies. I have not seen today's budget in respect of the UK yet but that could even bring in more taxation. We do not know how that will manifest.  I am conscious also that it is 50 years since the Dundalk bombing.  Maidir le ceist an Teachta Heneghan, tá deacracht ann toisc an gaol atá ann. Tá dualgas ar an Executive airgead a chur ar fáil d’Fhoras na Gaeilge agus caithfimid an rud céanna a dhéanamh. Is féidir linn níos mó a chur ar fáil. Trí shared island, tá níos mó á dhéanamh againn, maraon leis an méid atá ag teacht go hoifigiúil ón Rialtas, chun gnóthaí trí Ghaeilge a chothú agus tacaíocht a thabhairt. Mar sin beimid ag déanamh sin. I will come back to the shared island initiative later.  Deputy Ó Murchú and others raised constitutional issues and so on. I think reconciliation cannot be postponed, Deputy. \n Deputy Ruairí Ó Murchú  I did not say it could be. \n The Taoiseach  The Deputy kind of said we could not wait. \n Deputy Ruairí Ó Murchú  The Taoiseach said waiting on a perfect----- \n The Taoiseach  I know. I am not trying to----- \n Deputy Ruairí Ó Murchú  He said we wait on a perfect----- \n An Ceann Comhairle  Deputy, please. The Taoiseach is answering the questions. \n The Taoiseach  I just think we need to really focus on reconciliation on a constant, constant basis. \n Deputy Ruairí Ó Murchú  That is okay. \n The Taoiseach  It is hard work but it does bear great fruit in terms of the North and South and different traditions and political backgrounds within the North as well. \n Deputy Peadar Tóibín  It is more likely to happen in a united Ireland. \n An Ceann Comhairle  Deputy, this is not a back and forth. \n The Taoiseach  It is very important that we consistently do that. I do not think citizens' assemblies are in any shape or form an appropriate route for discussing the future of Ireland or the constitutional framework into the future. \n Deputy Ruairí Ó Murchú  In a forum. \n Deputy Peadar Tóibín  The New Ireland Forum. \n The Taoiseach  I just do not believe it at all, because anyone who knows anything about the North - and I have been involved all my life politically; I have been involved in discussions about the devolution of justice, for example, and I was in the Government when the Good Friday Agreement was first signed - knows it means people-to-people engagement. It means political parties engaging. It means political traditions as well as independent politicians or people who have a view. Citizens' assemblies can be closed enough in some respects and they can be a percentage of a random percentage of the population. There were some good citizens' assemblies but for something as overarching as a future constitutional framework - I just want to give my view on this - from my experience, it simply would not cut it. You would end up with a report----- \n Deputy Peadar Tóibín  The New Ireland Forum. \n Deputy Ruairí Ó Murchú  Then come up with an alternative. \n An Ceann Comhairle  Sorry, there is a structure on this debate. \n The Taoiseach  What I am always amused by----- \n Deputy Peadar Tóibín  We are just giving suggestions. \n An Ceann Comhairle  It is not allowed. \n The Taoiseach  Fianna Fáil as a party has committed to the North with great substance over the years - Charles Haughey, Albert Reynolds and Bertie Ahern in terms of the Good Friday Agreement. In this Government and the last, we did something that has never been done in the shared island initiative. Some €1 billion from 2020 to 2025 and beyond and another €1 billion in this programme for Government, which is bringing real substance. Instead of all the rhetoric and everything else, we are doing things. Part of that has also been a very important investment in real research into the different systems North and South - into our health systems, into education completion, into energy, into enterprise, and into ecology and climate. Good stuff has been done by the Economic and Social Research Institute. I defy the Deputies to go back over the last 100 years and come up with anything that parallels the level of research we have undertaken to try to understand better the different systems and different approaches.  Now, I will put a challenge to Sinn Féin. It has been talking about this for decades but it has not produced a scrap of paper in terms of----- \n Deputy Ruairí Ó Murchú  That is not true. \n Deputy Rose Conway-Walsh  That is not true. \n The Taoiseach  One second, please. I am just trying to make a point. \n Deputy Rose Conway-Walsh  Yes, but it is not the truth. \n An Ceann Comhairle  It is not a back and forth. \n Deputy Rose Conway-Walsh  Do not tell untruths. \n The Taoiseach  In terms of a blueprint, why is Sinn Féin afraid to bring forward a blueprint? \n Deputy Rose Conway-Walsh  You are the Taoiseach. \n An Ceann Comhairle  There are seven other Deputies, Taoiseach. \n Deputy Rose Conway-Walsh  You are the leader. \n The Taoiseach  I know. \n An Ceann Comhairle  It is not a back and forth. \n The Taoiseach  We are taking our responses in terms of the Good Friday Agreement. \n Deputy Conor D. McGuinness  You lead the Government. \n The Taoiseach  I believe in the unity of the Irish people, okay,----- \n An Ceann Comhairle  Seven other Deputies, Taoiseach. \n The Taoiseach  -----but I would say to the Deputies that with everything Sinn Féin does, the onus is on the Government. The Government will take its responsibilities in relation to this but----- \n Deputy David Cullinane  I have brought forward a plan for healthcare. I will send it on to you. \n The Taoiseach  -----fo a party I would have thought was so committed as Sinn Féin is rhetorically - it keeps going on about it - it has produced very little in terms of what it believes the blueprint should be. \n Deputy Rose Conway-Walsh  We have done several studies. \n An Ceann Comhairle  Just to remind----- \n The Taoiseach  That is the point I would make----- \n Deputy Ruairí Ó Murchú  And we have engaged. \n The Taoiseach  -----because the party always wants us to produce the blueprint. \n Deputy Ruairí Ó Murchú  That is because we are not in power. \n The Taoiseach  By the way, Fianna Fáil will not be found wanting, nor will other parties, in terms of delivering substance in respect of this issue. \n Deputy Ruairí Ó Murchú  You are the Government. \n An Ceann Comhairle  Taoiseach, just to remind you there are seven other Deputies. \n The Taoiseach  That is covering all the seven really. There are a good few----- \n Deputy Peadar Tóibín  But it is not getting us anywhere. \n An Ceann Comhairle  No, the next seven, including Deputy Boyd Barrett. \n The Taoiseach  Deputy Devlin made a very important point and he has done very good work as Chair of the Good Friday committee. I certainly think he is correct in respect of what has happened in Nigeria. At the European Union-African Union Summit, that was raised in terms of what Boko Haram and various jihadist groups were doing in terms of the persecution and killing of many people, but Christians as well, and the kidnapping of young girls and so on. I appreciate the point the Deputy raised there.  To Deputy Boyd Barrett on the issues around Palestine Action, all of our embassies and so on provide whatever consular supports to any Irish citizen who is on remand or in prison. We always provide whatever supports we can or whatever assistance but we do not and obviously cannot interfere in the criminal justice system. I will review the case of Jordan Devlin and I will ask again our ambassador in London for an update in respect of that. \n Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett  You should speak out against Starmer's policy. \n An Ceann Comhairle  Please, Deputy. \n Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett  It is a disgraceful policy. \n The Taoiseach  I have no issue with people - obviously, I do not - supporting Palestinians. I do have an issue - I am not saying this happened in these cases at all because I do not know the full detail of them - but I read recently of a case where there was a ramming of building in London, so it is not as black and white as the Deputy has articulated, or even here where people drive through gates and barriers and do criminal damage. TDs' offices have had criminal damage by, I would say, more extreme elements of people who were involved in supporting the Palestinian movement, unfortunately. It is true. My own office was damaged three times. I know other TDs whose offices were damaged. \n Deputy Erin McGreehan  Hear, hear. \n The Taoiseach  So, is that acceptable? Is that legitimate protest? No, it is not. When there are people working in those offices, they do not think it is legitimate. All I am saying is we all have to be clear on the demarcation line. I am not familiar with the individual cases here in terms of the alleged crimes and so on like that, but let us not try to pretend that everything is just all one way because----- \n Deputy Paul Murphy  But in Britain, if you just hold a sign saying \"Free Palestine Action\", you can be arrested. \n An Ceann Comhairle  Please, Deputy Murphy. \n The Taoiseach  -----one thing I do know----- \n Deputy Paul Murphy  That is crazy. \n An Ceann Comhairle  This is orchestrated. I ask you to stop interrupting. \n The Taoiseach  One thing I do know is either on the far right or the far left, people do transgress the lines and let us not pretend they do not. They have in this country in the past. There clearly are other issues in the UK----- \n Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett  I think you will find the Israelis are the transgressors. \n The Taoiseach  -----and so on like that. Look, some people were trying to stop Dublin Port the other day. \n Deputy Paul Murphy  And they got bashed, did they not? \n An Ceann Comhairle  Taoiseach, I do not know if you intend to take any other questions. \n Deputy Paul Murphy  They got battered by gardaí, did they not? \n The Taoiseach  Well, they should not be trying to stop----- \n Deputy Paul Murphy  Did the Taoiseach support the gardaí battering them? \n The Taoiseach  Some 80% of trade in this country goes through Dublin Port and you guys want to wreck it. That is bread on the table. Workers all over the country depend on trade going through Dublin Port. As far as the Deputies are concerned, that should be stopped in its tracks. There are demarcation lines that we have to be very clear about. The right to protest----- \n Deputy Paul Murphy  They were protesting trade with Israel. \n The Taoiseach  -----is a sacred right in this country. We should cherish that and we should never do anything to damage it, nor should others.  I think I have dealt with the issue Deputy Bacik raised in my general response. I do not believe a citizens' assembly is the right way to go.  Deputy Conway-Walsh spoke about the cancer consortium. I helped to set that up originally. We are supporting it. On congenital heart disease, there was a very good agreement and there are cross-Border health initiatives including, for example, an initiative to treat children's hearts in Crumlin. There is more we can do. There is a cancer centre at Altnagelvin. I do not know if the Deputy has seen that. The Republic provided a lot of funding for that. There are also other services. I am all for that. We are researching whether we can provide better primary care services North and South and whether hospital resources can be combined. Deputy McGreehan made a point to me about two hospitals, one of which was Daisy Hill Hospital, where more stuff could be done. We have been working on that through various initiatives. I am all for that. We will continue to do that in conjunction with the ESRI and NESC.  I have given my views on the issue raised by Deputy Eoin Hayes. We have established all-island forums through the shared island initiative. Through that initiative, we have created a climate and biodiversity network, an all-island women's forum and an all-island youth forum where young people get together and talk about the future and about their lives. We have also developed the first all-island music archive, combining music from different traditions in the one archive. That is being funded through the shared island unit. There is a lot happening on the ground. People are just getting together. I was at an event two weeks ago. It was fantastic. People from east Belfast were doing tapestries with people from Inishbofin. Some of them had never been in the Republic before. Some of those from the South had never been in the North. We have a long way to go but we need to do this right and properly.  To respond to Deputy Conor McGuinness, is maith an rud é go bhfuil an coimisinéir teanga nua ann sa Tuaisceart. Tá Acht ann anois. Tá reachtaíocht curtha i láthair. Is dócha go bhfuil an-chuid oibre le déanamh ag an gcoimisinéir chun é sin a chur i bhfeidhm. Níl an reachtaíocht sin lán-cosúil leis an reachtaíocht atá againn anseo. Más féidir linn aon tacaíocht a thabhairt dó agus do ghluaiseacht na Gaeilge sa Tuaisceart, beimid sásta é sin a dhéanamh. Tá a lán déanta againn ach táimid sásta i bhfad níos mó a dhéanamh. \n Deputy Peadar Tóibín  Will the Taoiseach address the lopsided protections for veterans? \n The Taoiseach  Again, they were not negotiated by this Government, nor are they part of the joint framework. It is our understanding that the accommodation made for witnesses should apply in the cases of all victims equally, regardless of the perspective being brought to the matter. \n Deputy Peadar Tóibín  It is a problem then. \n An Ceann Comhairle  The Taoiseach has another 15 minutes. Did he answer Deputy McGuinness's question? \n The Taoiseach  I did. \n An Ceann Comhairle  You did. I am sorry; I was distracted. I would like to welcome a member of the Down's syndrome community, Declan Moran, who is here with Deputy Albert Dolan. You are very welcome, Declan. \n The Taoiseach  You are very welcome, Declan. ",

        "answerText": " The Taoiseach  I propose to take Questions Nos. 17 to 31, inclusive, together.  Our programme for Government sets out an ambitious agenda for building our shared island. Yesterday, the Government made a major funding commitment of over €50 million through our shared island fund to ten new programmes.  We are investing for the future to improve people’s lives and strengthen connections across the island of Ireland . We are moving forward with €14 million for a major new shared island media initiative by Coimisiún na Meán, delivering on our programme for Government commitment to resource schemes to encourage cross-Border journalism on an ongoing basis;  A sum of €5.9 million is being allocated to the fire and emergency services from North and South to deepen their co-operation to enhance capacity and training on management of flooding events  and on search and rescue operations. There will be €6 million for the new shared home place programme, which will foster a sustained, broad engagement with all communities on this island and with our diaspora on the island of Ireland’s diverse heritage, and how this can shape our shared future. Funding of €14.5 million is being allocated for an expanded creative lreland shared island programme and arts projects. There will be a €1.8 million contribution to the next phase of the all-Ireland pollinator plan to protect the island’s unique biodiversity.  Ministers are also working with confirmed shared island fund resourcing to establish a new air link between Derry and Dublin next year; support development of new cross-Border and Border region greenway routes; deepen our co-operation with Northern Ireland Executive counterparts on tackling bovine TB, the information service for cross-Border workers and commercialising research. The Government also yesterday, as part of the national development plan review, published our shared island investment priorities across virtually all sectors out to 2035, backed by our shared island fund and other resourcing.  The iconic Narrow Water Bridge and Ulster Canal restoration projects are forging ahead. Next year, Government resourcing will enable commencement of construction of a new teaching building at Ulster University in Derry and continue the transformative hourly frequency Dublin to Belfast rail service. In April, I launched a new phase of my Department’s joint research programme with the Economic and Social Research Institute, ESRI, with a focus on strategic policy and co-operation considerations for the island, and research projects for 2025-26 are under way. This includes a new annual report series by the ESRI assessing economic trends across the island of Ireland, which will be published next month.  Through our shared island Initiative, the Government will continue to invest in strategic all-island co-operation and deepen our partnership with the Executive and UK Government as we work every day to build reconciliation between the different traditions of this island. \n Deputy Erin McGreehan  The shared island unit has real potential and has had real results and benefits for County Louth and the country, as the Taoiseach said, in terms of the arts, emergency services and biodiversity. Yesterday's announcement that Dundalk Institute of Technology, DKIT, will gain university status alongside Queen's University Belfast is incredibly exciting news. It will be transformative for the north east, and will be a really complementary match-up with Queen's University as well. This is a huge opportunity for the shared island unit to invest in the future, to invest in our young people and to invest in our economy and our industry.  I wish to ask the Taoiseach about the investment in people and about deeper health care co-operation with our neighbours in the North. There have to be synergies and opportunities there that we can look at with Daisy Hill Hospital in Newry and even further afield in Dundalk. We can start looking at how we can look after the communities in the Cooley Peninsula, Carlingford and Omeath, and how we can reflect this in our usual daily life and health care. They do not match up at the minute and we can do more. \n Deputy Cormac Devlin  I thank the Taoiseach for the reply and in particular the announcement of €50 million for the new projects, which is very welcome. We need to see more of the practical people-focused projects like those. The Taoiseach mentioned the Dublin-Derry link among other initiatives. The Enterprise rail link between Dublin and Belfast has proven very popular. I ask that it be considered to extend that further to support the night-time economy of both cities. That would be a very important move.  In the same spirit, the announcement by Minister for higher education, Deputy Lawless, of a major new partnership between Dundalk IT and Queen's University, establishing DKIT as a University College of Queen's University is a landmark development for higher education and for the Dublin-Belfast corridor. Will the Taoiseach set out how these shared island allocations and DKIT-Queen's partnership will be aligned as part of a cohort plan for the Dublin-Belfast corridor? Will the Taoiseach confirm that the necessary policy and legislative frameworks will be brought to Government early in 2026 so that students, staff and local communities can see these benefits on the ground as quickly as possible? \n Deputy Paul Murphy  I will quote the Taoiseach who told an international audience at COP30:  The science is undeniable. Temperatures are rising, and the clock is ticking. If we are not prepared to tell our citizens the truth about this, we are failing them, and this planet, in the most profound way.  Has the Taoiseach tried telling the truth to the big dairy farmers and the big dairy processors who are driving up carbon emissions and are polluting our waterways, North and South? I have raised the issue previously in terms of Lough Neagh. Lough Derg is the latest of our lakes to turn neon green, a 41st shade of green that the Taoiseach will not be plámásing world leaders about. The main cause is nutrient pollution from agriculture, accelerated by the nitrates derogation. When will the Taoiseach tell the truth that environmental protection and intensive for-profit animal agriculture are incompatible, that we need to reduce the number of dairy cattle, that we need to compensate farmers with a herd reduction scheme and that the nitrates derogation must go? \n An Ceann Comhairle  I will just pause the clock for a minute. We have only eight minutes left in this session and we cannot go over time, I am afraid. I do not have that discretion for Taoiseach's Questions. I will have to limit each Member's contribution to 30 seconds give the Taoiseach an opportunity to respond. \n Deputy Ruairí Ó Murchú  I would like to bring up the fabulous news about the partnership between DKIT and Queen's University. We are talking about a greater level of provision of undergraduate and postgraduate programmes and an innovation and research hub to be based in Dundalk. We know that this can definitely develop the Dublin-Belfast corridor. There is a necessity to follow through with legislative support. Beyond that, this could be part of a vital shared island project. I would like to know what will happen in that regard. \n Deputy Michael Murphy  The question of greater North-South integration and any future constitutional change carries profound economic implications. It is really important that we approach this debate with honesty and clarity. Further integration will require significant investment, aligning public services, connecting infrastructure, integrating health and education and ensuring social welfare compatibility. If we are to maintain public confidence, we need transparent, independent economic analysis. We need to be honest about the challenges and the opportunities. \n Deputy Liam Quaide  In recent times we have seen an alarming escalation in racist violence against immigrants and minority communities both North and South of this island. According to An Garda Síochána statistics, race crimes and related incidents rose by 24% between 2021 and 2024. There were similar increases in such crimes in the North between July 2024 and June of this year. Amnesty International has described this period in the North as \"a year of hate and fear\". There is a striking similarity of experiences of minorities both North and South in respect of these increased threats. There is also clear potential to collaborate on an all-island basis. What initiatives are under way or planned to help support integration through communities North and South to help them learn from each other in terms of best practice? \n Deputy Shane Moynihan  Yesterday's announcement is very welcome in terms of the infrastructure foundations put in place to harness the economic potential of the shared island. Part of that, which we have discussed in this House, is the role of the all-island labour market and the need for focus and skills. I would love to hear from the Taoiseach about what engagement is happening with the Northern Ireland Executive with regard to building up the SME sector across both sides of the island. They will be the fabric that knit the economic fabric of this island together in creating the shared island and creating a shared and united future for all. What schemes are being put in place to incentivise and promote that? \n Deputy Rose Conway-Walsh  I commend the work of Dublin City University, Aberdeen University and University College Dublin on the constitutional deliberations from grassroots that is being done by Dr. Shelley Deane, Professor Joanne McEvoy and Professor Jennifer Todd. I raise this because this work has been done with focus groups in Mayo, Bellaghy, Longford, Cookstown and Monaghan. The shared island unit, which is very much welcome, is doing work on women and the Constitution. I ask that the unit uses this academic work to underpin what the unit is going to do. The credibility of the work the academics are doing would really carry this forward. Why has it not got academic underpinning? \n Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett  Across Britain and the North of Ireland people are being arrested, prosecuted and, in some cases, imprisoned because they support Palestine Action, on the basis that the British Government has designated Palestine Action, a group campaigning against British complicity with the genocide that Israel is committing, as a terrorist organisation. It is absolutely outrageous. There will be a protest this Saturday in Belfast as people stand in solidarity with it. Sally Rooney has written an article in The Guardian this week about prisoners being close enough to being tortured in British prisons who are in prison awaiting trial on this. Will the Taoiseach speak out against the British Government's outrageous decision to designate protesting against genocide as somehow terrorism? \n Deputy Peadar Tóibín  BBC Northern Ireland runs a podcast called \"Borderline\". The podcast is part of the significant debate on Irish unity that is happening across the country. One of the themes of that podcast is the fact that the Irish Government is not participating in that discussion.  Many voices have stated there is a serious reluctance from the Government to even discuss the issue of Irish unity. The debate has moved on. People North and South are now talking about what planning and preparation is necessary for the referendum to be held. Brexit shows the danger of holding a referendum without doing the planning and preparation in the first place. \n An Ceann Comhairle  Thank you, Deputy. I call Deputy Lawless. \n Deputy Peadar Tóibín  This morning the BBC mentioned that the Irish Government is the only place where this planning and preparation could happen. \n An Ceann Comhairle  Deputy Lawless. \n Deputy Peadar Tóibín  When will the Taoiseach step up to the plate? \n Deputy Paul Lawless  I want to raise concerns about the Supreme Court ruling in Britain on religious education and collective worship in the North of Ireland. Aontú is a pluralist republican party. I believe it is really important that all parents can choose the ethos of the school they wish to send their children to. Catholic schools played a significant role in the lives of nationalist families. They were a safe place for Catholics in the North and promoted the Irish language and games. \n An Ceann Comhairle  Thank you, Deputy. \n Deputy Paul Lawless  Will the Taoiseach engage with his counterpart----- \n An Ceann Comhairle  Thank you. \n Deputy Paul Lawless  -----in Britain to ensure we can retain our Catholic schools in the North? Schools can be an inclusive----- \n An Ceann Comhairle  Thank you, Deputy. Your time is up. If you want a response----- \n Deputy Paul Lawless  -----place and a religious place. \n An Ceann Comhairle  I call the Taoiseach, who has limited time I am afraid. \n The Taoiseach  I thank all of the Deputies for raising important issues. Deputy McGreehan in the first instance correctly identified that we are delivering results in respect of the shared island unit. It is practical and impactful. It is not about rhetoric. We have had rhetoric for 60 or 70 years and longer. It is about getting things done and delivering, and that is what we are doing. I take the point the Deputy made in respect of Dundalk IT and Queen's University. That is a very exciting development. It is a huge opportunity. Both institutions have to work now, as Deputy Ó Murchú said, to get the heads of agreement worked out and proper understanding for the benefit of students and staff. Deputy McGreehan has been a strong advocate of this. Deputy Ó Murchú has raised it as well. I have made it clear to the Minister, Deputy James Lawless, that I am supportive. I have no doubt that if the shared island unit gets a concrete proposal, it can respond positively. Obviously there is a lot more detailed work to be done. We need to do this properly, which is why the fund goes out to 2035. We do not need to rush things. We need to get them done properly and effectively so it is informed.  Deputy Devlin used the phrase \"practical people-focused projects\". This sums it up. No other Government since the foundation of the State has invested in Northern Ireland like this Government has. The shared island unit is a unique departure. It speaks far more than a lot of the rhetoric. I have been reading a lot about the 1940s, the 1950s and the 1960s. Some pretty good histories have been published recently on partition. Some good work has been done on all of this. Throughout the decades people spoke about four green fields, unity and all the rest of it but very little happened. We have come through 30 years of horrific violence, which was unnecessary in my view. We have an opportunity now. People are entitled to their constitutional positions. There is no issue there. There is nothing stopping any political party, by the way, from advancing a detailed blueprint. I have yet to see one. There is nothing stopping any political party doing this but we can come back to it on another day. \n Deputy Peadar Tóibín  The Government is the best place to do it. \n The Taoiseach  These questions are on the shared island unit so I will keep it there.  Deputy Devlin raised Dundalk IT and Queen's University and I have explained this. With regard to Dublin and Belfast and the night-time economies, we are very anxious to really develop the Dublin-Belfast economic corridor. The councils are good. I get the point on the night-time economies. I will look at it in terms of what we can do.  To respond to Deputy Paul Murphy, COP is a bit outside the shared island unit but he got it in. When he speaks about \"the big dairy farmers\" - he is classic at this - he is pretending that medium-sized and small dairy farmers would be okay under him. What he is saying would wipe out dairy farming entirely. This is what he is saying and he should be honest about it. The Government has made its position clear on this.  I agree 100% with Deputy Michael Murphy that we need evidence-based, informed and objective research and data. The shared island unit has a separate strand for big funding where we commission the ESRI to do major research. It did one on school completion North and South. The North was higher. We now have an initiative under the shared island unit on healthcare. \n An Ceann Comhairle  Thank you, Taoiseach. \n The Taoiseach  It has done economic studies as well as studies on primary care and health. Very good studies are being done by the ESRI and there will be more. More data will be coming next month. Research is also being done by the National Economic and Social Council.  To respond to Deputy Quaide, we are doing work in the area he mentioned but there is potential for more work if we can get a viable project. He is correct that attacks have increased. People are living in fear and this is a big concern.  To respond to Deputy Shane Moynihan, work has been done under the shared island unit in terms of enterprise centres and on SMEs. Deputy Moynihan can look at InterTradeIreland's project under the shared island unit, which I launched recently. Tremendous work has been done joining companies North and South together using shared island unit funding.  To respond to Deputy Conway-Walsh, there is commissioned research from the ESRI on economics. The shared island unit is outside of the constitutional issue and will remain so to try to get buy-in from all communities without prejudice. This is one of the reasons it has buy-in across the board from all communities and traditions. \n Deputy Rose Conway-Walsh  I am trying to avoid reinventing the wheel. \n The Taoiseach  Yes, but we do not want to undermine and kill what is a good initiative. \n Deputy Rose Conway-Walsh  It is not----- \n An Ceann Comhairle  We are out of time. \n The Taoiseach  Deputy Boyd Barrett raised what is a separate issue really. I would disagree with Deputy----- \n Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett  It is not a separate issue. People in the North are being arrested. \n The Taoiseach  I cannot account for the British----- \n An Ceann Comhairle  Thank you, Taoiseach, we are out of time. That concludes Questions to the Taoiseach. \n The Taoiseach  I will come back to Deputy Boyd Barrett another day on that. ",

        "answerText": " The Taoiseach  I propose to take Questions Nos. 1 to 14, inclusive, together.  The Cabinet committee on infrastructure last met on Thursday, 17 July and is scheduled to next meet on 3 November. The Cabinet committee works to drive infrastructure delivery and the implementation of the revised national development plan. We are prioritising the delivery of critical, growth-enhancing infrastructure, as outlined in the programme for Government. We have a responsibility to invest in the future and delivery of modern, sustainable and resilient infrastructure is vital for our national competitiveness, fostering regional development, delivering housing and meeting social needs.  The recently published review of the national development plan sets out the largest capital investment in the history of the State to unlock housing, upgrade water and energy infrastructure, deliver more roads and provide better public transport. In budget 2026 we announced €19.1 billion in Exchequer capital investment, an increase of €2 billion on 2025. This represents the highest annual spend to date in this country. Reform of delivery is also key to our approach. The new dedicated infrastructure division in the Department of Public Expenditure, Infrastructure, Public Service Reform and Digitalisation recently published its report outlining the most impactful barriers to infrastructure development, based on extensive consultation. This report has put significant detail behind what we already knew, that delivery of much needed infrastructure is taking too long.  Our regulatory and consent systems have evolved over time to the point where we have a complex landscape, characterised by an increasing number of decisions being referred to the courts for interpretation. All too frequently, this is leading to processes that take too long and an extremely conservative system. Next month, a detailed action plan to begin to tackle these barriers will be published. It will have a focused set of reforms that are practical, time-bound, and impactful. We will be taking action to strike a better balance between the rights of individuals and the public good. We will be simplifying regulation and consenting systems, reducing the administrative burden and cutting the red tape so that our systems are not delaying much-needed investment. The Government has now committed more than €275 billion to investment in infrastructure over the coming decade and the Cabinet committee will oversee the investment and the reforms required to maximise the efficiency with which it is delivered. \n Deputy Peter 'Chap' Cleere  I will speak about the construction of two brand-new multi-storey school buildings for the new post-primary schools, Kilkenny City Vocational School and Coláiste Pobail Osraí. These two schools have to be priority projects. Due to increasing numbers, the situation in these schools is unsustainable. They are currently under pressure to provide for existing and future student needs. The next phase of this project will be to release the funding and appoint the contractor. I hope - please God - that in a short time we will be turning the sod, which will make it real for people on the ground.  I acknowledge that €6 billion has been invested in schools nationally in the past five years and I welcome the July announcement of a further €7.5 billion for the Department of Education and Youth under the national development plan. However, this is a new chapter for both these schools We are looking forward to their development and to welcoming students into new buildings in the not-too-distant future. \n An Ceann Comhairle  Thank you, Deputy. \n Deputy Peter 'Chap' Cleere  We are counting on the Taoiseach's support to get these projects over the line as quickly as possible. \n Deputy Shane Moynihan  I welcome the urgency in the Taoiseach's reply on the need for us to build critical infrastructure to secure the growth of the country. As we seek to build more complex public infrastructure, such as public transport systems like the Luas for Lucan or primary care centres, in rapidly growing communities such as, in my constituency, Saggart, Rathcoole and parts of Citywest, it is important we ensure the international expertise we need to attract to the country to build that infrastructure is not put off by the long planing processes we have in place. If we are not attractive to those international companies and expertise, it will have the knock-on effect of increasing the cost of these projects in the future. We have to be aware of that and keep it to the front of our minds.  I also associate myself with the need for school buildings as a central part of infrastructure. I have raised a number of buildings in my constituency where we need to see progress with the Taoiseach and the Minister for education. Some are more than 40 years old and are in no condition for use at the moment. \n An Ceann Comhairle  Thank you, Deputy. \n Deputy Shane Moynihan  I encourage the Government to prioritise them as a matter of urgency. \n Deputy Séamus McGrath  I thank the Taoiseach for his reply. He mentioned the importance of investing in the future. Critical to that is investment in our city centres. Will he give an update on the task force for Cork city?  The programme for Government states that the model applied to the Dublin city task force will also be applied to Cork and will happen shortly. I hope this task force will deal with such strategic issues as improved transportation connectivity to Cork city, addressing issues around dereliction, vacancy and under-utilisation of buildings, investment in our public realm or streetscape, making the city a more attractive place to be and, critically from a day-to-day point of view, safety in our city centre and improved visibility of gardaí. I commend Cork City Council and Cork Business Association on their initiative of introducing wardens to the city centre recently. It was welcome. I hope the Taoiseach will give an update on when the Cork city task force will move on. \n Deputy Ruairí Ó Murchú  We have to see delivery of the catchment flood risk assessment and management, CFRAM, programme on flood protections, even in the short term. In estates like the one I am from, Bay Estate, there are issues with people trying to get flood insurance. Some who have bought houses recently are looking for letters of comfort which people used to get from the local authority, but are no longer available. The letters are to state the area has not been flooded. That issue needs to be dealt with in relation to the local authorities and insurance companies. However, beyond that we need to see delivery of CFRAM. That part of Dundalk is seriously suffering from the fact it does not have the requisite wastewater infrastructure. When we see heavy rains in my estate, we are incredibly worried about what will happen.  I am still waiting for a follow-up meeting with Uisce Éireann. I hope that will happen in the near future. However, we also need to ensure resourcing and finances are made available. \n Deputy Darren O'Rourke  I raise a number of important issues, including school buildings for Coláiste Ríoga in Dunshaughlin and Dunshaughlin Community National School, which have been waiting for a long time, despite having planning permission as far back as 2020. However, I will focus on the creaking wastewater treatment infrastructure. There have been numerous reports by the Environmental Protection Agency, EPA, and others on the need for investment in this infrastructure. It is welcome that there is a commitment to investment. How will projects be prioritised? I am particularly interested in the need for investment in the Kells wastewater treatment plant and in it happening as quickly as possible. \n Deputy Ruth Coppinger  A document was produced by Fingal County Council which identifies land banks, including one in Dublin 15 which could accommodate 20,000 homes.  Today, I received a reply from Fingal County Council. It has 105 families with termination notices or notices of eviction in Dublin 15 alone. I am coming to the Taoiseach as a TD from that area reporting a humanitarian crisis. I want to highlight some of the cases that our councillors are dealing with due to these notices of termination. One person has a child with cerebral palsy. Another person is in homeless accommodation with children who have no space to move and no area to play. Another person is in homeless accommodation and has to cross the M50 every single day. Another person has a child in an autism unit and, as the Taoiseach knows, it is very hard to get an alternative place if they lose their home. Another woman is still breastfeeding after having her newborn. There are many others with disabilities, autism and neurodiversity. When will we address the fact that instead of throwing money at developers, that money could have been given to councils to develop land banks like this, build real affordable homes and social homes, and end this humanitarian disaster? \n Deputy Paul Murphy  I want to ask about transport infrastructure, of which buses are the easiest, quickest and cheapest part to deploy. Every day, pretty much, I get emails about the state of the bus services in Ballycullen, Knocklyon and Rathfarnham. The 15 bus service is the busiest route in Dublin and the 15B is also grossly overcrowded. What is happening is that buses routinely fill up in the morning after the first few stops and then leave everyone behind at the later stops. This is a daily occurrence. One constituent says:  I now leave home at 7.15 a.m. to get to work for 9 a.m. My home is exactly 5 miles from the GPO. Who is accountable for privatising the buses? I do not remember getting to vote on it. I'm going to lose my job if this goes on.  A student says:  Something needs to be done quickly. I am increasingly desperate, anxious that I will miss something like an exam or something far more important than just a lecture in the near future.  For years, we have been promised that BusConnects is the answer but the A-spine is now delayed until the autumn of 2026 at the earliest, and it will likely be over capacity as soon as it starts. What is the Government planning to do to fix the bus service? \n Deputy Liam Quaide  Our two historic coastal towns in Cork East, Youghal and Cobh, are held back from realising their full potential by the absence of key infrastructural links. For Cobh, it is the lack of a second road access point to the Great Island. For Youghal, it is the failure to restore its rail connection with Midleton and, hence, its isolation from the eventual light rail system in the city. There are real and far-reaching impacts for residents of those towns as a result. They include safety on our congested roads and reduced potential for residential and economic development. In the case of Youghal, the daily quality of life impact of not having rail is grinding and immense. When will the Government show the infrastructural ambition that is needed in east Cork to allow Cobh and Youghal to reach their full, majestic potential? \n Deputy Peadar Tóibín  Storm Babet hit Cork two years ago. It caused damage estimated at about €200 million. It hammered the area, and it is very lucky that nobody was killed. Since then, practically nothing has been done. The area has been promised flood defences for decades but, in the best-case scenario, it is going to take eight years for those flood defences to come into play.  Navan is the largest town in the country without a rail line. More Meath people commute than in any other county and we commute further. Return journey times are about four hours at the moment. The former TD, Noel Dempsey, promised the rail line in 1994 but the best-case scenario is that it will be 2036 before it is built.  The Taoiseach said that the planning process has evolved. The planning process has not evolved. The Government created the planning process. We have the longest planning in Europe. We have the longest licensing and permits system in Europe. We have the longest tendering time in Europe at the moment. It is incredible. The whole system is falling apart. When will the Government reform it to make sure we can build infrastructure properly and on time in this country? \n Deputy Pádraig O'Sullivan  I raised an issue with the Taoiseach three weeks ago regarding the elective hospital in Cork. To be fair, the Taoiseach gave a good response and said it was a political decision that was made on the timing of the hospital, not a HSE decision. As I told the Taoiseach, the hospital was initially meant to take patients in 2027, but it is now looking like 2030 because the project will go from being a one-phase project to a multi-phase project. To be fair, the Taoiseach was quite forceful a number of weeks ago when he gave me his response. However, since that response, nothing has changed. I do not expect things to happen that quickly, to be fair, but the mood music is the same, unfortunately.  I would also reference capital projects in education, whether for ASD classes that were promised last year, extensions to buildings or new-build capital projects. The experience that I am hearing of in the House today is also being experienced by me, particularly in regard to the larger projects.  We talk about delivery here, and the Taoiseach has consistently talked about it since he was elected Taoiseach on the first occasion. Unfortunately, I am just seeing stalling, whether because of bureaucracy in the planning process, cost or issues with implementation. We need to ensure that the delivery is going to happen. \n Deputy Barry Heneghan  It is no surprise that I am bringing up the issue of private wires again. This is something that is going to reduce energy costs and speed up housing supply. It is a win-win for the Irish people. It will bypass bottlenecks in grid connections. I have recently been contacted by people who have solar farms that are waiting 18 to 24 months for connection. It will help businesses with large roof spaces to allow the loads and reduce their carbon footprints. It will also reduce the grid connection. It will enable large batteries for long-term energy storage to be more easily built out for our grid. With our offshore renewable energy, ORE, development, we are going to have huge curtailment. Electrolysis factories can easily be built for green hydrogen with private wires legislation. I urge that my Bill with the OPLA gets pushed through as fast as possible. It is going to benefit the Irish people. \n The Taoiseach  I thank the Deputies for raising these issues. I appreciate the focus from Deputy Cleere on Kilkenny City Vocational School and Coláite Pobail Osraí. I visited these schools many years ago with the late Bobby Aylward. I think his son was working there. I will certainly keep an eye on those and will talk to the Minister for education in respect of them. It is important. Substantial funding has been made available for education on the capital front. If we look at capital, we keep saying that delivery is not happening, and I did say that myself. At the same time, we are now spending the capital that has been allocated over the past two years. In 2020, 2021 and 2022, not all of the capital was spent and it was moved to other Departments to get spent. I refer to the past two to three years. This year, it is €2 billion-plus. We are at €19 billion, so we would have spent €17 billion last year. Inflation has happened and construction inflation has been higher than normal inflation, which has been a problem. The issue of European directives and European frameworks on the environmental side is proving very problematic in terms of flood relief programmes and so on, and there is no point in saying otherwise. I will pursue those.  Deputy Shane Moynihan reflected the idea that if we do not accelerate, we could lose international experience, which we are certainly seeking in respect of the metro and some of the more complex transport projects, such as light rail and so on. We have seen how that has worked in the past in terms of the Luas and other big developments. There are a lot of roadshows going on in terms of the implementation of the planning Act, the commencement of all regulations there, further legislation in respect of judicial review, which the Minister for justice is going to bring in, and the report coming back from the Minister, Deputy Chambers, in respect of removing the barriers and having a programme for the accelerated delivery of infrastructure projects. I know there are a number of school projects in the Deputy’s constituency that he has highlighted.  Deputy Seamus McGrath highlighted the need for investment in city centres. We significantly improved the living city initiative in the budget, which I advocated very strongly for. A lot will depend on the city council getting the maps back as quickly as possible for designation. With regard to shops, there will not be any timeline in respect of the date of the building, so any shop can convert and avail of the scheme. In terms of housing and other buildings, the year is now 1975 as opposed to 1915, so, hopefully, that will create some activity in the five cities and regional centres like Dundalk, Drogheda and other areas.  I have had meetings with the city council. People do not like the word “taskforce” in Cork - we are kind of fussy - so they are looking for a different title because the city has made progress. They had issues with that but, in any case, we are going to set up a group in terms of the roadmap for progress and a fresh approach to Cork city itself. It is important that we get the terms of reference and the focus right. Some work has been undertaken between UCC, the city council, the Cork Business Association and others in respect of how the city should progress. We want to make sure that in what we establish, we capture that and not duplicate or do something on a different strand or track.  The current development plan, up to 2028, is important. We are talking about a world class city driving local and regional growth and embracing diversity and inclusiveness. We have the large-scale regeneration projects in Cork docklands and Tivoli and the development of a much-enhanced, citywide public transport system. A lot of active travel projects have been delivered in Cork city. which is quite good to see. It is about bringing all of that together. I would be particularly interested in the inner city core - that we create new opportunities there. There is more work to be done for towns around the country in that respect. We need to bring more residential back in. This then creates new opportunities for a different kind of retail and hospitality into the future.  Deputy Ó Murchú referenced flood projection and CFRAM. I could not agree with the Deputy more. All the flood relief schemes are slow-moving, by definition, in terms of consultation with various groups, stakeholders and so forth. It is something I have raised with the Attorney General and others in terms of EU frameworks that govern a lot of this. Adaptation and flood relief are critical to the survival of towns and cities. They are urgent because of the impact of climate change, which is very real. \n Deputy Peadar Tóibín  Our averages are higher. \n The Taoiseach  Where we have implemented flood relief schemes, for example, Bandon, which I would be aware of, Fermoy and Clonmel, the impacts have been very significant in protecting those towns. The public good has to take precedence.  Deputy McGreehan raised the growth in population and the issue around wastewater treatment and so forth. Deputy O'Rourke raised the topic of school buildings, including a number in his area, creaking water infrastructure and the Kells wastewater treatment plant. We will be engaging with Irish Water given the additional it has now received.  Deputy Coppinger mentioned Fingal County Council. She said there are 20,000 homes. That is a matter for the council to get going. There is about €11 billion of public expenditure allocated to housing this year between capital, current and Exchequer funding. That is a lot of funding from the State side. We are not throwing money at developers. We are putting a lot of money into housing. We are putting a lot of money into social housing. \n Deputy Ruth Coppinger  They do not have the money for that, though. \n The Taoiseach  We need the private sector as well, in addition to the huge unprecedented public sector investment.  Deputy Paul Murphy raised public transport and the state of the bus services. A lot of investment has gone into the bus services. BusConnects has been slower because there has been huge consultation with people, residents and communities who had issues with BusConnects - let us be honest - and those were legitimate issues. We will continue to prioritise public services. It is not a privatised bus service. There is a substantial Bus Éireann contribution to public buses. Bus Éireann and Iarnród Éireann have expanded.  In reply to Deputy Quaide, there is work under way in respect of the alternative route into Cobh. There is the issue of the rail connection to the Youghal greenway. That is being developed but I get the issue. Cork to Midleton was the first railway expansion in its time and it reversed a trend lasting 50 or 60 years. It has been extremely effective. However, we need to continue to work on the economy within Youghal and create opportunities for people living in the town. It is an iconic and attractive area. That is something we have to continue to work on. We are very focused on the need to get that road situation into Cobh sorted. There are economic implications arising from that, in terms of releasing the docklands, the port, marina point and so on.  Deputy Tóibín raised Storm Babet. I dealt with some aspects of that in terms of the flood defence issues. The county council has worked on certain households and businesses and protecting them as interim steps, but, again, that is a complex scheme. It has numerous challenges and Midleton has numerous challenges in terms of potential flooding risks. That is understood. There is a lot of work going on to try to get that scheme going.  Deputy O'Sullivan raised the elective hospital. I put that back on the map at the time. I am going to pursue this. We have the site, and likewise in Galway. There has been a lot of school expansions in Cork as well. We will continue to focus to get more of those done, and more quickly. There are quite a number on the list that we need to get done. Now, with the allocation that has been given to education, we will certainly keep the pressure on to complete the projects. The Minister of State, Deputy Moynihan, is working particularly on the special education side to get special classes provided and get extensions done to accommodate extra autism classes.  Deputy Heneghen raised private wires. The Minister has got sanction from Cabinet and is progressing with the legislation. This is important because it will help some companies that are waiting for connection and so on. ",

        "answerText": " The Taoiseach  I propose to take Questions Nos. 13 to 24, inclusive, together.  The programme for Government 2025, Securing Ireland's Future, recognises the importance of Cabinet committees to the policy development and oversight work of Government.  The Cabinet committee on EU and international affairs was established by the Government on 18 February 2025. Its role is to oversee implementation of programme for Government commitments in relation to the European Union, including preparation of Ireland's Presidency in the second half of 2026, and international issues.  The Cabinet committee last met on Monday, 16 June when it considered items on the agenda of the meeting of the European Council that took place on 26 June, the situation in the Middle East and the EU's future budget for the period beyond 2027.  As I reported to the House in my statement on 9 July, at its June meeting, the European Council discussed developments in Ukraine; the Middle East, including the humanitarian situation in Gaza; European defence and security; global economic developments; competitiveness; migration; preparedness; and the EU's internal security.  Leaders also exchanged views on EU-US trade relations. The next meeting of the Cabinet committee is scheduled for 16 October when it will discuss items on the agenda of the European Council meeting that will take place on 23 and 24 October. It will also take stock of ongoing preparations for Ireland's Presidency of the EU Council in the second half of 2026. \n Deputy Malcolm Byrne  We are seeing an expanding war in Europe now and Russia’s campaign of aggression against Ukraine but also others. We are seeing horrific things. Up to an estimated 20,000 children have now been abducted from Ukraine and taken into Russian territory. We also know about the hybrid and cyber attacks from Russia on member states of the European Union and, indeed, other European countries. We have seen drone attacks and violations of airspace in recent months on Poland, Finland, Denmark, Sweden, Norway, Romania, Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania. Those counties know that combat aircraft have had to be scrambled. We know Russian vessels are in Irish waters yet, while I have sought it since we resumed after the summer, we have not had a debate in this House around the escalating war in Europe. I welcome from Pat Leahy’s insightful reporting in The Irish Times yesterday about Ireland preparing for potential drone attacks during the EU Presidency.  We need assurances. When every other parliament in Europe is debating the fact that there is an increased risk of war, we are not debating it in this House. \n Deputy Shane Moynihan  Before the summer, I raised with the Taoiseach the ongoing humanitarian catastrophe that is happening in Sudan, the fact that over 150,000 people have been killed and almost 14 million people have been displaced. Ironically, of all the conflicts in the world at the moment, the conflict in Sudan seems to be the one that has the most unanimity among European Union members. Therefore, I would call on the Taoiseach, while welcoming the recent renewal of the sanctions against members of the RSF regime in Sudan at the Council meeting in September, to say what we will be doing to further advocate for the people of Sudan and surrounding countries on the need to bring that conflict to an end, working with the African Union to assert its leadership role in the region and to ensure, in a conflict where the European Union has a united voice, that we can avoid the devastation of the thousands of people being killed and the millions being displaced and the fact that once vibrant cities such as Khartoum are now burnt out shells. \n Deputy Shay Brennan  In recent weeks, we have seen an increase in Russian drone incursions into airspace of several EU member states. These were accompanied by threats to energy and transport infrastructure. Both the European Parliament and the Council have called for a stronger, more co-ordinated EU response including potential joint air defence measures, tougher sanctions and new protocols to address aerial and hybrid threats. Could the Taoiseach outline Ireland's position in these ongoing EU discussions? Specifically, is Ireland advocating for a common European air defence framework for greater intelligence sharing and protection of critical infrastructure or for stronger co-ordinated sanctions? Finally, how does the Government assess our own capacity to respond to hybrid attacks and what forms of EU solidarity or support does it consider most vital in this context? \n Deputy Naoise Ó Cearúil  Like most of us, I welcome the peace deal between Palestine and Israel. I remain hopeful that we will see positive outcomes from the negotiations.  I commend the Taoiseach, the Tánaiste, our MEPs and, indeed, our diplomatic corps who have worked tirelessly to share our mission and how we believe what was occurring in Palestine was genocide.  I am shocked that I am the first person today to raise this. No leaders of the Opposition raised this during Leaders' Questions. Indeed, today, during Taoiseach's questions, I am the first one to raise it.  I ask what the Taoiseach's comment on it is and, indeed, in relation to the aid provided in support to UNRWA, if he has any information on when that will get through to the Palestinian people. \n Deputy Ruth Coppinger  I, indeed, will be raising it too. \n Deputy Naoise Ó Cearúil  Brilliant. \n Deputy Ruth Coppinger  The Deputy just happened to be the first person.  In relation to Palestine and the ceasefire, I want to ask the Taoiseach, \"What now?\" What should be the approach of the Government in relation to what has happened?  Obviously, any respite for the people of Gaza and for the children of Gaza from the genocide that they have endured for almost two years is hugely welcome. However, of the people who are in charge of this peace deal, Netanyahu was a war criminal last week. He is a war criminal this week. Donald Trump has funded a genocide for 20 months. There was a ceasefire when Donald Trump came to power. These are the people who are congratulating themselves for ending a genocide that they are responsible for.  Do Palestinian lives matter? Should Palestinian people have a say? I want to ask the Taoiseach about a post he put up on Twitter yesterday. The Taoiseach welcomed the release of the Israeli hostages, as we all do, but he made absolutely no mention of the Palestinian hostages who were released - people who were seen emaciated talking about torture beyond belief. Many of them found out that their families are dead. Some of them are children. An autistic boy was released from captivity yesterday and there are lots of other children still in prison. A lot of people found the Taoiseach's approach quite unbelievable - not one mention. For a state that is meant to support the Palestinian State and the Palestinian people, the Taoiseach only referred to the Israeli hostages, not the thousands of Palestinian hostages. It was quite unbelievable. It speaks to me of an approach that is going to happen where we will all move on now and pretend that Netanyahu was not a war criminal, pretend that Donald Trump is a hero and that the Palestinian people will have no say in their own fate going forward on this peace deal. I wonder what the Taoiseach has to say about that. A lot of people commented on it last night. The Taoiseach still has not put anything else up either. \n Deputy Paul Murphy  I welcome the ceasefire. Any relief for the Palestinian people facing genocide is obviously welcome. I emphasise that a lasting peace will only be built on the basis of justice and there is still definitely no justice for the Palestinian people. My question relates to Government policy in this context.  I am concerned that the various commitments that have been given in the context of pressure of a massive solidarity movement and massive public support for the Palestinian people will now be forgotten or kicked down the road never to happen. First, in relation to the occupied territories Bill, will the Taoiseach give a commitment that it will be passed and implemented before Christmas and will it include trade in goods and services, as the Fine Gael candidate for President has now apparently said she is in favour of?  Second, in relation to the investigation about the overflights, there is an examination ongoing for more than a year of something that is very simple. Is this just going to simply continue and disappear or are we ever going to get to the bottom of that and action to stop it?  Third, I have heard the Taoiseach previously say that no airplanes with military cargo, weapons or soldiers are landing in Shannon Airport on the way to Israel. The Ditch has a story saying that on Sunday Simon Harris authorised a US military plane to refuel at Shannon Airport on its way from a US Department of War air base to the Nevatim Israel Defense Forces base. It was transporting soldiers or military cargo and it stopped over at Shannon Airport. That seems to me to be completely wrong. Was the Taoiseach aware of this? Does the Taoiseach agree with granting authorisation for our airport to be used in that way? \n Deputy Rose Conway-Walsh  Obviously we all welcome the ceasefire and we wait with bated breath but what is important is what is within our capacity here and the commitments that have already been made. My question to the Taoiseach is on the occupied territories Bill. Is the occupied territories Bill going to be implemented in this term of the Dáil, will that include goods and services, and can the Taoiseach comment, as the previous speaker said, on the authorisation by the Tánaiste of the plane that landed to refuel on its way to Israel over the weekend? \n The Taoiseach  I thank all the Deputies who have raised a variety of questions. Deputy Malcolm Byrne raised an important issue in terms of Russia's aggression against Europe. I attended an event in the United Nations, chaired by Prime Minister Carney and President Zelensky and their respective spouses, in respect of the 20,000 abducted children. Ireland will continue to provide support. I would like to be in a position to support certain research in respect of those children to get them back. It is an appalling crime.  The Deputy referenced the violation of airspace in Estonia, Romania, Poland and other countries, and, most recently, Denmark. This is where all European leaders were gathering at an informal gathering and the European Political Community was gathering. As was said at that meeting, there was one accident, two accidents, but there is a pattern. There is a pattern of behaviour from the Russian Government and President Putin over the last year and a half or more, which is aggressive and poses a risk to European security and defence, particularly vital sub-sea critical infrastructure, and many of our utilities through cyberattacks and hybrid attacks - drones or other type of attacks. The Baltic states, Poland and others have experienced these on their territory. It is very serious. There is no sense in this House at all about how grave the situation is. At best, you could say it is reckless.  It is also happening in the United Kingdom. These hybrid-type attacks are reckless. We need a debate in the Dáil to increase the level of awareness in the House of what actually is happening and what Russia is up to. I repeat that critical subsea infrastructure is at risk from these types of activities. Our utilities are at risk. We had the HSE attack some years ago. We have to improve capability. Deputy Shay Brennan added to this. I will come back to Deputy Shane Moynihan's earlier point.  I believe we have to co-ordinate with fellow member states in Europe to protect against these cyberattacks and to share knowledge and information on where some of the shadow fleet is loitering and where the shadow fleet is turning up. We have to work with like-minded member states in order to make sure that we know what is going on, that others know what is going on and that it is co-ordinated. We will continue to co-ordinate and to work with others to gain knowledge.  Cyberattacks cannot be defended against without working with others. It is about sharing knowledge, expertise and information. This is why we have an individually tailored plan with NATO in terms of the issue of cybersecurity, subsea cables, knowledge, expertise, mentoring and training. It is needed. We need to get over any squeamishness about this in the world we live in today. If people do not believe this stuff, their heads are in the sand in terms of the threats that are out there now. Deputies Malcolm Byrne and Shay Brennan have outlined them in no uncertain terms. This is what I have to say right now. We are taking all of it very seriously. We had a discussion on energy security earlier and there is no question that ships have been loitering. Russia is gathering information all of the time in respect of the critical economic infrastructure that everyone in Europe depends on and the world depends on.  Deputy Shane Moynihan raised the issue of Sudan. He is one of the few Deputies who has raised it. Sudan is the worst humanitarian crisis in the world. I spoke with the UN Secretary General, António Guterres, about Sudan. What is very disquieting about Sudan is the behaviour of other countries in the region, which are supporting one side or the other and using both sides as proxies in this war. These are countries that would have a different perspective on Gaza. The two do not match that easily. There is an inconsistency in approach, to say the least. Millions are starving and up to 12 million or 15 million people have been displaced in Sudan. South Sudan is in a challenging position as well. We constantly raise it at European Union forums and at the UN to see what can be done to bring this to a resolution.  On Gaza, Deputy Ó Cearúil is correct. I would pay tribute to President Trump for getting a ceasefire. It should have happened earlier. I thank the Deputy for paying tribute to our diplomatic corps. People wanted us to break diplomatic relations and call back our ambassadors from Israel and other places. Our ambassador in Israel has worked hard under a lot of pressure to represent Ireland and Irish citizens well in Gaza, on the flotilla or wherever. Our ambassador in Israel has been to the fore in providing consular services and doing her best to make sure our people do not come to any harm. Our ambassador in Cairo has been superb throughout this entire period in facilitating people to leave Gaza. Our ambassadors in Jordan and the UAE have all worked together. Do not ever underestimate the importance of diplomatic relationships in terms of doing the basic necessities and being there to keep the channels of communication open. I am glad we did not break off diplomatic relations for this reason, among others.  I also pay tribute to the medics in Gaza. Deputy Martin Daly, who is a doctor, has raised this with me. He suggested to me in writing that they should get the Nobel Peace Prize for what they have done in the most extraordinary of circumstances, under huge threat to their lives. Many did die. The work they did is quite exceptional and should be recalled or acknowledged. \n An Leas-Cheann Comhairle  We are over time now, Taoiseach. \n The Taoiseach  Deputy Coppinger has a tendency to distort. There is nothing wrong with saying that young music followers who were abducted for no reason at all----- \n Deputy Ruth Coppinger  I did not say there was anything wrong with----- \n The Taoiseach  I just want to make the point. Everything gets qualified and has a caveat. I make no apology for saying it is a good day that those hostages were released. \n Deputy Ruth Coppinger  It is about not saying anything about Palestinian hostages, Taoiseach. That is the question. \n The Taoiseach  I did. I spoke about an end to the slaughter. \n Deputy Ruth Coppinger  No, that is not----- \n The Taoiseach  I have been saying this consistently. Check all of my remarks on social media. I am very strong on the genocide against civilians in Gaza and the slaughter of innocent children. Yes, there have been a lot of detainees without any trials or without any evidence. Others who were detained had history. Deputy Coppinger will never condemn Hamas for some reason. I have never heard her condemn Hamas in this room. I have never heard her condemn what Hamas did on 7 October. \n An Leas-Cheann Comhairle  I ask the Taoiseach to conclude. \n The Taoiseach  Deputy Murphy has never condemned Hamas. \n Deputy Paul Murphy  Can we get answers on the occupied territories Bill? \n The Taoiseach  That is shocking and it deserves debate. You are attacking me for not having precision in terms of posts I put up. \n Deputy Paul Murphy  No, we are asking questions. \n Deputy Ruth Coppinger  It is Taoiseach's questions. \n An Leas-Cheann Comhairle  We have now used the time for Taoiseach's questions. \n The Taoiseach  I find it extraordinary that we do not have unanimity in the House in terms of condemnation of Hamas's appalling attack on----- \n Deputy Ruth Coppinger  I think you did not want to say anything about the Palestinian hostages, Taoiseach. That is very clear. \n An Leas-Cheann Comhairle  I have to ask the Taoiseach to conclude. \n The Taoiseach  By the way, I have never moved on from Gaza and I do not intend to move on from Gaza. I visited Gaza in 2009 after that war. We have always been consistent as a country. The party I lead was the first party in Europe and in government to recognise the right of Palestinians to a homeland. It matters to our party. Let us not try to out-virtue each other here. \n Deputy Ruth Coppinger  So will you say something tonight about the Palestinians? \n The Taoiseach  We will say what we feel. \n An Leas-Cheann Comhairle  I must ask the Taoiseach to conclude. \n The Taoiseach  We will say it in the context of our informed perspective and our evidence-based approach to these issues.  To respond to Deputy Murphy on the occupied territories Bill, it is in committee. I have always repeatedly said in terms of services that we need to assess that. The Attorney General is coming back to us on a number of fronts - one is implementability, by the way. The feedback I am getting is it is not just  implementable but, second, are you putting companies based here in a very difficult position through no fault of their own in respect of how that would be treated in the United States? These are ongoing matters and we are waiting for reports back. I will have to talk to the Tánaiste in respect of one specific----- \n An Leas-Cheann Comhairle  Taoiseach, we have gone way over time. \n The Taoiseach  I apologise. \n An Leas-Cheann Comhairle  We have to move on to the next business. We cannot go into Questions Nos. 25 to 35, inclusive, because the time has lapsed. ",

As the Deputy will be aware, the Government decided to accept the recommendations of the Moore Street Advisory Group (MSAG) and instructed the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage (D/HLGH) and the Office of Public Works (OPW) to advance a project to conserve the National Monument at 14–17 Moore Street and to open it as a visitor site commemorating the events of Easter Week 1916.  In seeking to further develop the proposals approved by Government following the Moore St Advisory Group (MSAG) process, the D/HLGH and the OPW are considering options for the site to the rear of 14-17 Moore St. Currently, the focus is on the Ministerial Consent based on the Concept Design for the site at Moore Lane. The application for the Ministerial Consent for 14–17 has recently been lodged and is currently being considered.  Other than a specific two week period stipulated for consultation with the National Museum, there is no statutory period for a decision set out in the Act. For the purpose of programming however, OPW have assumed a decision period of eight weeks. At this stage it is not possible to provide definitive start and completion dates for the full programme of works prior to the approval of the Ministerial Consent applications. However, we expect meaningful on-site progress in 2026, subject to statutory and procurement processes.   Condition and protection of the historic fabric   Since 2018, the OPW has been responsible for the maintenance and care of the Moore Street buildings. Following the principle of conservation in situ, the focus has been on stabilising and protecting the existing historic fabric, with minimal intervention, until full restoration can take place. Earlier protective works, including re-roofing and weatherproofing, addressed moisture-related timber deterioration. The buildings have since undergone a sustained period of drying, and current moisture levels are stable, substantially reducing the risk of decay.  In 2024, OPW commissioned an expert survey of all historic timbers. Ongoing monitoring continues, and targeted mitigation measures are applied where needed. Further specialist assessments of at-risk timbers are underway, and depending on their condition, treatments may involve in-situ conservation or removal for off-site specialist treatment and reinstatement. The OPW directly oversees this programme to ensure the protection of the historic fabric until substantive works begin.   Project brief   In OPW in June 2022 the OPW finalised a Definitive Project Brief document setting out the requirements for the project at 14-17 Moore St. This comprised a narrative document and accompanying design drawings setting out the requirements.  The OPW, working closely with D/HLGH, continues to progress the Moore Street project in accordance with Government direction and statutory requirements.

As the Deputy will be aware, the Government decided to accept the recommendations of the Moore Street Advisory Group (MSAG) and instructed the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage (D/HLGH) and the Office of Public Works (OPW) to advance a project to conserve the National Monument at 14–17 Moore Street and to open it as a visitor site commemorating the events of Easter Week 1916.  In seeking to further develop the proposals approved by Government following the Moore St Advisory Group (MSAG) process, the D/HLGH and the OPW are considering options for the site to the rear of 14-17 Moore St. Currently, the focus is on the Ministerial Consent based on the Concept Design for the site at Moore Lane. The application for the Ministerial Consent for 14–17 has recently been lodged and is currently being considered.  Other than a specific two week period stipulated for consultation with the National Museum, there is no statutory period for a decision set out in the Act. For the purpose of programming however, OPW have assumed a decision period of eight weeks. At this stage it is not possible to provide definitive start and completion dates for the full programme of works prior to the approval of the Ministerial Consent applications. However, we expect meaningful on-site progress in 2026, subject to statutory and procurement processes.   Condition and protection of the historic fabric   Since 2018, the OPW has been responsible for the maintenance and care of the Moore Street buildings. Following the principle of conservation in situ, the focus has been on stabilising and protecting the existing historic fabric, with minimal intervention, until full restoration can take place. Earlier protective works, including re-roofing and weatherproofing, addressed moisture-related timber deterioration. The buildings have since undergone a sustained period of drying, and current moisture levels are stable, substantially reducing the risk of decay.  In 2024, OPW commissioned an expert survey of all historic timbers. Ongoing monitoring continues, and targeted mitigation measures are applied where needed. Further specialist assessments of at-risk timbers are underway, and depending on their condition, treatments may involve in-situ conservation or removal for off-site specialist treatment and reinstatement. The OPW directly oversees this programme to ensure the protection of the historic fabric until substantive works begin.

        "answerText": " The Taoiseach  I propose to take Questions Nos. 1 to 10, inclusive, together.  The Cabinet committee on health last met on 17 July and is due to meet again soon. The committee oversees implementation of programme for Government commitments in relation to health, receives detailed reports on identified policy areas and considers health reforms including Sláintecare, the reform of public health and health system preparedness for future health threats. It also receives reports in relation to programme for Government commitments in the areas of mental health and drugs policy. Sláintecare 2025+, our latest Sláintecare strategy published in May 2025, aims to forge the way forward towards accessible, affordable and high-quality healthcare for the people of Ireland when they need it and where they need it. We will deliver faster access to care. Funding of €420 million has been allocated for the waiting list action plan this year. The new regional structures within the HSE have been established, with six new health regions and 20 integrated healthcare areas. Health and social care services are planned and delivered around the specific needs of local populations, leading to better co-ordination of care and access to services. We will continue to review capacity in emergency departments, increase the number of public-only consultants in emergency medicine and ensure more senior staff are rostered in emergency departments during weekends and public holidays for better decision-making. We will continue to build our workforce through the recruitment of key roles, retention measures and additional college places for key disciplines. We will continue to invest in a healthier future, with a national physical activity framework and action plan due to be published in 2025 and a new obesity policy and action plan to be published in 2026. We are launching a new era of innovation and digital transformation in health. The national patient app has been rolled out. The national shared care record is being developed and the electronic health record will also be progressed. Additional projects which are key to the increased digitalisation of the health service include a national system for electronic prescribing and remote health monitoring and virtual care solutions.  In mental health, we will continue to build the mental health workforce and infrastructure and support community-based services. In older people’s services, we will support people to live at home within their own communities and strengthen the nursing home sector. The forthcoming national policy on adult safeguarding for the health and social care sector, a programme for Government commitment, will set out how existing protections will be strengthened. All of these commitments build on the investment and reforms undertaken over the past number of years, including the delivery of approximately 1,330 acute beds, an increased workforce of over 29,000 whole-time equivalents since December 2019, more affordable healthcare through a reduction in the drugs payment scheme threshold to €80, the removal of hospital inpatient charges, the extension of the eligibility for free GP cards for all children under eight and to all earning no more than the median income, State-funded IVF, free contraception for women aged 17 to 35 and free access to HRT. From September 2021 to the end of August 2025, there has been an almost 56% reduction in the number of patients waiting over 12 months. The surgical hub for south Dublin opened in February this year with additional hubs becoming operational in 2026. Care is being delivered closer to home in 180 primary care centres through 96 community health networks. Twenty-seven community specialist teams for older persons and 26 community specialist teams for chronic disease are now operational and 23 community intervention teams are operational, with national coverage secured. We will continue to invest and reform, changing the way our services are delivered this year and into the future \n Deputy Paul McAuliffe  The Taoiseach may be aware that there are four capital projects currently under way in Beaumont Hospital which are at different stages. They include a new emergency department, a new 95-bed ward block, a 64-bed critical care unit and an extension to radiation and oncology departments. Will the Taoiseach give an assurance to the House that these projects will be funded and will be done in a timely way? Despite the complexity of it being a live campus site with services being continued, can we be assured that sufficient supports will be put in place to allow these important extensions to a hospital which serves the north side of Dublin? \n Deputy Ivana Bacik  The Taoiseach outlined some of what the Government has been doing on health. In this budget forthcoming next week, will he clarify if there will be provision to increase the level of GP coverage around the country? I think all of us, in rural and urban areas alike, are hearing about the difficulty in accessing GP services, and about GPs who report being overworked and facing difficulties in establishing practices and in succession. GPs are retiring and are unable to recruit successors. What will be done in the budget for that? I also want to ask about the extension of free GP care to all those under 18. The Taoiseach referred to it in his opening remarks. The Labour Party in particular has been committed to ensuring that roll-out is continued and we are keen to see something in the budget for that. Finally, I return to the question of the inquiry which we welcome for children with scoliosis and spina bifida as a result of the meeting between the Tánaiste and the Minister for Health with the parents of Harvey Morrison Sherratt. I asked earlier for clarification on the publication of the relevant reports. We need a schedule for publication of the Nayagam report. It was commissioned two years ago but we still have not seen it published. \n Deputy Pádraig O'Sullivan  I raise the elective hospitals and surgical hubs that are being delivered across the country, with particular reference to the Cork situation. Initially, in response to parliamentary questions, we were told it was envisaged that patients would be seen by 2027, all going well. The language used in parliamentary questions of late is frustrating and now suggests patients might not be seen until 2030 in the elective hospitals around the country, including that in Cork. It is a commitment in the programme for Government. There is an envelope of €9.25 million under the national development plan up to 2030. We are disappointed that the language is now changing to say that patients will not be seen until the end of this decade. It is incredibly frustrating. There are waiting lists out your ears to get appointments for certain procedures in CUH. We have been told repeatedly that the elective hospital in Glanmire will be a gamechanger. We need to get it back on track to make sure we will not be waiting until 2030. \n Deputy Michael Cahill  There are former residential and reformatory school survivors on hunger strike outside the gates of Leinster House as we speak. I raised this matter last week with the Minister for justice in the Dáil. This is their tenth day on hunger strike. This very serious situation has reached an impasse, with the Minister for education having advised them that their demands cannot be met. The hunger strikers assure me they will see this out to a tragic conclusion if necessary. Is there nothing we can offer them to end this tragic event? After their years of suffering in the control of a State body, they have been left with nothing. Others in similar circumstances have received some compensation. Their demands include each being issued with a HAA card to access comprehensive healthcare and full contributory State pensions to compensate for the years of forced unpaid labour they provided to the State. \n Deputy David Cullinane  There is no family that is not impacted by mental health difficulties and challenges at some point. We know early intervention is key to preventing serious illness, particularly for young people if a mental illness is caught at a young age and the intervention services are available. Jigsaw is an important service as part of the overall supports for young people.  In Waterford, unfortunately, we do not have a Jigsaw service. Waterford is the largest city without that service. Deputy Conor D. McGuinness and I, as well as the Minister of State, Deputy Butler, have raised this issue. I am looking for an update on where that is at.  The second issue I raise is the need to deliver 24-7 cardiac services for the people of Waterford. The Minister committed to doing this, in principle at least. We have the second cath lab but, at this point in time, we do not know when the staff will be hired and what the timeline is. Will the Taoiseach outline when full 24-7 cardiac services will be in place in Waterford and the south east? \n Deputy Peadar Tóibín  I welcome the announcement that there will be an inquiry into the care of spina bifida and scoliosis patients by CHI. It is good news and I give credit to Stephen and Gillian and the advocacy groups for achieving this. It is really important that it be a statutory public inquiry. Any inquiry without the power to compel people or papers will not get to the truth in relation to this. It is also important that the terms of reference are in agreement with the family of Harvey Sherratt and the advocacy groups. We have been here before where terms of reference were promised to be done in agreement with the campaign and then, at the last minute, the group found the terms of reference were not in sympathy with its views. In the case of the Women of Honour, a number of women who were part of that campaign did not agree with the terms of reference. Mention was previously made of the establishment of an office of inquiry. Given that these statutory inquiries can go on at length----- \n An Ceann Comhairle  I call Deputy Emer Currie. \n Deputy Peadar Tóibín  -----it is important that we get to a situation where we have a permanent office of inquiry to make sure----- \n An Ceann Comhairle  Thank you, Deputy Tóibín. \n Deputy Peadar Tóibín  -----these inquiries can be delivered efficiently and speedily. \n Deputy Emer Currie  Approximately 10,000 people in Ireland develop shingles every year, two thirds of them over the age of 50. One in three of us who had chickenpox as children will develop shingles in our lifetime. The national immunisation advisory committee recommends five vaccines for older adults - flu, pneumococcal, Covid, shingles and RSV - yet only three are publicly funded. The shingles vaccine is available only to those who can pay for it, the cost being almost €500. This creates inequity, leaving many unprotected. Ireland is now an outlier, with 15 European countries, including the UK, France, Germany and Italy, already funding shingles vaccination for older and vulnerable people. Will the Taoiseach please consider adding shingles to the vaccination programme? \n Deputy Rose Conway-Walsh  I raise the serious issue of the shortage of beds in Beaumont Hospital. An example of the impact of this shortage is brought home by the very serious case of one of my constituents. I have his family's permission to raise his case with the Taoiseach because they are absolutely desperate. His name is Henry Keane from Blacksod and he was recently diagnosed with a brain tumour. Since 17 September, he has been waiting in Mayo University Hospital for a transfer to Beaumont Hospital. He is listed under a consultant in Beaumont who has accepted the transfer but Beaumont is waiting to have a bed available. There is no bed available. We can imagine what it is like to be lying in a hospital bed not knowing what the future holds, unable to get the treatment you need and not knowing when that treatment will be given. Every day, you wait and hope and, every day, nothing happens. There is no bed for you today. Is that the way we treat our most vulnerable people in 2025? \n An Ceann Comhairle  Before the Taoiseach responds----- \n Deputy Paul Murphy  May I come in on this group of questions, a Cheann Comhairle? \n An Ceann Comhairle  No, I have called nine Deputies. I will call Deputy Murphy on the next group of questions.  If the Taoiseach will allow me the liberty, I acknowledge that the Mexican ambassador, Her Excellency Carolina Zaragoza Flores, has joined us in the Gallery. The ambassador is retiring today. I take the opportunity to thank her for her sterling body of work. Her husband, José, is with her. I thank the ambassador for her kindness to me during her tenure and I wish her all the best in her retirement. \n The Taoiseach  I thank the ambassador for her work over the past number of years. We enjoyed our engagement with her and I really appreciate that.  Deputy McAuliffe raised the issue of Beaumont Hospital. There are four major projects under way there. The national development plan has allocated very substantial funding to the Department of Health and the HSE for the realisation of those projects. The key is to keep the pressure on to get them through the various stages. Health capital tends to be slow and health projects tend to be slow moving. We need to accelerate some of these projects and get them delivered. They are well under way in some respects, with planning going on and so on. I appreciate the point the Deputy made. Beaumont is a national centre for key disciplines and a very important centre.  Deputy Bacik raised the issue of access to and coverage of GP services. In terms of the budget, Estimates discussions are going on. I recall her colleague Senator McDowell saying the Government is being fiscally reckless. He thinks we are spending too much. On the other hand, Deputy Bacik and others will come along and say that we should spend more on health services. Expansion of eligibility and so on will have a cost attached to it. Public expenditure will grow significantly again this year but we have to watch the rate of growth, without question. That will limit what is possible within the health budget in the next couple of weeks and in the announcement in the budget itself. We are endeavouring to have a sustainable health budget along the lines of what we planned over the past two years, which has worked effectively enough in terms of outcomes and improvements and also in terms of fiscal sustainability for the health service. The increase in the budget has been exponential over the past number of years. In my reply, I went through all the various initiatives we have provided in terms of reducing costs for patients. Capacity is very important.  Regarding the inquiry we spoke about earlier into CHI and the publication of reports, I will talk to the Minister in respect of timelines. My understanding is that the Nayagam report will be ready before the end of the year. It needs to be published and it will be important in terms of feeding into any inquiry that will be established.  Deputies Cahill and O'Sullivan referred to the elective hospitals. I will pursue that issue. It is annoying in that going back to 2016 or 2017, there was a different Government planning a second hospital for Cork. We correctly looked at that when we came in after 2020 and we agreed on elective hospitals in Galway and Cork initially and in Dublin subsequently. Those projects have been progressing and are in planning, design and all of that, but they need to get a move on. We have a site in Galway and a site in Cork. The surgical hubs are moving as well. I have made it very clear to officials and to the HSE that these are commitments the Government has decided on and they need to be delivered and implemented. Sometimes, notwithstanding Government decisions, there can be elements in the system who think these things do not have to be delivered. It is my job to sort that out.  Deputy Cahill raised a very difficult and sad situation. I ask that we do everything we can to ask those people to come off hunger strike, which can be very damaging to people's health. There has been a long history of institutional abuse. There have been a lot of supports over the years for survivors of institutional abuse, going back even prior to the report of the Ryan commission being concluded. Redress happened for quite large numbers much in advance of any inquiries. Other initiatives were taken in terms of housing and so on. The Government will engage with the survivors but for their own health and well-being, it is important that they would come off the strike. I understand the Minister met with some of the survivors. I will follow up with her to see what can be done.  Deputy Tóibín spoke about the public inquiry into CHI. I used the words \"timely\" and \"effective\" and the Deputy made the point that he would prefer a permanent office of inquiry. He said inquiries can go on, which they can. We have had statutory public inquiries that have gone on for five or six years. I hope that will not be the case here. The Minister is endeavouring to work with the parents and advocates to see whether we can get a bespoke inquiry that will meet the needs and objectives of such an inquiry, which have to be to improve services and have a sustainable improvement in services for children with spina bifida and requiring spinal surgery.  Because of our Constitution and people's legal entitlements, very often these inquiries can evolve into adversarial-type inquiries. One concern we have, which we need to be very clear-eyed about, is the impact on current services. Presumably any inquiry would involve personnel working in the service. We have got to be very clear-eyed and ensure we design this in such a way that we maintain current services, and that we do not have any negative impact on the provision of services on an ongoing basis. A three-week timeline has been provided for work on this. I am confident that we can arrive at a conclusion to this that would be satisfactory all round. \n Deputy David Cullinane  The Taoiseach left out my questions. This is just a reminder. \n The Taoiseach  I have the reply to Deputy Cullinane somewhere. \n Deputy David Cullinane  The Taoiseach skipped over them. \n The Taoiseach  I apologise. They relate to mental health, early intervention and Jigsaw. I will talk to the Minister. There has been a significant growth in Jigsaw services across the country. I will talk to the Minister in respect of Waterford. I agree with the sentiments the Deputy has articulated. Jigsaw is a very good organisation. It has got a lot of good State support in recent years.  A decision has been taken on 24-7 cardiac services. Deputy Cullinane asked about the implementation and delivery of it. A lot of progress has been made on this agenda. I can see that all of the Deputies in Waterford work together. I appreciate that. We will keep the pressure on to get this done in a reasonable timeline.  Deputy Currie raised shingles. Again, we are now into costs. The health budget was €1.3 billion last year. It is an enormous budget. We have done a lot in recent years. I am a great believer in vaccines. They can save money too in terms of people having to be treated subsequently in the acute care system if they develop something like shingles, which can be very serious in its effect on the immune system, elderly people, and those with RSV in particular.  Deputy Conway-Walsh referred to the shortage of beds in Beaumont Hospital. I will speak to the Minister for Health. I ask the Deputy to send the details in respect of Mr. Keane to the Minister. It is shocking that he is waiting since 17 September. He obviously requires specialist care in Beaumont. We will see what can be done in that case. I take the Deputy's point. That relates to the first question I was asked by Deputy McAuliffe about projects that are under way in Beaumont to increase bed capacity and to get a greater flow of patients. ",

        "answerText": " The Taoiseach  I propose to take Questions Nos. 11 to 20, inclusive, together.  Ireland has accepted challenging emissions reduction targets at EU and national levels. Our programme for Government has reaffirmed the Government's determination that Ireland will play its full part in tackling what is a global issue.  We are seeing encouraging signs. Ireland's emissions have been falling for the last three years, and we now have lower overall emissions than at any point in the last 35 years, despite our population growing by 50% over that period.  Change is under way across our economy and society to realign ourselves to a low-carbon future. Reducing emissions is now at the heart of all our policies and sectors. We are seeing real progress in the areas of energy, transport, and agriculture; however, EPA projections make clear one thing: we must move faster and do more if we are to meet our targets for emissions reduction.  The Cabinet committee on climate action, environment and energy oversees implementation of programme for Government commitments on the environment, climate action, energy and emergency planning. It considers the wide range of issues that require action in Ireland's transition to a low-carbon, climate resilient and sustainable future: a future in which we take full advantage of the renewable energy potential that we possess, while ensuring that energy policies contribute to energy security, affordability and competitiveness.  The Cabinet committee also oversees implementation of the climate action plan. The committee meets quarterly. The last meeting took place on 7 July. The next meeting will be scheduled in due course. \n Deputy Peter 'Chap' Cleere  We all know there is a huge amount of work to be done on flood protection and flood mitigation. I acknowledge the €1.3 billion that has been set aside under the flood risk investment programme. Flooding in Ireland can have a significant impact on homes, businesses, people and communities. While I accept the problem of flooding cannot be eliminated, it can be managed or mitigated to reduce its likelihood, severity or impact. Flood relief schemes are complex projects. They require detailed engineering analysis and public engagement to make sure schemes will work and have the support of the whole community. Six such schemes have been approved in County Kilkenny – in Graiguenamanagh, Ballyhale, Freshford, Inistioge, Piltown and Thomastown. They are all at various stages. Could the Taoiseach give assurances to me and the people of Kilkenny today that these approved projects will be completed and fully funded? \n Deputy Malcolm Byrne  I am glad to see the Government has agreed to progress with the private wires Bill and the development of a private wires policy. It is critical to addressing the energy deficit we face that we move as soon as possible. It is also important that we ensure we have the necessary digital infrastructure to support the digital economy, and that includes data centres. I am sure the Taoiseach would agree with me that data centres, as a critical part of the economy, would benefit from the private wires Bill, in particular if they partner with renewable energy sources in order to be able to power them but also to engage in district heating systems such as the one we see in Tallaght. Could the Taoiseach indicate a timeframe for when we will be moving forward with the private wires legislation and when we may see companies being able to avail of it? In that context, would he envisage nuclear energy forming part of the solution? \n Deputy Naoise Ó Cearúil  In 2004 the Taoiseach introduced the smoking ban, which has saved thousands of lives. This week the EPA reported that approximately 1,700 premature deaths occur in Ireland every year due to poor air quality. A lot of this is due to the continuous burning of solid fossil fuels and traffic emissions. Will the Cabinet committee on climate action, environment and energy consider this report and look at actions to try to resolve it? \n Deputy Tony McCormack  The SEAI better energy warmer homes scheme is crucial for tackling climate change and energy poverty but in Offaly and across the country families are waiting up to two years for works to be completed - 12 months for a BER assessment, 14 months for a survey and further delays for retrofitting. Could the Taoiseach outline what steps are being taken, be it increasing the number of assessors and surveyors, streamlining the process or boosting delivery capacity to shorten waiting times so households can benefit much sooner from warmer, more energy efficient homes? \n Deputy Darren O'Rourke  There is a major issue with the retrofitting schemes that are in place. On the one hand, as the Climate Change Advisory Council states, the funding supports for heat pumps are not sufficient and this lock many people out of access to a heat pump. On the other hand, a heat pump is not a practical or feasible solution for many homes, in particular one-off rural homes. Very many people are locked out of access to a heat pump, but also locked out of low-emission and zero-emission alternatives, whatever they might be. The vast majority still have fossil fuels. There is potential for a significant improvement on what families are currently using, be it dirty solid fuels or kerosine. Will the Taoiseach consider reviewing the schemes to ensure that people can make progress? \n Deputy Ivana Bacik  The European Environment Agency's recent report is nothing short of damning. It sets out the reality for biodiversity and finds that Ireland's natural environment is in very poor condition. Some 85% of protected habitats and almost one third of protected species have an unfavourable status. It is clear that excessive car dependency, unsustainable food production and emissions that are simply not reducing at a fast enough rate are doing untold damage to biodiversity. We are seeing an outrageous situation in Dublin Bay with sewage being pumped into our waters. Swim bans are the norm on far too many beaches and there are fish kills on lakes and rivers with alarming regularity. We need urgent systemic action in this budget.  We need to ensure the budget will take climate seriously. Will the Taoiseach take the urgent action in this budget, which is so obviously needed, to invest in the protection of biodiversity and to reverse some of the decisions made? We are very concerned that the ban on imported fracked gas has been overturned and that it looks as if his Government is opening the door to more fossil fuel infrastructure. \n Deputy Paul Murphy  I welcome to the Gallery the relatives of the participants in the Global Sumud Flotilla.  The EU confirmed this week that nature in this country is in a very poor state and that economic growth has been achieved at the expense of the environment. Even in that context, the Blackwater fish kill stands out as an unprecedented ecocide - over 46,000 dead fish floating to the surface, bringing home the mass extinction event happening silently every day due to intensive, industrialised agriculture. It is incredible that none of our State agencies apparently can find the culprit. These are the agencies that are supposed to protect our environment. No wonder locals, anglers and environmentalists are convinced there must be a cover-up. It is scandalous that the investigations have discovered several other criminal polluters that we would never have known about without this event. What is the Taoiseach going to do about this? Will he properly resource protection and enforcement? Will he ensure that repeat offenders, like North Cork Creameries, which has had 122 non-compliance issues and is still non-compliant, are prosecuted and have their licences revoked? Will he stop defending the nitrates derogation and accept it is contributing to the devastation of our rivers? \n The Taoiseach  Deputy Cleere was the first into the fray, regarding flood schemes in Kilkenny. He gave a very articulate presentation of the challenges and complexities of flood schemes. They take a lot of time and consultation. Given the frequency and ferocity of storms today, we need to move faster with some of these schemes, because the devastation of a flood on a household or on a town, or on shops and businesses, is huge and shocking for people. The national development plan, NDP, has allocated substantial money and capital. We want to get all of those schemes approved. I do not have clear details as to where each scheme is right now. I have no doubt Deputy Cleere does, as he is a local TD for the area. He has listed six schemes. I will work with him to ensure those schemes are approved, fully funded and delivered. A lot will depend on the progress in terms of the execution of the issues.  Deputy Malcolm Byrne raised the issue of a private wires Bill. I think it is good legislation and I welcome the fact the Government has accepted a memorandum outlining the legislation and proposals and that we have agreed it, in that respect. We have challenges in terms of data centres, as Deputy Byrne knows. He has been specialising in AI for quite some time. AI will mean a much greater need for energy. It will be energy intensive. Data centres are going to be important in that regard. Offshore wind energy is critical for this. That is why I have convened a clearing house, involving industry and the Government, to deal with macro issues around delivering offshore wind generation as quickly as we possibly can to enable us to be adopters of AI and to maximise the potential of AI into the future. It will also allow us to deal with future industry needs in terms of major, larger sites the IDA will be acquiring to provide for industry well into the future. We have been working with the Commission for Regulation of Utilities, CRU, the Department of enterprise and others on that specific issue. I will come back to Deputy Byrne on the timeline for the legislation. My understanding is that it should not take that long.  On nuclear, we may very well import nuclear through various connectors. We are putting a lot of funding into wind energy, offshore wind in particular, and some onshore wind and some solar. It is interesting. There are people who have come to me in the House saying they are against solar energy, wind energy and fossil fuels. I do not know where we are going to get our energy if we do not have a combination of all three in the short term. We will need a combination of all three. From a State perspective, nuclear would entail a lot of capital investment. We are putting a lot of capital investment into the wind energy side. A lot of it will be private sector developed, but we have to do the ports and a lot of other stuff with that.  Deputy Naoise Ó Cearúil asked a question around premature deaths. The last Government did enact comprehensive legislation in respect of towns, and to make fully nationwide the ban on solid fuels. A lot of it was coming in from the North, actually, and it was leading to a deterioration in health quality. It was way back in the early 1990s that Mary Harney, the then Minister of State, brought in a ban in cities. People may not remember, but at 5 o'clock on a winter evening in Dublin you could hardly walk through Dublin because of the smog. You were breathing in awful stuff, and it was a radical move that improved health quality in cities. The issue will be enforcement. Local authorities and others need to do more on enforcement regarding air quality in towns across the country. Up to a couple of years ago, Enniscorthy had poor quality air on a par with some towns in India, because of the penetration of imported smoky coal getting in under the radar, not being properly monitored and a lack of enforcement. That is critical for health. Deaths, lung injury and COPD can be avoided if we just do the sensible thing.  Deputy Tony McCormack asked about the delays in delivering the SEAI, Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland, grants and the better energy warmer homes scheme. I take his point. The Minister is reviewing these schemes to see if he can get simpler grant schemes in place and maybe fast-track some of this. We will work on that. I appreciate the point Deputy McCormack has raised.  Deputy O'Rourke raised retrofitting heat pumps and an insufficiency of money. Again, huge money has gone into this in the last five years compared with what went on for the previous 20 years. There are limits to what the State can do with public expenditure, to remind the House of that every now and again. I am sure the Deputy reads the comments from the Irish Fiscal Advisory Council, the Economic and Social Research Institute, ESRI, and the Central Bank. They are suggesting - even a Deputy from the Labour Party has been very conscious about this - that we are spending far too much money on all of these schemes. We do need to be fiscally sustainable. That said, these are important schemes because they save energy in the future and save on household bills for people.  Deputy Bacik raised the issue of the natural environment. In the last five years, we have doubled the budget of the National Parks and Wildlife Service. I involved myself five years ago and met the NPWS. A board was created within the Department. It is an agency within the State. It has had lots of successes. For example, there has been good progress with the corncrake and the white-tailed eagle. We have created new national parks in the last number of years in the north east, and acquired the Conor Pass and marshes around Clonakilty. A lot of good progress has been made. We are dealing with the previous 20-odd years of progress and so on. The Infrastructure, Climate and Nature Fund needs to allocate money specifically for nature restoration and, in my view, for the acquisition of more land for rewilding and for national parks. We will continue on that track. Obviously, I am concerned about the report, and we need to respond to it.  Deputy Murphy raised the issue of the fish kill in the Blackwater, which is absolutely shocking but the EPA, Environmental Protection Agency, has not come up with a culprit for this. It is wrong to just throw up the charge of a cover-up. I do not think that is fair. I do not think it is fair on the EPA because I do not believe the EPA would cover it up. Equally, however, if the EPA cannot pinpoint the exact source of this pollution, it needs to be honest about that too. There is no point in getting ahead. Deputy Murphy would be the first person, in other walks of life, attacking the Garda or the justice system for getting ahead without any evidence. We have to have an evidence-based approach to this. North Cork Creameries has been involved in other compliance issues but not this one. There has been no tracing of it to this fish kill. It employs a lot of people and has been a very successful industry at other levels in that area, which is an area that has not been blessed with multinationals or with other industry. We have to balance the perspective. There is no evidence this fish kill was caused by the agriculture sector either, in terms of farming or anything like that, which the Deputy might have been suggesting, or maybe he had other targets in that regard.  That said, it is not satisfactory that we do not know how such a large fish kill happened. That is a worry. Is our scientific capacity up to speed? This is a major kill and will have major repercussions for biodiversity along the Blackwater and that area in its entirety. \n An Leas-Cheann Comhairle  The next group of questions is Nos. 21 to 32 but we only have five minutes left for this item of business. Therefore, with the agreement of the House, I will move to the next piece of business, which is the motion. Is that agreed? Agreed.  That concludes questions. \n Deputy Paul Murphy  It is agreed, but it is not satisfactory that we only ever get through two groups of questions. We are even losing five minutes today. We used to get six Question Time sessions per week. The Government got rid of Wednesday's Question Time against our objections. We are down to just Tuesday for Taoiseach's Questions and now, more weeks than not, we get through two groupings rather than three. It is on us as well, but we need to have a discussion about it. We should try to get through three groupings. \n An Leas-Cheann Comhairle  I suggest the Deputy raise it with the Ceann Comhairle or at the Business Committee meeting----- \n Deputy Paul Murphy  I have. \n An Leas-Cheann Comhairle  -----or maybe he can just be more efficient with the use of time. \n Deputy Ivana Bacik  It is unsatisfactory. I add my voice to that. We do need to raise this at the Business Committee. Clearly, the debate on the motion on the flotilla is hugely important. We all looked for that so on this occasion, there is no difficulty with moving straight to that debate. However, in principle, to have just two groupings of Taoiseach's Questions when we have all prepared for three is not acceptable and we need to change that. \n An Leas-Cheann Comhairle  Yes, but I have asked Members to bear in mind that they make contributions on the questions. There is an issue there as well. As I said, the Ceann Comhairle can deal with it in the context of the Business Committee or Members who are on that committee can raise it. \n The Taoiseach  I was up late last night preparing for the third grouping after watching the presidential debate. \n An Leas-Cheann Comhairle  I am sure you were. We can take it if you wish. \n The Taoiseach  It is fine. \n Deputy Ivana Bacik  I hope he watched the debate. It was very good. \n Deputy Paul Murphy  He tweeted about it anyway, although it looked like he did not watch it. \n The Taoiseach  I watched it and then I worked on the parliamentary questions. ",

        "answerText": " The Taoiseach  I propose to take Questions Nos. 1 to 9, inclusive, together.  The Cabinet committee on housing last met on Wednesday, 3 September, and will meet again in the coming weeks. The committee works to ensure a cross-government approach to the implementation of our commitments regarding housing policy. Housing supply has increased significantly over the past number of years, with almost 148,500 new homes delivered since the start of 2020. More people are buying their first home than in any period in well over a decade, with 2024 seeing first-time buyer mortgage drawdowns of over 26,000, supported by Government-backed measures such as the first home and help to buy schemes. However, we know that we must do more and that the scale of delivery of housing needs to be significantly increased in the coming years.  This is why we have prioritised a range of far-reaching measures and the deployment of significant funding since coming into government. This includes the allocation of €1.4 billion in additional capital funding for housing in 2025, bringing the total capital funding for housing programmes this year to €7.5 billion to support the provision of new social and affordable homes, bringing vacant homes back into residential use, second-hand acquisitions to prevent vulnerable households falling into homelessness and continuing to support homeowners under the defective concrete blocks grant scheme.  We have revised the national planning framework to enable local authorities to zone a significantly higher quantum of land.  We are implementing the Planning and Development Act at speed to reduce delays and bring greater consistency, clarity and stability to the planning system. We have agreed reforms to rent pressure zones which will strengthen the rights of tenants while helping to stimulate much-needed investment and development over the longer term. We have initiated the process to regulate the short-term lets market to balance the needs of tourism with the aim of increasing long-term rental supply. We have taken action to drive down the cost of construction through new guidelines on apartment standards. We continue to support key delivery partners such as the local authorities and the Land Development Agency, which have a significant and central role to play in the scaling-up of our housing supply. We have also taken action to get things moving quickly, including the extension to planning permissions which are about to expire and the introduction of a single-stage approval process for social housing projects, up to a value of €200 million.  Housing delivery, along with infrastructure and utility investment to enable delivery at scale, is at the centre of the recently agreed national development plan, which sets out a total investment of €275.4 billion, including €28 billion for housing programmes. As the largest ever capital investment plan in the history of the State, it will create the building blocks we need to deliver thousands of new homes through upgrading our water and energy infrastructure, delivery of roads and providing better public transport. We understand that the housing challenge impacts at many levels of our society, but clearly the impact is most acute and difficult for those who are homeless. Last week, the Minister, Deputy Browne, announced the prioritisation of €50 million for housing acquisitions to support larger families with children and housing first clients to exit long-term homeless emergency accommodation into safe, secure and permanent homes.  Building on these measures already taken, we are now in the process of finalising a new national housing plan for the next five years and beyond. Key issues we are working through as we finalise the plan include the promotion of innovation in the construction sector, the need for private finance at scale to complement unprecedented levels of State funding and ensuring the viability of apartment delivery. We are working with our colleagues across Government to find the right mix of measures to address these challenges. The new plan will be published in the coming weeks and I am confident that we can build on our success to date and achieve further momentum across all different areas of housing delivery over the lifetime of this Government. \n Deputy Mary Lou McDonald  I think the Taoiseach's assertion of such confidence is gravely misplaced, but how and ever. I wish to raise the issue of the Clashduv Road flats in Togher, in the Taoiseach's own constituency. I visited them in May with an Teachta Donnchadh Ó Laoghaire and Councillor Joe Lynch. As the Taoiseach knows, there are similar flats across the southside of Cork city, at Togher Road, Cherry Tree Road, Sycamore Place, Maple Place and Hazel Road. I am sure the Taoiseach is familiar with them. They date from the 1970s and are in a considerable state of disrepair. They are way beyond their lifespans. The balconies of the flats are in poor condition. There are issues with loose masonry. Iron bars surrounding balconies have rusted, and they are jagged and dangerous for children because of the condition they are in. There are really serious issues around damp, cold and mould in the flats, and there are a lot of respiratory issues among residents. Some of the blocks have subsidence and uneven floors. In many of the complexes, there are issues with rodents.  There is a dire and urgent need for regeneration of these complexes. The Housing Commission reported that these flats needed to be completely overhauled, at the very least. Cork City Council has agreed to knock another block of flats on Noonan's Road, yet the residents I met in Togher remain living in appalling conditions. They are very angry about that and understandably so. This is the Taoiseach's city. People are facing cold, damp, issues with rodents, cracks and hazardous fencing. I believe we need urgent regeneration of these complexes. Will the Taoiseach support this and will he ensure the funding is made available to the local authority to carry out that work? \n Deputy Ryan O'Meara  I am taking this question on behalf of Deputy John Connolly. The issue of wastewater treatment plants in our rural towns and villages is one I have raised with the Taoiseach before. I refer in particular, however, to Ballycommon in Cloughjordan in north County Tipperary, which I know he will be aware of from previous discussions here in this Chamber. With the quite large level of investment coming from the national development plan into Irish Water, I appreciate that cities and large towns will have to take a certain level of priority in terms of the numbers of houses delivered, but I am worried about our smaller towns and rural villages being left behind.  In Ballycommon in north Tipperary, 34 houses could be built right now were it not for a lack of capacity in the system. Two developers there would build a plant if they got permission. In Cloughjordan, my own village where I live, we have not seen a private development since the mid-2000s. The council cannot build and new businesses often cannot connect. The housing estate that has developer-provided infrastructure cannot be taken in charge by the council because there is no capacity in the system. These are two examples of villages like many others right across rural Ireland. Will the Government commit to ensuring Uisce Éireann will provide a scheme of funding for these smaller towns and villages through national development funding and that it will not just be our larger towns and cities that will be looked at? \n Deputy Séamus McGrath  At the outset, if I may, I will mark the passing of Councillor Patrick Gerard Murphy from Cork. I served with Councillor Murphy for 17 years on Cork County Council. He was a great friend and colleague. His untimely passing is dreadfully sad for his family, friends and community. I wanted to add my voice to condolences here, and I thank the Ceann Comhairle.  I thank the Taoiseach for his update on the housing subcommittee and the housing plan. Downsizing options for people are a critical issue and come up quite a lot on the doorsteps. I hope there will be additional policy in the new, updated plan to provide additional downsizing options for people, whether that is a rightsizing scheme such as that run by Cork City Council being rolled out further across the country or suitable retirement-type, single-storey housing being provided for people. Obviously, downsizing needs to be on a voluntary basis and entirely up to the individual, but many people whose incomes have reduced find themselves living in larger properties that were traditionally family homes with additional running and maintenance costs. These people want options but, unfortunately, they are not there at present. I think this has to be a core element of the new housing plan. I ask the Taoiseach to please take that back to the committee and work on it as part of the upcoming plan. \n Deputy Tom Brabazon  Last week, the Minister for housing, James Browne, approved significant equity loan funding for the development of 85 new cost-rental homes in Belmayne in Dublin 13 in my constituency. As the Taoiseach knows, many renters find themselves earning too much to qualify for social housing and are not able to afford the market rents. This project and funding, therefore, is very welcome and I would love to see far more of these projects and certainly more affordable housing as well.  On cost rental, is it possible for the Cabinet committee to look at a pathway to ownership in the context of this scheme? I refer to cases where people have proven themselves capable over time of being able to continue and maintain paying those rents. \n Deputy Martin Daly  Housing is the singular issue of this Dáil and this generation. The new planning framework has gone to the local authorities. What has been the response from the local authorities and what initiatives will the Government take to ensure its instructions to increase the rezoning of land will be carried through at a local level? The development of wastewater treatment plans, and developer-led wastewater treatment plants, would serve small towns and villages very well, as Deputy O'Meara pointed out. There is a pent-up demand for development in small towns and villages but the problem is infrastructure. Of course, there is also the aspect of increasing our energy infrastructure. I know the Government is putting huge resources into development of the grid and the production of electricity, as well as looking at the off-site construction solutions that can ramp up supply rapidly in Ireland. \n Deputy Ivana Bacik  We know the level of homelessness is at record highs. The key to tackling homelessness and the housing crisis is ensuring increased supply, but the number of planning permissions for new housing is falling and house prices and rents are rising. We were originally led to believe the Government's new housing plan would be published over the summer. It was then delayed, and now it is said it will be later this year. When will the Government's plan be published?  Specifically on the Land Development Agency, a report from the Department of Finance has found the agency will only make a small contribution, it seems, to the Government's housing targets. Can the Taoiseach confirm how many homes will be delivered by the LDA this year and next year? Will the Government resource it to ramp up supply, as we in the Labour Party have proposed?  On the student housing strategy, there has again been a delay in publishing it. Yet at this time, as freshers' weeks are in place across the country, we are seeing students struggling to find a secure place to rent at any sort of affordable price.  When will we see a student accommodation strategy? \n Deputy James Geoghegan  In relation to the SPV structure for the Dublin city task force, I want to ask when will that be established. Is legislation necessary, and, if so, when will that legislation come? Obviously, all of that relates to the Dublin city task force and a key part of that is getting over-the-shop living in Dublin city centre. Some of that work is under way on a piloted basis on Middle Abbey Street by the Dublin City Council teams but what we need to see is a wholesale approach of getting people living in the city and a mixed typology of housing in the city centre. There are a lot of good things taking place in Dublin at present, such as getting the fruit market open. There will be a tender out for the library in the Parnell cultural quarter, but we have get more people living in the city centre. I need to see that level of urgency when it comes to getting the SPV structure. Hopefully, the budget will be supportive of the work that the Dublin city task force will be doing. \n Deputy Ruairí Ó Murchú  We really have to give consideration to housing adaptation grants and to look at them properly. We know they have been reviewed. Both the thresholds and the amounts paid have been increased but this does not cover the cost of building. I am talking in particular about those who fall into disability, whether down to old age, accidents, or children coming of age and needing a greater level of supports. We have all had these sorts of issues and occasionally got them across the line, but every year we have a case where the local authority runs out of funding. It stops taking applications and we all try to make representations on behalf of those worst cases. We need to get a system that works.  We still need to update the situation in relation to CAS funding as regards disabilities. I have spoken to the Taoiseach previously about St. John of God approved housing body not being able to draw down the money it could previously. While there have been solutions to some of the issues, we need that dealt with.  When are we to see the rural one-off housing review report, which last summer was with the Attorney General, because we know the issues that exist in rural areas in relation to people not being able to get planning permission for necessary housing? \n Deputy Mark Ward  I do not know how the Taoiseach has done it but he has pulled off an amazing feat of illusion. Somehow the Taoiseach has normalised the housing crisis. I want to be clear that it is not normal for people to be still living in the back bedrooms of their parents' homes. It is not normal that rents have skyrocketed and that most young people feel they will not be able to buy their own home. It is not normal to have 16,000 citizens of this country homeless, as we speak, and over 5,000 children, at this moment, staying in emergency accommodation.  It is also not normal to knowingly and willingly push more people into homeless accommodation but that is exactly what the Government has done by scrapping the tenant in situ scheme. I heard what the Taoiseach said to Deputy Ó Broin a few minutes ago. That is exactly what the Government has done. It has tied the hands of local authorities in relation to the tenant in situ scheme. The Government actually got something right in the last term by introducing this scheme. What does the Government do when it gets something right? It pulls the plug. I ask that the Government reinstates fully the tenant in situ scheme and gives local authorities the means and the ability to purchase homes to stop families and children going into homelessness. \n Deputy Paul Murphy  Since the Government lifted the eviction ban in April 2023, more than 20,000 households have got eviction notices because their landlord wants to sell. At the time, the Government promised renters that they would be protected with the tenant in situ scheme. If they were on HAP or RAS and their landlord was willing to sell to the council, the council would buy their home. That has turned out to be a lie.  Just over 2,500 households benefited from the scheme before the Government gutted it less than two years after it started. The results are seen in the homelessness figures - a massive rise from 12,000 in March 2023 to over 16,000 today, including over 5,000 children. According to the latest figures, in quarter 2 of 2024, 349 families were prevented from entering homelessness as a result of the tenant in situ scheme and in quarter 2 of 2025, that was down to 122. Will the Taoiseach take emergency action, reinstate the eviction ban, and reimplement the tenant in situ scheme and properly fund it? \n The Taoiseach  There are a lot of questions there. At the outset, I will say that Cork City Council has a good record generally in terms of regeneration. Particularly in one half of that Togher area, there was very successful early regeneration but, in fairness, it did not cover the Cherry Tree Road side or the Clashduv Road Flats. I would, of course, support the regeneration of those flats and, indeed, Noonan's Road, which has been awaiting regeneration for quite some time. Councillors have been particularly involved in that. We will continue to support regeneration.  In response to Deputy O'Meara's point, we have had discussions with Irish Water. I referenced the Cloughjordan case as illustrative of the need to facilitate developer-led wastewater treatment plants in small rural villages and towns because Irish Water has readily acknowledged that it will not be able to get those towns and villages notwithstanding the enormous allocations that we have given to Irish Water. There has to be pragmatism and realism, but it would oversee the construction and installation of those wastewater treatment plants and then would have a monitoring scenario with local authorities in respect of their efficacy and so on. That is something we are pushing strongly. We will get to a situation where that happens and that would release some housing, in particular, across rural Ireland.  Deputy McGrath is correct. Cork City Council was probably one of the first councils to develop a very innovative approach to downsizing and it won a national award for the scheme on the Skehard Road. This was where people moved out of existing three-bedroom or four-bedroom properties that they owned and downsized by agreement. As a result, they had some extra personal funding. In any event, it worked well. That should continue all over the country as an option because we have not used existing housing stock optimally. We have to continue to look at ways of incentivising the utilisation of existing housing stock. Airbnb has absorbed an awful lot of existing housing stock in cities as well to the detriment of the rental market and the residential and housing market.  In response to Deputy Brabazon in terms of the cost-rental pathway to ownership, it is early days yet in terms of building up cost rental as one particular strand within a menu of options for people endeavouring to get housing, either at affordable rent or at affordable purchase cost. That is something we will continue to keep under review.  Deputy Daly raised a number of issues. The wastewater treatment plants issue was similar to that raised by Deputy O'Meara. On the planning framework, it is the case that we need greater speed from the local authorities in respect of following through on the planning framework and they need to rezone more land because the ESRI is saying the Government has adopted a 50,000 per annum assessment of need. That is a needs-based target and we have to work out how we get there. The ESRI is saying we need 50,000 a year. Some are saying we need 60,000. That cannot be done without rezoning and yet it is clear to us that certain CEOs are humming and hawing about rezoning. I have been talking to councillors and proposals have not come to the table. I understand Dublin City Council is saying that it will not rezone and that it has enough land. I believe Fingal is in a similar situation.  There is a housing crisis out there. In response to Deputy Ward, I have not normalised anything. I am very clear about this. The cost of housing is excessive for young couples. That is why we need to rezone land and get more houses built and that has to happen over a ten-year period to get on top of the situation. We have moved from approximately 20,000 in 2019 or 2020 to 32,000, 33,000 or maybe 34,000 a year. That was a big shift from 2020 but we have to go much further than that. That needs both public sector and private sector investment. \n Deputy Mark Ward  Dropping the 40,000----- \n The Taoiseach  Deputy Daly is also correct in terms of the development of the grid and off-site and modern methods of construction. We are driving that because that will also be key in accelerating the construction of housing.  On the rezoning issue, there are legislative options available to the Minister to mandate - he has already instructed, but to go ahead and get it done - but, ideally, the councillors, with the officials, should do it. There will be engagement between the Minister and me and CEOs of county councils to drive that agenda.  Deputy Bacik raised the issue of homelessness and the new housing plan. The new housing plan will be published within the next number of weeks. It made sense that we would get the national development plan done first in terms of having the capital framework over the next five years for the public sector investment underpinning housing announced.  We have not waited for the plan. We have taken measures that, ordinarily, would have ended up in the plan, such as the rent pressure zone review, the change in the apartment criteria and the national planning framework. There is also the initiative the Minister has taken in respect of homelessness, including the €50 million he announced last week for acquisitions to take families off the homeless list through a more direct approach. I will come back to the Deputy on the student accommodation strategy.  The LDA has a significant pipeline. Although I do not have the exact figures with me, thousands of houses will come onstream in the next number of years. Some significant advance work has been done on particular sites that the LDA has acquired and completed plans and designs for them. As the Deputy knows, it has completed significant projects and there are more to come. There are aspects of that finance report that I do not entirely agree with. The LDA will still have a significant contribution to make, along with local authorities and affordable housing bodies.  In response to Deputy Geoghegan, work is under way on the structure for the implementation of the Dublin city task force, and that is continuing. When we have the details, we will come back to the House in respect of that.  Living over shops in our cities is key and that also applies to the living city initiative. The existing scheme is quite limited and has had limited impact, so it is under review. We have had some discussions on that and apart from any task force, it would apply to a number of cities. There are also towns that could do with commercial conversions of over-the-shop accommodation to residential. The future in many urban centres will have to be more residential. The city living experience is changing.  Deputy Ó Murchú referred to the housing adaptation grants. I have spoken to the Minister and I am well aware that we have had very substantial grants. I would make the point to everybody that there has never been more capital allocated to housing and to this area. It is enormous funding. We are at the limits of growth in public expenditure and it is significant in terms of the overall fiscal framework. The adaptation grants are very important for senior citizens and people with disabilities.  The rural one-off housing guidelines are necessary. The Minister is working to update them because we need to give greater options to people living in rural Ireland, particularly those living on their own land, given the cost of housing. We need to ensure they are in a position to develop housing for themselves. Given the advances that have been made in wastewater treatment facilities, this is something that should be accommodated.  I have dealt with the question from Deputy Ward. We are not normalising anything. We are very clear that we need consistent and sustainable investment in all aspects of housing in the time ahead.  In response to Deputy Murphy, if we maintained the eviction ban, we would suffocate supply and we would have fewer houses. We are not going with the Deputy's agenda in many respects because we think his agenda would be even more damaging and would not ensure an increase in housebuilding, particularly in the private sector.  The tenant in situ scheme has been very significant in the past two years. It needed refinement so that it is not used by councils as an excuse to just acquire instead of build. It has to be focused and targeted at those most in need. \n Deputy Mary Lou McDonald  The Government has run out of money. \n The Taoiseach  It was never meant for the landlords to sell. The focus was always on tenants who were in danger of being made homeless. Examples have emerged. For example, in some local authorities, no sooner was a house acquired than enormous funds were immediately put into retrofitting it and so on. That was never the original objective of the scheme. It was to get houses acquired to stop them from being sold and to stop someone from being made homeless. Some councils did not operate the scheme as it should have been operated. I know the Opposition just wants to keep on throwing money at every scheme and not review or examine it. \n Deputy Paul Murphy  It is a good scheme. \n The Taoiseach  There are issues that the Minister has examined. He found things that, in our view, were not in accordance with the original objectives of the scheme. The scheme has not been shelved or dropped, as has been suggested. \n Deputy Mary Lou McDonald  The Government has run out of money. \n Deputy Paul Murphy  My council has run out of money, the city council has run out of money, Carlow and Kilkenny county councils have run out of money and Fingal County Council has run out of money. \n The Taoiseach  Many cases were raised with regard to city councils and I tested this with one or two. In some cases that were raised in the House, they got sorted. \n Deputy Paul Murphy  The Dublin councils have run out of money. \n The Taoiseach  Hold on a second. They got sorted because the council could sort it. They are not helpless either. \n Deputy Paul Murphy  The Government has strangled the scheme. ",

        "answerText": " The Taoiseach  I propose to take Questions Nos. 10 to 16, inclusive, together.  The Cabinet committee on children and education oversees the implementation of programme for Government commitments in the area of children and education. It receives detailed reports on identified policy areas, such as child poverty, well-being and education. The membership of the Cabinet committee on children and education comprises the Taoiseach, Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, and Defence and the Ministers for Finance, Public Expenditure, Infrastructure, Public Service Reform and Digitalisation, Children, Disability and Equality, Health, Social Protection, Education and Youth and Housing, Local Government and Heritage.  The programme for Government contains many important commitments intended to improve the lives of all children, especially those children who need our help most. These commitments include: setting an ambitious child poverty target; progressively increasing the child support payment; expanding eligibility for the fuel allowance to families in receipt of the working family payment; and exploring a targeted child benefit payment.  Just last week, the Minister for Social Protection and I published the new child poverty target. The target is that, by 2030, no more than 3% of children should be living in consistent poverty. This would be the lowest figure in our history and would put us among the very best performers in Europe. That said, no figure is acceptable in terms of any child being in consistent poverty. Investment in education is central to this work to address child poverty and disadvantage. The Government’s vision for education is to deliver a world class education system that breaks down barriers and ensures every child can achieve their full potential. That is why we remain committed to building on the work of the DEIS programme, which, since 2006, has been operating to tackle educational disadvantage. We are looking at a DEIS plus programme to support schools in areas with the most deprivation and disadvantage.  The Cabinet committee meets quarterly and met for the second time recently. It will meet again in the period ahead. \n Deputy Mary Lou McDonald  I want to raise the current situation of Gaelscoil Coláiste Mhuire. As the Taoiseach knows, it is located on Parnell Square in Dublin. This school was at the centre of a shocking and very violent attack in November 2023. The ramifications of that day are still deeply felt within the school community emotionally and, in some cases, physically. In the aftermath of this horrific event, it was hoped there would be a renewed urgency in delivering a new, long overdue and much-needed permanent school building, something that has been promised for years and years. Despite false deadlines, hopes and promises, this has yet to happen. Construction on the school has been delayed again.  Gaelscoil Coláiste Mhuire is due to move temporarily to accommodation on Cathal Brugha Street. It is an interim solution to a long-term problem, bringing more questions than answers. When will all the necessary works be completed to allow the school to move to the proposed temporary building on Cathal Brugha Street? Can the Taoiseach confirm that the school will have exclusive and full use of the temporary premises? Most importantly of all, when will the building of the long-awaited and much-needed school building recommence? There cannot be further delays. \n Deputy Ryan O'Meara  I would like to raise a number of cases that have arisen in Nenagh recently regarding school transportation for special classes. A number of new classes opened this year at second level. Three families are in contact with me who, two or three years ago, enrolled their children in the closest available school at the time, which is now their most appropriate school place. However, they are being told by the school transportation section that they are not entitled to school transport because there is a vacancy in a closer school. There seems to be a way to work this out. We are getting letters from schools, confirmation from parents and so on, but we need to examine the policy. We are opening more and more special classes. There are a considerable number opening in north Tipperary this year and we expect more next year. In cases where children are already settled in their most appropriate school environment, families should not have to go through this rigmarole of getting on to TDs or schools to get letters to fit the criteria and a technical policy. We should be able to examine the policy and get that ironed out while these school places continue to be expanded. \n Deputy Aisling Dempsey  The programme for Government committed to reducing childcare costs to €200 per month per child.  Families across the country are under financial pressure. It is imperative that this commitment is delivered on within the lifetime of this Government. I urge the Taoiseach to ensure it remains a key focus of the Cabinet committee on children and education. Affordable childcare----- \n The Taoiseach  Which commitment? Was it childcare? \n Deputy Aisling Dempsey  Childcare, yes. Affordable childcare is not only essential for parents, but also for workforce participation, equality and the well-being of children. I appreciate it is complex and I appreciate the work already undertaken by the Minister, Deputy Norma Foley, to realise this commitment but could the Taoiseach outline any progress to date and when we can expect further progress? \n Deputy Catherine Ardagh  I join my colleagues in expressing sympathy to the family of Patrick Gerard Murphy, who was a friend to a lot of us.  Today, I raise the issue of mild general learning disability schools. Department of Education and Youth officials have a widespread misunderstanding of exactly what they do and they are now being forced to redesignate. There are 29 mild schools in the country, 14 of which cater for children at a post-primary level. They are appropriate school settings for children with mild general learning disabilities and the prove of this is in the pudding with 95% of graduates from mild schools entering the workforce, compared to just 30% of those with a mild diagnosis in the general population who go on to enter the workforce.  One such school in my area is Scoil Eoin. It is a wonderful school with fantastic staff but it wants to keep its designation. It is really unfair and it is not inclusive to change the designation of mild schools to more complex schooling. Will the Taoiseach commit to ensuring these schools will not have their designation changed on them by the Department? \n Deputy Tom Brabazon  Since my election to this House, I have been contacted by numerous principals, teachers and parents of primary school children who say they are finding the management of the capitation grant of €224 per pupil becoming increasingly difficult. The increasing energy costs, insurance costs and other operational costs have increased the financial burden on schools and stress on school principals, in particular. Can this be examined in the context of the upcoming budget? The ask of some of the principals is that there be an additional €75 per pupil in the grant. Could that be considered? \n Deputy Erin McGreehan  The Government has done an awful lot of work on bringing the cost of education down with schemes like free meals and free books. However, another cost that has been placed on parents trying to get their kids back to secondary school is really expensive laptops for each child. Laptops cost from €500 to €700 and even more, and every child who starts secondary school - in the schools I am familiar with - have this cost now. That is a huge expense on families. Yes, we have taken away one burden but the education system has put another burden on top of that. If you have a couple of children in school, and children are children so laptops break, there will be quite an expensive run on laptops every few years.  Will there be research into screen time and using laptops for homework and exams. Everything that is done on laptops for children as young as 12 up to 17 years of age. Has the Department of Education and Youth conducted research? The old pen and paper is disregarded and pupils are now on screens constantly, along with that huge expense. \n Deputy Eoin Hayes  Last week, the Taoiseach published an op-ed in the Irish Independent declaring that the time to end child poverty is now. That sentiment is very welcome but his analysis was incomplete. Yesterday, my party leader rightly pointed out that consistent child poverty has doubled in the past two years to 8.5% when the Government's target is 3%. Earlier this month, the ESRI published a report that one in every five children - more than 225,000 - are now in poverty when housing costs are taken into account.  The Taoiseach said earlier that he is committed to employment and economically sustainable finances but what good is employment if it is the most unequal market income in the developed world? How sustainable is a doubling of child poverty? At a webinar on child poverty held by the Children's Rights Alliance last week, the deputy Secretary General of the Department of Social Protection rightly said: \"If a family does not have access to secure and affordable housing, it is almost impossible to provide the services required to lift them out of poverty.\" Will the Taoiseach and his sub-committee outline the targeted approach to child poverty, including housing? Will he acknowledge the devastating role his housing policies, that he has voted for over the previous decade, have played in escalating child poverty? \n Deputy Pádraig O'Sullivan  I raise the issue of childcare with the Taoiseach as well. Mary Geary's Childcare is one of the largest providers in the country. It is actually based in Carrigtohill, which is in Deputy O'Connor's constituency, but many of the families who use it reside in my constituency. It has 450 children from 300 families. The parents of those children were recently faced with a fee hike of 34%. This is because the provider decided to remove itself from the public core funding model. It did this reluctantly because there is a situation where some of these large providers are capped at a certain level, which I think is in the region of €750,000, which they cannot go over. This is an example of a large provider but the pressure that is put on us locally in terms of families trying to source alternative childcare is enormous and has been felt deeply.  A survey carried out online recently by Indeed, the hiring company, where 1,000 parents were surveyed with 70% saying that childcare accessibility has affected their ability to work and one quarter of all respondents finding they either had to cut their hours or rearrange their work schedule to accommodate the childcare gap. This is now more than a family issue; this is an economic issue. \n Deputy Paul Murphy  The discussion about the State failing children will dominate the coming Dáil term but there is no greater failure than the State losing track of and failing children who it is meant to be taking care of. Just a couple of hours ago, we heard that the body of Daniel Aruebose has been found. We know he went missing four years ago, when he was just three years old. He would have been seven now. Incredibly, when reading the story, it appears the State became aware he was missing because of checks carried out on social welfare payments. What does it say about the nature of the State that better track is being kept of social welfare payments than vulnerable children?  Tragically, Daniel is far from the only child to fall through the cracks. Kyran Durnin has still not been found. In 2023, 29 young people known to Tusla died. Earlier this week, a school principal said there are huge gaps and holes in the system and that no one is looking for children who are not turning up to school, which is incredible. What will be done to ensure we stop failing children in this way? \n Deputy Peadar Tóibín  I raise the case of Daniel Aruebose as well and the fact that his remains have been found in north Dublin. It is incredible that a three-year-old boy would go missing from State care. I want to express my deepest sympathies to the relatives of this small boy. Daniel has been failed by the State. It is horrific and damning that we have a situation where the State was searching for the remains of two boys who were either in State care or known to State care and were no longer being tracked by State care. Daniel is among 254 children who have died in the past ten years either in State care or known to State care. Until yesterday, he was among dozens of children who are missing currently from State care.  The children's ombudsman has blasted the lack of structures the State has provided to properly investigate the deaths of vulnerable children. He stated there were no statutory powers to investigate these deaths and no powers to compel information from public bodies and services. We also have had the news that Tusla will conduct well-being checks into 42,000 children whose cases were closed during the Taoiseach's Government's Covid restrictions. That is a very serious situation about that Government's handling of the Covid crisis. \n An Leas-Cheann Comhairle  The Deputy should conclude. \n Deputy Peadar Tóibín  The fact there is not a proper investigation with statutory powers to investigate those is absolutely wrong as well. What funding will the Taoiseach provide Tusla to make sure it can do the work to investigate those closed cases? \n An Leas-Cheann Comhairle  The Deputy should conclude. \n Deputy Peadar Tóibín  Will the Taoiseach provide statutory powers to investigate these shocking deaths? \n Deputy Ruairí Ó Murchú  I also add my voice to the two cases that have been spoken: Kyran Durnin and Daniel Aruebose. The only good news is that at least Daniel's body was found. We are talking about an absolutely tragic set of circumstances and families who had engaged with Tusla.  I have no doubt we all know and are aware of the issues. We know that we need to make sure that, first of all, we have the correct frameworks and protocols for child protection, and that they are then adhered to. There is no doubt we need reviews in these two cases. First and foremost, anyone with information should go to the Garda, but we also need reviews to be carried out, and not behind closed doors. We must ensure that learnings are learnt and less of this can happen in the future, because it is disastrous.  I have spoken here many times previously of the failure to intervene early with families and those who need support. What was brought up at the children's committee was the idea of specialist public health nurses, which was contained within the early years policy framework but was not followed up. The idea is that there would be an initial positive engagement with families involving screening----- \n An Leas-Cheann Comhairle  The Deputy should conclude. \n Deputy Ruairí Ó Murchú  -----so if there is a need for resources, they could be put in early before things become disastrous or tragic. In some cases, it is all about child protection. We need absolute supports and protection of the child. \n An Leas-Cheann Comhairle  I thank the Deputy. \n Deputy Ruairí Ó Murchú  We are failing at this point. We must look back and learn so we know where we must go in the future. \n An Leas-Cheann Comhairle  The time for questions to the Taoiseach will conclude at 4.33 p.m. The Taoiseach should bear that in mind when he responds. \n The Taoiseach  In response to Deputy McDonald, the issue with Gaelscoil Choláiste Mhuire was a contractual one. It was not a case of the Government pulling the plug or anything like that. The Deputy and I know that. I will ask the Minister to communicate directly with her. I presume she has been in touch with the Minister for education on the matter and also on the use of Cathal Brugha Street. It is an interim solution. The situation is very unsatisfactory. My understanding from the last time we discussed this is that it is a contractual disagreement.  Deputy O'Meara raised school transport. He is absolutely correct. No one should have to go through that rigmarole. Common sense and flexibility should apply. I will speak to the Minister in respect of the issues he raises.  Deputy Dempsey spoke about affordable childcare. Much progress has been made to date. There was a major issue with places this time round. We are always trying to balance the number of places, access to places, cost, and support for staff. We will have good proposals again coming forward and substantial moneys being made available to the joint labour committee for an increase, but developmental career pathways for people working in childcare is still an issue.  Deputy Ardagh raised the proposal by the Department of education to redesignate 29 schools, which I heard about in recent days. I will pursue that with the Minister. These are very important schools, which fulfil a very clear purpose. I am aware of them in my own constituency as well. A different approach should be adopted. I will have to talk to the Minister for education in respect of this, as well as the Minister of State with responsibility for special education. The school the Deputy referenced in her constituency is Scoil Eoin.  I agree with Deputy Brabazon that capitation is a significant issue. We did increase it significantly during and after Covid to levels that had not previously been seen but I acknowledge that, nonetheless, the cost of living impacts on schools as well, in particular energy costs.  Deputy McGreehan made a point about research into the advent of technology and tried and trusted methods of education. A lot of research has been done which shows that technology is not all it is made out to be in terms of the development of the child, the learning process and creativity, but it can be a significant additional aid to learning. We have to work with schools on how to best ensure a reduction in costs for parents in particular, given the cost of iPads. Mechanisms can be developed in that regard. There are limits to public expenditure. We have done great work in reducing costs in recent years, but there are limits to what we can do.  Deputy Hayes's party specialises in articulating that life in Ireland is miserable. That tends to be the----- \n Deputy Eoin Hayes  I never said that. \n The Taoiseach  That is how the party goes about it. \n Deputy Eoin Hayes  I did not say that. \n The Taoiseach  Everything is bad. \n Deputy Eoin Hayes  The Taoiseach should not put words in my mouth. \n The Taoiseach  I am not putting words in his mouth. \n Deputy Eoin Hayes  I did not say it. \n The Taoiseach  What he is saying is that everything has doubled – unemployment----- \n Deputy Eoin Hayes  I am quoting the ESRI. \n The Taoiseach  He said it is the most unequal employment market in the world----- \n Deputy Eoin Hayes  The Government funds the ESRI. \n The Taoiseach  -----at a time when we had 500,000 extra jobs in five years. \n Deputy Eoin Hayes  The OECD brought us that information. The Department of Finance gives it to us. \n The Taoiseach  Yes, but who has the highest school completion rates in Europe? \n Deputy Eoin Hayes  I told the Taoiseach about the----- \n The Taoiseach  Who has the better progression rates? \n An Leas-Cheann Comhairle  Deputy Hayes should please allow the Taoiseach to address the question. \n The Taoiseach  This country has. All I am saying is that we should have a bit of balance. I know the Deputy might be a bit, you know - but he should take it handy. A bit of balance would be appropriate in terms of the different narratives. \n Deputy Eoin Hayes  The Taoiseach is not answering the question. \n The Taoiseach  We have a lot of things to do. I have always acknowledged that.  We had a national child poverty summit recently. Deputy Hayes might be aware of that.  I can inform Deputy O'Sullivan that approximately 90% of providers are in the scheme at the moment. Some did opt out. I have spoken to the Minister for Children, Disability and Equality, Deputy Foley, who has arrived beside me in the Chamber. There is a cap of €750,000 for the larger users. If fees are going up by 34% that will have a big impact on the community for the 450 children the Deputy referred to. It seems that some people are going out into the private market thinking they can get that, which is a problem. It is regrettable if people leave the scheme. They should do everything they possibly can to stay in it for the benefit of the parents, and work with the Department in that regard.  Deputies Murphy and Tóibín raised the discovery of Daniel today. I do not accept the automatic impulse to blame the State. There needs to be a better analysis of this in advance of jumping to blame. \n Deputy Peadar Tóibín  We should know whether it has been researched or investigated. \n The Taoiseach  Deputy Tóibín used a phrase which I wrote down referring to a three-year old boy who went \"missing from State care\". This is his classic propagandising of a situation. It is regrettable that he would adopt such a cynical attitude, because that boy did not go missing while in State care. Does the Deputy accept that? \n Deputy Peadar Tóibín  I accept that he was not tracked by State care. \n The Taoiseach  No, I am not asking Deputy Tóibín that. Does he accept he did not go missing while in State care? \n Deputy Peadar Tóibín  I accept that his case was closed----- \n An Leas-Cheann Comhairle  Could the Taoiseach address his remarks through the Chair? \n The Taoiseach  I apologise. I should have done it through the Chair. \n An Leas-Cheann Comhairle  We are over time. \n The Taoiseach  The point I am trying to make is----- \n Deputy Peadar Tóibín  There needs to be a structure to investigate these cases. The ombudsman says there is not. \n The Taoiseach  Yes, but the chair of the national review panel gave a very robust articulation of its role, and the effectiveness of its role. There are ongoing issues in terms of legislation and so on that can be progressed, but that should not be conflated with what happened with Daniel. We need to await the outcome and get the facts first before we jump to conclusions. \n Deputy Peadar Tóibín  The ombudsman said there is not a statutory organisation to get the facts. That is a damning statement. \n The Taoiseach  I have observed Deputy Tóibín's position on this for quite some time, and the overriding objective seems to be to blame Tusla for every child in the country who goes missing. That is wrong. \n Deputy Peadar Tóibín  Is there any responsibility? \n The Taoiseach  There can be wrongdoing or neglect in some cases but Deputy Tóibín raises it in every case. That is wrong. \n Deputy Peadar Tóibín  No. \n The Taoiseach  It is unfair to those working in Tusla and to social workers. \n An Leas-Cheann Comhairle  We will conclude. \n The Taoiseach  That is what I believe. \n Deputy Paul Murphy  Does the Taoiseach know that Tusla lost track of this boy? \n Deputy Peadar Tóibín  The Taoiseach is not being correct. \n Deputy Ruairí Ó Murchú  Specialist public health nurses----- \n An Leas-Cheann Comhairle  The time is up, so we are moving on. \n The Taoiseach  I apologise to Deputy Ó Murchú.

The DART+ South West project will involve the extension of DART services from the City Centre to Hazelhatch and Celbridge, including four-tracking from Park West to Heuston.  Following the submission of a Railway Order application for DART+ South-West to An Coimisiún Pleanála in March 2023, full planning approval was granted in November 2024. In addition, procurement for DART+ South West is progressing with pre-qualification questionnaires (PQQ) notices for Design and Build works advertised in May 2025.  The NTA Greater Dublin Area Transport Strategy 2022-2042, which was adopted by the Minister for Transport and published in January 2023, has identified the potential for opening a new railway station at Cabra to better serve the suburb and surrounding areas. Cabra sits within the section of track that will be addressed by the DART+ South West project, and the NTA has provided funding to Iarnród Éireann this year for the preparation of designs and planning for the station. A public information campaign on Cabra Train Station was held by Iarnród Éireann from 26th June to 2nd July.  Noting the NTA's responsibility in the matter, I have referred the Deputy's question to the NTA for a more detailed reply.

        "answerText": " Minister for Education and Youth  I should explain that applications relating to the provision of funding for issues relating to an existing school building can fall under a number of different delivery mechanisms including, most frequently, the Summer Works Scheme and the Emergency Works Scheme.  The purpose of the Emergency Works Scheme (EWS) is to provide funding specifically for unforeseen emergencies. It does so by ensuring the availability of funding for urgent works to those schools that are in need of resources as a result of an emergency situation.  An emergency is deemed to be a situation which poses an immediate risk to health, life, property, or the environment, which is sudden, unforeseen and requires immediate action, and in the case of a school, if not corrected would prevent the school or part thereof from opening.  The EWS operates on the basis of the minimal scope of works required to remedy an emergency situation. The EWS usually provides an interim solution until such time as a comprehensive solution can be provided under the Summer Works Scheme.  With regards to St John Bosco Junior School, the school submitted an application for funding under the Emergency Works Scheme (EWS) for roof works. The EWS operates on the basis of a minimal scope of works required to remedy an emergency situation and, on this basis, the school was advised to submit a revised scope of works with an accompanying itemised cost breakdown. Once this has been received the EWS team will review the revised application and will engage further with the school as appropriate. The EWS team is aware of the urgent nature of the works required and will keep the school informed throughout the process.  In relation to Mary, Help of Christians Girls National School, there are currently no outstanding Emergency Works application for this school. ",

        "answerText": " Minister of State at the Department of Education and Youth  While the provision of clinical therapy supports to children is the responsibility of the Health Service Executive (HSE), my department is working with the Department of Health, the Department of Children, Disability and Equality and the HSE to develop and strengthen more coherent structures to enable children and young people to access therapeutic supports across both health and education.  Students with Developmental Language Disorder (DLD) or Speech Sound Disorder (SSD) have access to speech therapy services either through the speech and language therapy services provided in special class settings by the HSE, or through the HSE’s primary care service.  For the 2025/26 school year there will be 64 special classes nationwide for children with a DLD or SSD. As the HSE provide speech and language therapy to students in these classes the opening and retention of such classes is contingent on the availability of HSE resources. For this reason, close engagement and coordination occurs among stakeholders at a local level.  Importantly, students with specific speech and language difficulties that are not enrolled in a special class may qualify for additional teaching support under the school's special education teaching support provision. 15,000 special education teachers have been provided to enable schools to achieve this. In practical terms, this means schools get a substantial additional teaching allocation to support children with special education needs who are in mainstream classes.  It is important to me and this Government that we build on the initiatives recently introduced to ensure that no matter where a child is enrolled, they have access to the required supports to enable them to achieve their educational goals.  As you are aware, the Educational Therapy Support Service (ETSS) was established in June 2024 within the National Council for Special Education (NCSE) and provides two strands of support, Regional Therapy and Sustained In-School Therapy to both mainstream and special schools.  After its establishment in 2024, the NCSE invited all schools in Dublin, Kildare and Wicklow to apply for two years of Sustained In-school Therapy Support, where they would have a Speech and Language Therapist and Occupational Therapist working with their school for two academic years. A robust prioritisation process ensued and initially 22 schools have been prioritised for NCSE Sustained In-school Support for 2024-2026.  Having engaged with colleagues in the NCSE, my understanding is the school referred to by the Deputy did not apply for this support at the time. However, teachers in the school are eligible to apply for regional therapy seminars with follow up support this year.  In addition the NCSE provide supports to schools through their Autism Advisor service. Schools can apply to access this support through the following link, which will go live in early August: Teacher Professional Learning – National Council for Special Education – Working to deliver a better special education service.  To note the Regional Therapy Support Service provides Teacher Professional Learning (TPL) with follow on/implementation support by NCSE therapists to build the capacity of schools to embed the learning from TPL into their teaching practice. Together with In-school coaching and co-facilitation of interventions, strategies and resources, with a focus on whole school (Tier 1) and targeted/school support levels (Tier 2) of a multi-tiered system of support.

Officials in my Department are engaging with relevant Departments and agencies on the design, timelines, alignment, integrated working and costings involved to deliver this ambitious programme of work.  It is anticipated that the Education Therapy Service (ETS) will commence in some special schools at a later stage in the 2025/26 school year. Further roll out of the service will occur on a phased basis with a wider roll-out in special schools commencing in the 2026/27 school year.  The development and delivery of this service will be informed by detailed engagement with our colleagues in the HSE and stakeholders and will build on the NCSE’s work previously completed through the Educational Therapy Support Service (ETSS).  The ETSS was established in June 2024 within the NCSE and initially comprised of 39 therapists, providing 2 strands of support, Regional Therapy and Sustained In-School Therapy to both mainstream and special schools.  Sustained in-school support (SIT) is provided to schools for a defined period of 18-24 months in line with the School Inclusion Model. 22 schools in the Eastern region are currently availing of this service. Schools in the Western regions, specifically in the counties of Limerick and Tipperary were invited to apply to the NCSE for Strand II sustained supports for the 2025/26 school year and schools will be confirmed next month.  Regional therapy support (RT) provides a national Therapy Teacher Training Service which involves teacher professional learning with in-school coaching and modelling in line with supports currently provided by the Educational Therapy Support Service within the NCSE. It is planned that these supports will be available nationally for the 2025/2026 school year.

        "answerText": " The Taoiseach  I propose to take Questions Nos. 18 to 34, inclusive, together.  The Cabinet committee on housing last met on Thursday 5 June and is due to meet again on Monday 21 July. The committee works to ensure a cross-Government approach to the implementation of our commitments in respect of housing policy. Housing supply has increased significantly over the past number of years, with almost 140,000 new homes delivered since the start of 2020. However, we know we need to do more. Housing is the single most urgent and important social and economic issue facing our country and one we are determined to get to grips with. The programme for Government sets out our ambition to build on the success of Housing for All to accelerate the delivery of homes.  Since entering office, we have allocated over €700 million to housing That is in addition to the €6 billion already allocated in budget 2025. This includes €450 million to build a further 3,000 social, affordable and cost rental homes and an additional €265 million to second-hand social housing acquisitions, bringing the total available for acquisitions in 2025 to €325 million. This increased funding, which will support tenant in situ acquisitions, will greatly help in preventing people falling into homelessness due to the sale of their rental homes.  We have also have brought forward a suite of measures to boost the delivery of homes. Among these, the revision of the national planning framework will enable local authorities to zone the significantly higher quantum of land needed to meet our ambition for housing delivery. We established the housing activation office in the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage. It will address barriers to the delivery of infrastructure projects needed to enable housing development. Additionally, the new infrastructure division in the Department of public expenditure will improve efficiency in delivering strategic infrastructure projects, critical to supporting us in scaling up housing delivery over the medium term.  We are moving at pace to reform our planning system, through the implementation of the landmark Planning and Development Act 2024. An Coimisiún Pleanála has been established and will focus on accelerating crucial planning decisions and reducing delays. The Government has also approved changes which will allow current holders of planning permissions for housing developments that have not yet commenced to apply for an extension of up to three years. This is about getting things moving and ensuring we do not lose out on the delivery of thousands of potential homes.  As a further measure to encourage the supply of much-needed homes, Government has published new guidelines which will strike a balance between ensuring apartment development meet the needs of society in terms of standards and quality, while promoting an increased level of delivery overall. In publishing these guidelines, we are taking decisive action without compromising on any essential regulations to ensure apartments are viable to build.  The Land Development Agency, LDA, has proven very successful in delivering social and affordable homes to date. We believe it can do even more, which is why we have agreed to an expansion to its remit. Earlier this month, we agreed to introduce a single-stage approval process for all social housing projects, up to a value of €200 million. This will cut red tape and support local authorities and approved housing bodies, AHBs, to increase and speed up the delivery of much-needed homes. The Government has also agreed reforms to rent pressure zones which, among other things, will strengthen the rights of tenants and will help to stimulate increased investment and development over the longer term. We are currently developing a new housing plan that will be aligned with the outcome of the national development plan, NDP, review process currently under way.  It is clear that we have many significant challenges, especially with the viability of apartment development. We will pursue every action possible and be creative in our thinking as we move to step up housing delivery. These decisions, which will be reflected in the revised plan, will allow us to drive forward and ensure momentum across all different areas of housing delivery over the lifetime of this Government. \n Deputy Conor Sheehan  At the behest of developers, the Government is committed to reducing apartment sizes and removing the minimum 5% community and cultural space. The Minister claimed this will reduce the cost of apartments by between €50,000 and €100,000, but those savings could only be achieved if every single measure were applied. We have had no detailed evidence for this claim, just an internal summary of the LDA's research. At the housing committee, the Minister told me the research will be published. When will the evidence for these drastic changes be provided in full? Will it be after the emergency planning legislation the Government is ramming through the Dáil and Seanad this week?  We were told a couple of months ago that the Planning and Development Act was a once-in-a-generation reform. Eight months later, however, the Government is rushing through amendments. In 20 years' time, when we are dealing with the consequences of large housing developments built without community or cultural space it will be too late. The plan to allow developers seek modification certificates to change existing planning permissions in line with the proposed new rules does not allow for any appeal to An Coimisiún Pleanála when such certificates are issued. Does the Taoiseach accept that this is likely to be a further recipe for judicial review? \n Deputy Darren O'Rourke  One of the big issues we face is acknowledged to be water infrastructure. I bring to the Taoiseach's attention water infrastructure challenges in County Meath, namely the water mains in Duleek, where there are repeated outages, including two in the past five days, and the water treatment capacity in Kells. Regarding Duleek, we met with Uisce Éireann a number of weeks ago. There is a commitment to act but things are proceeding far too slowly. We want to see those works advanced as quickly as possible. Attention may be diverted elsewhere to another major project in the county, which is welcome investment, but prioritisation must be given to the new mains in the town of Duleek. \n Deputy Ruth Coppinger  It is absolutely pathetic that the only thing the Government can offer young people to reduce the price of a home is to reduce its size. Going from 37 sq. m to 32 sq. m means these units will be smaller than a mobile home. Eight of them, apparently, would fit on a playing pitch. The estimated cost reduction this will bring about is between €28,000 and €40,000. It still will not make apartments affordable for any workers, including teachers, nurses or anyone else. It will not stop the exodus. In addition, the Government is loosening the regulations for builders in regard to light and the provision of windows. Yet again, it is a developer-led system.  Fingal County Council has announced it has stopped the tenant in situ scheme. The only possible means by which a TD can save any person from homelessness has now been removed. There is nothing else. What else can we do? If someone comes to any of us with a termination notice, having gone to the Residential Tenancies Board and Threshold, what else can we offer them? The Government has taken away the budget for the scheme. In Dublin City Council and Fingal County Council, in practically the whole of Dublin and most of the country, this has gone as an option. What is the Government offering people who have termination and evictions notice pending? \n Deputy Peadar Tóibín  According to information we in Aontú have received, 49% of people in emergency accommodation in the State have come from outside Ireland. That is a significant figure and there is no doubt it is putting pressure on the housing sector. Currently, 80,000 people net are coming to Ireland each year. If we include the population growth of the State, that is the equivalent of adding the population of Galway city to the country on an annual basis. Galway has a university, a university hospital, dozens of schools and tens of thousands of houses. The Government is simply not building that infrastructure on an annual basis.  I want to be clear that the lack of supply in housing is the Government's fault. It is not the responsibility of newcomers that supply is breaking down. I also want to be clear that we need to provide shelter for those fleeing war and violence. However, should not asylum seekers who are working here contribute to the cost of their accommodation? Is it fair that where two people in the same town are both working and earning the same, they do not both have to contribute to the cost of their accommodation? \n Deputy Séamus McGrath  In advance of the new housing plan in the coming month or so, I stress again the importance of increasing our affordable housing targets. There must be a rebalancing towards affordable housing in the plan's targets. I have made the point previously to the Taoiseach that there is a growing cohort of individuals and couples who need support but are not receiving any. Their incomes are above the social housing threshold but are well below what they need in terms of providing accommodation, whether by purchase or rental. They are individuals and couples who have incomes of up to €70,000 or €80,000 but who are not in a position to secure accommodation. They need support. We must meet in the middle in terms of those who qualify for social housing and those who need affordable housing supports. I reiterate the importance of increasing our affordable targets significantly in the new plan. I know the Taoiseach is committed to doing so ,but it is important to continue to highlight the point at every opportunity. \n Deputy Barry Heneghan  I am delighted to see the new private wires policy announced by the Government today. Will this be just for large-scale energy users like Amazon and the big data centres or will it be able to take eco-villages and small, eco- and sustainable projects away from the grid? We risk having a parallel grid that reduces costs for large corporations but does not really help the Irish people. Does the Taoiseach have any update on the North-South interconnector? \n Deputy Ruairí Ó Murchú  I have raised disability housing previously and the issue that has arisen with capital assistance scheme, CAS, funding. This was raised with me by St. John of God in reference to its approved housing body's dealings with the county councils in both Louth and Meath regarding the purchase of properties necessary for those with disabilities. They have been told by the local authorities that funding can no longer be given because the money is in the same bracket as the tenant in situ scheme and all those other schemes. This is creating a real issue. I do not know what the future is for a number of people whose rental contracts are coming to an end as landlords sell their properties. There is no longer the facility to purchase either those properties or alternative properties. We need to find some solution. \n Deputy Paul Murphy  The tenant in situ scheme is the only thing that lies between thousands of families and homelessness. The Government, by starving councils of funding for it, is, in effect, abolishing the scheme. It is incredible. Dublin City Council's programme is now officially over as it has run out of money. Fingal County Council is the same. Carlow County Council has now run out of money for its scheme. South Dublin County Council is just about to run out of money. I am sure other councils are only a matter of weeks or months away from being in the same place. South Dublin County Council still has 700 expressions of interest from families who are in this situation and for whom there will be no funding to prevent them going into homelessness. Focus Ireland put it correctly in saying, \"Government policy favours the vacant-possession sale on the market rather than the protection of the existing tenant\". Will the Taoiseach reverse this cruel policy, properly fund the tenant in situ scheme and prevent a new tidal wave of homelessness? \n Deputy Paul Lawless  There exists a huge chasm between Government rhetoric on housing and the reality locally. I draw the Taoiseach's attention to the housing situation in Mayo. The first home scheme, introduced in 2022, has delivered, on average, just six houses each year across the county. The affordable housing scheme, introduced in 2019, has delivered just five units, which is less than one per year. The cost-rental scheme in Mayo has delivered no housing units. There were hundreds of applications for the vacant property grant but just 83 payouts. Only four houses transitioned into the mortgage-to-rent scheme. The tenant in situ scheme has, in effect, ceased in Mayo, which is causing great difficulty.  This is the reality locally in Mayo. Five affordable housing units were delivered. Deputy Séamus McGrath mentioned affordable housing targets. In fact, there are no targets for affordable housing. That is the reality. The Government must introduce targets and apply some urgency in regard to the provision of affordable housing. Most of Mayo is not even considered for affordable housing. Claremorris, Ballina and Castlebar still have no affordable housing. \n An Leas-Cheann Comhairle  Will the Deputy please conclude? \n Deputy Paul Lawless  Housing delivery has collapsed under Fianna Fáil. This is a very serious issue. I ask the Taoiseach to please not deflect and to give us the reality. \n An Leas-Cheann Comhairle  Deputy Lawless, please resume your seat. \n Deputy Paul Lawless  Will he actually address this issue? \n The Taoiseach  Deputy Sheahan referred to the size of apartments and the change in the guidance and standardisation in terms of design and so on. That is not being done at the behest of developers. There is a well recognised and analysed viability gap in terms of the construction of apartments in cities and, indeed, across the country. It is well documented that there is a fundamental issue in terms of cost and viability. This is just one measure of a whole range of measures we have taken to try to bring private sector investment into the private rental market and into the apartment area, on top of the huge public sector investment in housing. At present, the main burden of investment in housing is being taken up by the State.  The planning Act introduced a major overhaul of the planning laws. An Coimisiún Pleanála has been established. A range of house and apartment types and sizes will be developed to meet the different needs of those seeking housing.  Not everyone has the same housing need. Positives will come out of this for certain parts of society that require smaller units. Houses will still be built. Two- and three-bedroom apartments will be built. It is a range of construction.  Deputy O'Rourke raised the issue of water infrastructure. I spoke to his party leader earlier on this. The Government is focusing on investment in public infrastructure, and water infrastructure in particular. I will pursue the issue in Duleek with the Minister and alert him that the Deputy raised it.  To respond to Deputy Coppinger, the help to buy and first home schemes have been very effective for new-time buyers. In terms of the tenant in situ scheme, a total of €325 million was allocated this year to local authorities the length and breadth of the country to buy second-hand properties. Tenant in situ social acquisitions are focused on tenants in receipt of HAP and RAS who receive a notice of termination. There are other mechanisms as well. This funding for second-hand acquisitions is part of a wider amount of €2 billion in total. These are supports for local authorities and AHBs to deliver new social homes. \n Deputy Ruth Coppinger  Why were the schemes stopped? \n The Taoiseach  A lot more social homes are built now than there were historically. The building of social homes is at a 40-year record, which does not get recognised at all. \n Deputy Paul Murphy  The population has doubled. \n The Taoiseach  Of those on the homeless lists, as I think that is what Deputy Tóibín was referring to, close to 50% are from the EU or the EEA. We have a growing population. The timelines as to when people come on to the emergency accommodation lists are a matter that needs to be examined in the context of the needs of people when they arrive in. The growing population has created new demands and pressures on our system. Of that, there is no doubt.  To respond to Deputy McGrath, while the Government is focused on affordable housing, it has to balance that with social housing. Getting more people out of the private rental sector and into social housing would take pressure off the private market. We are absolutely focused on supporting affordability and getting more affordable homes, particularly for those, as the Deputy said, who are above the social housing income threshold but do not have the financial resources available to purchase a home. That is a very significant group of people who need attention and supports.  With regard to Deputy Heneghan’s question, a statement was issued today on the private wires. A number of areas have been identified where this will be applied and legislation will be forthcoming from the Minister. That will be an opportunity to maybe broaden out some aspects and the breath of the proposal.  Deputy Ó Murchú raised CAS funding. There are a range of Government funding schemes available to housing, and there will continue to be. The national development plan will give a new capital framework for housing over the next five years. I have spoken about the tenant in situ scheme already.  Deputy Lawless referenced a whole range of schemes that he said were not delivering. I note that he said there were hundreds of applications in for the vacant grant and dereliction scheme. Obviously, grants take time to be paid down. It has been a popular scheme and very well received. It is proving to be effective. \n Deputy Paul Lawless  What about all the other schemes I mentioned? \n Deputy Peadar Tóibín  I asked a question in relation to accommodation and the different groups of people in Ireland. Some people are paying for accommodation and others are not. \n The Taoiseach  Is that in terms of----- \n Deputy Peadar Tóibín  It is in terms of asylum seekers. There is a question----- \n The Taoiseach  The Minister is pursuing that issue. \n Deputy Peadar Tóibín  So, will there be a change in the approach? \n The Taoiseach  Potentially. We have to wait to see the details of what will come forward from the Minister. ",

        "answerText": " The Taoiseach  I propose to take Questions Nos. 1 to 13, inclusive, together.  The Cabinet committee on children and education oversees the implementation of programme for Government commitments in the area of children and education. It receives detailed reports on identified policy areas such as child poverty and well-being and education. The membership of the Cabinet committee on children and education comprises the Taoiseach, the Tánaiste and Minister for foreign affairs and Defence, the Minister for Finance, the Minister for Public Expenditure, Infrastructure, Public Service Reform and Digitalisation, the Minister for Children, Disability, and Equality, the Minister for Health, the Minister for Social Protection, the Minister for Education and Youth and the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage.  The programme for Government contains many important commitments intended to improve the lives of all children, and especially those children who need our help most. One of the key areas relates to Government ambitions to reduce child poverty and enhance child well-being. The programme for Government commits to retaining the child poverty and well-being office in the Department of the Taoiseach to break down silos between Departments and drive delivery of measures aimed at reducing child poverty. The programme for Government also contains many commitments directly relevant to reducing child poverty and promoting child well-being. These commitments include setting an ambitious child poverty target, progressively increasing the child support payment, expanding eligibility for the fuel allowance to families in receipt of the working family payment and exploring a targeted child benefit payment.  Investment in education is central to this work to address child poverty and disadvantage. The Government’s vision for education is to deliver a world-class education system which breaks down barriers and ensures every child can achieve their full potential. That is why we remain committed to building on the work of the DEIS programme, which since 2006 has been operating to tackle educational disadvantage. The Cabinet committee meets quarterly and will meet for the second time shortly. \n Deputy Ivana Bacik  In terms of access to education for children with additional needs, I know Cara Darmody is speaking again today with Oireachtas Members about waiting lists for assessments for those with additional needs, and delays in accessing services and therapies. Will the Taoiseach confirm what extra capacity has been added to the system in recent months?  Second, I welcome the announcement that the Minister for education has today confirmed the establishment of a commission of investigation into historical sexual abuse in schools. I pay tribute to survivors like Mark and David Ryan, to Mary O'Toole for her scoping report and to all of those who came forward to share their experience of abuse and shine a light into the dark and shameful corner of our history of education.  I have two questions for the Taoiseach. First, what levers will he establish to ensure that religious institutions will pay their fair share of redress? We have a Labour Party Bill to remove legal obstacles to pursuing religious organisations and unincorporated associations. I will supply him with that, and he might consider taking it on board. Second, will he establish a parallel redress scheme for survivors, so they do not have to wait five years for the outcome of the report? \n Deputy Ryan O'Meara  I am sure the Taoiseach is aware of the teacher fee refund scheme. In 2025, it is aimed at assisting teachers with upskilling and paying for some of their course fees or examination fees. The Department of education has informed me that courses that fall under that with regard to professional development for teachers include tackling disadvantage, discrimination and equality and promoting well-being. I am aware of a career guidance counsellor in a secondary school who has done a counselling course and is not qualifying for the refund scheme. I believe we need to look beyond just the teaching environment to teachers in an example like that, where they are upskilling to be able to help their students, particularly in a counselling or career guidance capacity. When we talk about well-being and the benefits to students outside of a purely teaching and learning environment, I believe it would be a good thing to encourage our teachers and to assist them in that. I ask that the scheme be looked at to see if counselling can fall in under the teacher fee----- \n The Taoiseach  So, counselling does not fall under it. \n Deputy Ryan O'Meara  It does not fall under the teacher fee refund scheme. \n Deputy John Connolly  The Minister of State, Deputy Moynihan, informed the House last week that all teacher training courses will now include a period where the trainee teacher will work in a classroom for children with additional needs. That is welcome. However, I am concerned by the Department of education payroll review, which highlighted there were 1,800 vacant teaching positions within the system. Some 1,200 of the vacancies are in the primary sector. This correlates with the figures that the INTO has published, which show a significant number of vacant positions and schools having difficulty filling the roles. We have announced 400 additional classes for children with additional needs for this September. I have a great concern that schools will find it difficult to fill the roles associated with those new classes, which will provide schools with great challenges. Some measures have been taken to address the teacher shortage and the lack of teachers available, but the defining measure for me would be an increase in places in the colleges for teacher training. I know the University of Galway has indicated its desire to allow for a postgraduate programme for training primary teachers. I ask the Taoiseach to look at that. \n Deputy Ruairí Ó Murchú  I would like to know the Government's plans to ensure there is an appropriate class place for all kids, particularly those with additional needs. We have seen the issues that occur every year. It has already been stated that the issue of assessment of need has been brought up again by Cara Darmody. We know there is a big fear that legislative changes would take away the right people have with regard to delivery of the assessment of need within six months. Many parents have contacted me in the past while about the issue with school places and what school their children can go to. They have no surety because they have not been able to get an assessment of need. We have the issue of those with mild learning disabilities who fall between stools. There is no space for them. Certain schools will say their complex needs are too complex or not sufficiently complex to fall into this bracket. That is an issue we need to deal with. I bring up the issue of Tallanstown National School, where we had an assessment with regard to class places. There were 281 children in September. There are now 284, but it has resulted in a kid who has Down's syndrome possibly ending up in class of 36. It is a specific issue that needs to be looked at. \n Deputy Ruth Coppinger  Ireland is becoming the most expensive country in Europe to go to college. With the threatened withdrawal of the €1,000 assistance to parents, this will further be the case. Parents and students are making CAO decisions now about whether or not they can limit or pick cheaper courses or courses nearer to where they live, but the Taoiseach will not decide until July. Some 100,000 children are living in consistent poverty. College will become elitist once again, as it always was in decades past. The dropout rate among working class young people is 23%, compared with 11.5% in general. Full-time and part-time jobs are a necessity for working class youth going to college. Will the Taoiseach please give a commitment now, not in July as the cost-of-living crisis bites, that he will restore this? I welcome that there will be a protest outside Leinster House at 6 p.m. this evening, where young people will make their position crystal clear on this. \n Deputy Darren O'Rourke  I welcome the establishment of the commission of investigation into historical sex abuse in schools and the appointment of the chair, announced today. I have questions about the methodology, particularly as it relates to sampling and other areas. However, I ask about redress and pursuit of financial accountability. The Minister says that further work is being to examine the matter of financial redress, and how any future scheme could be funded. This is important to many survivors. It is viewed as a measure of accountability for those responsible for sexual abuse in schools and it is important to get it right. I totally agree with that. I brought amendments to the survivors Bill, which will go through the Dáil tomorrow, specifically to provide a time-framed six month options paper that the State would look at every option available to it to seek financial redress, particularly from religious institutions and orders.  Is there a detailed plan in place? What will the pursuit of financial options look like? \n Deputy Pádraig O'Sullivan  We all understand the importance of workforce planning, nowhere more so than in the area of children, education and health. I heard something concerning last week. It was that pay and numbers are yet to be agreed between the Department of Children, Disability and Equality and the HSE. TDs like myself come in here every week talking about delays for speech and language therapy and physiotherapy and about the delays inherent in the assessment of need system. If pay and numbers have not been agreed yet or the Department of children has not submitted something to the HSE, I am concerned we will be back here next year with further delays and posts not being filled. It is fundamental we get to the bottom of it immediately. \n Deputy Barry Heneghan  An tseachtain seo caite bhí Deputy Brabazon ag caint faoi Belgrove girls' school. Since then a decision was made by the diocese not to allow the addition of a privately sourced teacher for the school. I do not understand how religious entities can dictate public schools' resourcing of their teachers. Is there anything that can be done for Belgrove girls' school? \n Deputy Mary Lou McDonald  I raise again the critical shortage of special needs assistants and the devastating consequences of that in our schools. I will offer two examples from my constituency. Max Ryan is a nine-year-old student at St. Vincent's National School, Glasnevin. He has autism, global development delay, sensory issues, speech and language delay and separation anxiety. When Max entered junior infants, there was one other child in his class with additional needs and St. Vincent's had 2.5 SNA positions. Max is now going into fourth class, where there will be seven children with additional needs, and there are still only 2.5 SNA positions for the entire school. St. Catherine's Infant School in Cabra, like St. Vincent's, has engaged in the review by SENO for additional SNA provision but, like St. Vincent's, it has to date received nothing. The staff at St. Catherine's tell concerning stories of continual stress. They describe a situation that is hazardous for staff and traumatising for students. They are not exceptional. There are many schools in the same situation. They are doing incredible work. Max is just one of hundreds of young children being let down every single day. When will SNA provision truly match the need in our schools? \n Deputy Conor D. McGuinness  School secretaries and caretakers have served their schools and communities for years and, in many cases, decades. They are the glue that holds our school system together and they do not want to go on strike. They just want fairness when it comes to pay and conditions but this Government has shown no such fairness. There has been zero engagement. Fórsa trade union has made numerous offers to talk and every one has been ignored. Forced into a corner, Fórsa has written to 2,000 schools to give formal notice of indefinite strike action at the end of August. These workers seek pay justice and pension parity and a basic recognition of their contribution. Instead of action, they have been met with silence. The Ministers, Deputies McEntee and Chambers, have failed utterly to respond despite knowing what is at stake. Will the Taoiseach intervene, direct his Ministers to engage for Fórsa and take immediate steps to deliver a fair and just resolution, or will he allow this strike to proceed? \n The Taoiseach  There is quite a substantial number of questions there. Deputy Bacik raised the establishment of the commission of inquiry. \n Deputy Ivana Bacik  I welcome it. \n The Taoiseach  I pay tribute to Mark and David Ryan for what they did in providing a catalyst for the establishment of this inquiry and the scoping inquiry before it. It would be unprecedented to have a redress scheme in advance of a commission of inquiry. \n Deputy Ivana Bacik  In parallel. \n The Taoiseach  That is difficult as well. One has to make an assessment of what is happening. That said, the Department is working on this. Fundamentally, those who have committed the crimes and those responsible for them should pay. That is the religious orders, in particular. A significant degree of work is under way in the Department to identify various scenarios. In previous times, the State went first and got roundly criticised by everyone in this House. I am particularly thinking of the institutional abuse case, where the State got criticised even though it moved quickly to avoid people having to go through the courts and provided a redress scheme for survivors of institutions. In this instance, many of the orders have resources that they can allocate. In any event, that work is under way. As well as setting up the inquiry, the Minister and her Department are working on that issue.  Deputy O'Meara raised the teacher refund scheme. I will talk to the Minister in that regard. I think that is an omission. Counsellors in schools are teachers, predominantly.  Deputy Connolly spoke of teacher vacancies. I want to make the point to everyone in the House that the annual education indicators report for the 2023-2024 school year was presented to Cabinet today. It is published jointly by the Department of Education and Youth and the Department of Children, Disability and Equality. We have more teachers than we ever had. Total teaching posts rose to 76,223 in the last year; that is up from 69,221 in 2020. The pupil-teacher ratio is declining. Class sizes have decreased from 23.3 to 22.5 since 2020. Dividing the number of teachers in schools by pupils gives extraordinary outcomes. The pupil-teacher ratio is 12.8 in a primary school, down from 14.5. It is 12.2 in post primary. That is dividing the number of teachers crudely into the number of pupils. That has created challenges as we seek to expand special classes this year. Some 400 special classes have been confirmed. We need to assess it again. There are particular issues in particular locations with housing and so on but the overall story when you stand back and look at what has happened in recent years is more and more people have come into teaching. Listening to some of the commentary, one would imagine it was going in the opposite direction. There needs to be balance and perspective in the debate. I just thought I would make that observation. I will come back to the Deputy on recruitment of teachers for the 400 extra classes.  Deputy Ó Murchú raised class places for children with special educational needs. Some significant work has been undertaken by the Minister with responsibility for special education, Deputy Moynihan, and the Minister for education, Deputy McEntee. Both are working hard on special education and securing places for children in advance of the school year. They have made good progress. Some schools will need structural work. Some may not be ready in September but will certainly be ready at some stage in the next school year. We are doing everything we can to ensure that in future years planning starts earlier. Trials are being conducted on a common application system to streamline that. When we provide additional places, it is important they are for children on the waiting list, primarily. That is why they are being secured and the NCSE is working hard on that.  In response to Deputy Coppinger, what is significant in terms of third level education is that we are now third in the OECD for tertiary attainment. In Ireland 54% of adults hold a third level qualification which is well above the European Union average of 35%. The national access plan, SUSI grants and the fund for students with disabilities have significantly widened access for disadvantaged, disabled and under-represented students. That is a story of progress that does not get highlighted at all. The share of higher education entrants with a disability rose from 12.4% in 2022 to 14.7% in 2024. Over 14,800 learners with disabilities are now in further education. A Fianna Fáil Minister introduced DEIS more than two decades ago. Norma Foley in the last Government dramatically expanded it.  The good news is that progression from DEIS schools to further and higher education has risen to 64%, closing the gap with the non-DEIS schools, which stands at 80%. These are real achievements at third level and we should not lose sight of them in all the other commentary. I dealt with that issue earlier. The budget and the Estimates will deal with the provision for third level education for the next academic year.  I think I answered Deputy O'Rourke's question on the commission of investigation, in that the Minister and the Department officials are working on that issue. They have a bit more work to do. They will come back to the House when that is completed.  I am not quite clear what Deputy O'Sullivan was referring to in respect of the Department of children and equality not reconciling pay and numbers between the HSE and the Department of children. I will check that with the Minister for children and come back to the Deputy.  On Deputy's Heneghan's issue, is it that the school has privately resourced a teacher? \n Deputy Barry Heneghan  It is looking to privately resource one. \n The Taoiseach  I will have to look into the background of that and come back to the Deputy with an answer from the Minister. On Deputy McDonald's question about special needs assistants, the numbers are growing exponentially. \n Deputy Mary Lou McDonald  Not at St. Vincent's. \n The Taoiseach  I do not know what is happening with individual schools' allocations but the numbers are growing exponentially. We are close to 23,000 SNAs now. It has been a story of increases and increases. I acknowledge the numbers of children who have been identified with a disability has increased as well. It was quite high in the most recent census, much higher than the previous census. Demand is rising but so are the allocations. \n Deputy Mary Lou McDonald  Not for those schools. \n The Taoiseach  I do not have the specifics of those schools and the Deputy has identified them----- \n Deputy Mary Lou McDonald  I have given them. I will write to the Taoiseach. \n The Taoiseach  ----but maybe the Minister can respond to the specifics of that.  On Deputy McGuinness' question, as he knows there had been a previous industrial relations issue about secretaries' salaries. That was settled with Fórsa trade union. The term used at the time was full and final settlement. I acknowledge pensions is a separate issue. First of all, school secretaries are an extremely important part of the entire staff of a school and are key. I welcome the fact we were able to arrive at a settlement on the pay front. The Minister is keeping this issue under review. Obviously, this is an issue that at some stage has to get into a process to get resolved. ",

        "answerText": " The Taoiseach  I propose to take Questions Nos. 10 to 20, inclusive, together.  The Cabinet committee on health last met on 4 June 2025 and is due to meet again on 17 July 2025. It oversees implementation of programme for Government commitments in relation to health, receives detailed reports on identified policy areas and considers health reforms, including Sláintecare and the reform of public health and health system preparedness for future health threats. It also receives reports on programme for Government commitments in the areas of mental health and drugs policy.  Path to Universal Healthcare: Sláintecare & Programme for Government 2025+, our latest Sláintecare strategy published last month, aims to forge the way towards accessible, affordable, high-quality, healthcare for the people when they need it and where they need it. We will continue to build our workforce through the recruitment of key roles, retention measures and additional college places for key disciplines. We have capacity to hire a further 6,105 whole-time equivalents, WTEs, to Department of Health-funded posts during the remainder of 2025. We will deliver faster access to care. Funding of €420 million has been allocated for the waiting list action plan 2025. We will continue to review capacity in emergency departments. We will increase the number of public-only consultants in emergency medicine and ensure more senior staff are rostered in emergency departments during weekends and public holidays for better decision-making. The construction of 297 new and replacement acute beds is expected to be completed in 2025. The surgical hub for south Dublin opened in February this year with additional hubs becoming operational later in 2025 and 2026. We will continue to invest in a healthier future with a national physical activity framework and action plan due to be published in 2025 and a new obesity policy and action plan to be published in 2026.  We are launching a new era of innovation and digital transformation in health. The national patient app has been rolled out, with additional features to be added later in the year. The national shared care record will be developed throughout the year and the electronic health record will also be progressed. Additional projects which are key to the increased digitalisation of the health service include a national system for electronic prescribing and remote health monitoring and virtual care solutions. In mental health we will continue to build the mental health workforce and infrastructure and support community-based services. In older people’s services we will support people to live at home within their communities and strengthen the nursing home sector. The welfare of residents is at the forefront of Government’s concerns. The forthcoming national policy on adult safeguarding for the health and social care sector, which is a programme for Government commitment, will set out how existing protections will be strengthened. This policy is near finalisation and will be brought to Government shortly.  All these commitments build on the investment and reforms undertaken over the past number of years, including the delivery of approximately 1,282 acute beds, an increased workforce of close to 30,000 since the start of 2020, more affordable healthcare through reductions in the drugs payment scheme threshold to €80, removal of hospital inpatient charges, extension of the eligibility for free GP cards for all children under eight and to all earning no more than the median income, State-funded IVF, free contraception for women aged 17 to 35 and free access to HRT therapies. From September 2021 to April 2025, there has been an almost 60% reduction in the number of people waiting longer than 12 months. Care is being delivered closer to home in 180 primary care centres through 96 community health networks, 27 community specialist teams for older persons and 26 community specialist teams for chronic disease are now operational. Some 23 community intervention teams are operational, with national coverage secured. The new regional structures within the HSE have been established with six new health regions and 20 integrated health areas. Health and social care services are planned and delivered around the specific needs of local populations and this leads to better co-ordination of care and access to services. We will continue to invest and reform. \n Deputy Marie Sherlock  The Cabinet today approved the patient safety (licensing) Bill. It is long-awaited legislation and one we very much welcome, but will there be minimum staffing numbers in that critical legislation? The INMO has been campaigning on this for a long time.  On cervical cancer, I hosted the 221+ group last week. We saw reports at the weekend that cervical screening is still failing women. Three women have died of cancer and seven more have a positive diagnosis after smear tests were allegedly negligently misread between 2018 and 2021. I ask the Taoiseach about CervicalCheck and the actions the Cabinet health committee is taking to ensure it can provide assurance we can all be confident in the work it is undertaking. \n Deputy Martin Daly  Would it be possible for the Minister for Health and her Department and the Government to reconsider their stance on the shingles vaccine given recent studies that show the administration of shingles vaccine in the elderly population has the added benefit of the reduction of the onset of dementia by about 20%? It is a significant additional piece of data published in Nature magazine and based on a study of the introduction of the vaccine in Wales. The shingles vaccine is now offered to all people aged over 60 in the UK, as well as in a number of other jurisdictions. This bit of data improves the cost-benefit analysis of the introduction of a shingles vaccine programme for elderly people. \n Deputy Darren O'Rourke  Last week, Children's Health Ireland confirmed just 105 appointments have been offered so far to the children potentially affected by the scandal of unnecessary hip surgeries. Only 60 people have been seen so far out of a total of 2,259 children who had hip surgery since 2010 at Children's Health Ireland or the National Orthopaedic Hospital, Cappagh. At this rate it will take more than 20 years for every child to be assessed.  To make matters worse, CHI has also confirmed that it is only conducting a once-off review to assess complications only and determine current clinical state. That means it will not provide answers to the 2,259 families on the question of whether their child's surgery was necessary in the first place. It will not provide answers to the question of whether those children were harmed or wronged by malpractice. There will be no transparency, no honesty and no accountability. Will the Government ensure that Children's Health Ireland gets to the real facts for these children and tells them straight whether their surgery was necessary? \n Deputy Ruth Coppinger  On the issue of children's health in this country, the Taoiseach gave a glowing introduction, but we have the ongoing scandals at CHI. The latest is no disclosure to parents of the failure of CHI to operate or give treatment to boys with undescended testes leading to potential infertility and cancer issues. Yet, that did not meet the threshold for disclosure. I do not have time in this interaction but does he agree that this is now systemic? It is not one thing here and one thing there. One of the issues parents have raised is the idea of a partial ratified independent scrutiny-type investigation prism where parents would have monitoring and oversight of experts because we will keep continuing down this road and eventually have to concede a public inquiry.  The Taoiseach also mentioned in his introduction the announcement of a move to a seven-day operation of the health service. That is all well and good, but there is a shortage of 1,000 beds. There is a shortage of thousands of staff. Staff will be spread over seven days, potentially leading to more mistakes, more bad treatment and more people lying on trolleys. \n Deputy Máire Devine  In my first six months as a TD, I have been asked to intervene in four emergency mental health cases for constituents in Dublin South-Central. Three were for severe eating disorders where the patient's family feared for their survival if appropriate treatment was not provided immediately. The fourth acute patient simply sought a second medical opinion but was discouraged by the HSE at every stage. In all cases, the patients and their families felt they were not being heard by treating physicians and the scenarios were so dire I had to involve a Minister of State's office to procure emergency mental health attention and specialist assessment for the patients. Patients with life-threatening illnesses are having difficulty obtaining appropriate care. I am asking for an update on specialists in the eating disorder section. Why is the HSE not adhering to its national consent policy and established case law to respect a patient's choice to seek a second opinion? \n Deputy Conor D. McGuinness  Almost ten years ago the Taoiseach stood outside University Hospital Waterford with a billboard promising 24-7 cardiac care for Waterford and the south-east. Ten years on, the people of the south-east are still waiting. Cabinet approval was announced two months ago but since then there has been no detailed plan, timeline or staffing strategy. Announcements are cheap and it is delivery that matters. We have lost years waiting for that announcement and that go ahead. Without urgent action, lives remain at risk in Waterford and the wider south-east. Will the Taoiseach confirm if recruitment is completed, and when we will see a full implementation plan with timelines, staffing targets and guaranteed delivery of 24-7 cardiac care at UHW? \n Deputy Pádraig O'Sullivan  The Mazars report stated that the HSE has not been implementing the legal timelines for the reimbursement of medicines. I can refer to at least four studies commissioned in the past year that show legal timelines are not being adhered to. In February last year, the Irish Pharmaceutical Healthcare Association published a paper showing that 86% of all reimbursements did not adhere to the 180-day timeline as outlined in the legislation. The Taoiseach knows I am a long-term advocate for reform in this regard. I am asking that the HSE, its affiliates on the drugs group, the National Centre for Pharmacoeconomics, NCPE, and others just implement the current legislation. Patients with unmet needs are waiting years for decisions in Ireland while the majority of our European counterparts wait months. Does the Taoiseach think, as per those reports, that the HSE and the NCPE are adhering to those guidelines? It is important that he clarifies that today. \n Deputy Michael Cahill  The national immunisation programme should include a vaccination for shingles free of charge for all our citizens. A vaccine to prevent shingles would be of great benefit to the entire population but would particularly benefit older people who are more susceptible to viral disease. Shingles can be quite painful and debilitating and these effects are more pronounced in older people. The costs would be beyond the budget of many and as a public health issue, a nationwide free vaccination scheme would benefit the entire population. Given that it is available free of charge in Northern Ireland, it should also be available here. We must support and protect our most vulnerable, those with health issues and those getting on in years. I urge the Taoiseach to liaise with the Ministers for Health, Finance and public expenditure to introduce this vaccine as soon as possible. \n Deputy Ruairí Ó Murchú  I pay tribute to 15-year-old Kofi Owusu from Dundalk, County Louth, who lost his life after getting into difficulty swimming in Laytown, County Meath, last Friday. Our condolences go to his family, his friends and to the wider community. We have all heard the tributes from Redeemer Celtic and Tomás Sharkey in Coláiste Chú Chulainn, the school he attended. We have heard of his diligence, his leadership qualities and his friendship. A huge hole has been left by this. We are talking about somebody who was a spectacular footballer and basketball player but he sounded like an all-round really great kid. This happened just a couple of days following the death of Isobel McCluskey and highlights the dangers of swimming and water. We hope we have a good summer but there is an absolute necessity that we do all we can with regard to information because we have had too many of these tragedies across Ireland. \n Deputy Paul Murphy  I want to raise the poor state of healthcare for those suffering with allergies in this country. Many parents are forced to spend huge amounts to travel abroad to get their children the treatment they need. I spoke to a woman a few months ago who had to go to America for six weeks. She had to pay €8,000 for treatment. She was also out of work for six weeks and had to pay for accommodation. That is not unusual. A lot of families go to Britain or America to get oral immunotherapy in particular. This can take the form of a tablet like Palforzia, which contains a tiny amount of peanuts for those suffering from peanut allergies, or oral immunotherapy where people, mostly children, are consuming tiny amounts of the product they are allergic to in controlled environments and they build up resistance over time to have a less severe allergic reaction. The problem is that these are not available within the Irish health system and are not even covered by the treatment abroad scheme. Does the Taoiseach agree we need a multiyear national allergy strategy and that we need to offer oral immunotherapy in this country? \n Deputy John Connolly  The healthcare sector is one sector of our public service that relies heavily on attracting and recruiting practitioners and staff internationally. In 2024, 6,000 of the 17,000 critical skills permits provided by the State were in the health or social work sectors, 5,031 of which were for nursing staff. In 2023, the OECD said that 54% of nurses working in Ireland had trained in other jurisdictions. The equivalent figure in the UK was 18%. I harbour a guess that many of them are probably Irish. I arrive at two conclusions from this. First, we are not training an adequate number of healthcare professionals, in particular practitioners and particularly nurses. Second, nurses particularly are choosing post qualification to seek opportunities in countries other than Ireland. Both of these conclusions need to be interrogated. \n The Taoiseach  I will start with Deputy Sherlock's questions on the patient safety (licensing) Bill and cervical cancer screening. The patient safety (licensing) Bill came through Cabinet today and the Minister can go through the details with the Deputy in due course, in terms of specifics on safe numbers, safe staffing and so forth. A lot of it has been introduced without legislation in accordance with agreements. The Minister will continue to resource the cervical cancer programme and other cancer screening programmes. It is important to say screening programmes are the first stage. They are population screening programmes designed to intervene early and identify but they are not the ultimate in diagnostic approaches. If people present with symptoms, they may need more detailed diagnostic assessment. We have to get the balance right. The public needs very clear information on screening programmes and what they can achieve and on the importance of always consulting a GP or consultant. That is extremely important because there are limits to screening programmes. There are calls to expand the number of screening programmes in different areas. We have made a lot of progress on cervical cancer screening because of new technology and new methodology but we are open to improving further and engaging with the various groupings to see what issues have been identified as problematic and how they can be improved. I will talk to the Minister for Health about that.  Deputies Daly and Cahill raised the shingles vaccine. My understanding is it is a significantly expensive vaccine. I am struck by the research Deputy Daly cited regarding its impact on the risk of dementia. A figure as high as 20% is very significant. He said the research was published recently in Nature so I will talk to the Minister for Health about that. Generally, I am a supporter of vaccines. As a public health intervention, they have been extremely effective in the history of this country. People are not dying of what people died from 100 years ago any more, primarily because of the successful introduction of vaccines to deal with a lot of infectious diseases. That is easily forgotten in modern discourse and debates. The Covid-19 vaccine was essential to society coming back to some degree of normality. Without that vaccine, we would still be in deep trouble. It is important to state that. I will go to the Minister in respect of that.  Deputy O'Rourke raised CHI. Every family must be told whether their child required surgery. There has to be complete transparency from CHI in respect of that. There has to be diligent follow-up with all concerned, as it declared. We will ensure that happens. I will talk to the Minister on engaging with CHI on that issue.  Deputy Coppinger raised CHI, again, and the issue relating to young boys. That is a very serious issue, which needs to be addressed transparently and comprehensively by CHI. The HSE and the Department of Health should be involved in respect of that issue. The Dickson report from 2017 on urology services in CHI proposed the consolidation of all paediatric urology services into a single, cohesive centre, the establishment of a multidisciplinary urology team and so forth. That key issue needs to be further examined in light of that report. The issues the Deputy has identified should have been disclosed earlier.  That is a very good agreement between the HSE and the unions. Healthcare staff numbers have risen enormously in the past four to five years with 30,000 extra. We cannot keep on saying, \"Let's get another couple of thousand.\" There has to be a balance. \n Deputy Ruth Coppinger  There is a huge shortage. \n The Taoiseach  There is not a huge shortage. Thousands of people have been recruited. Let us be straight about it. The seven-day use of hospitals is something that should happen. It should not be dependent on more and more staff. The assets were not being used. Expensive diagnostic equipment was not being used optimally and the hospitals themselves were not being used optimally when there were five-day, nine-to-five services. Productivity matters, as do new devices and new technology. We need a broader approach to get better value for money. We have invested hugely in health and that needs to be acknowledged. Productivity and value for money are also factors. We are recruiting a further 6,000 in 2025, in addition to the 30,000 that have been recruited. I accept the population is increasing and that will create demand for services. It has created a lot of demand for health services. The population is ageing, which is creating further demand for the health service. That deal is a good one and will lead to greater productivity in hospitals and health services.  On mental health issues, the Minister of State, Deputy Butler, has been doing significant work on eating disorders. Deputy Devine could talk to her about the specifics of the cases she has raised. We need more investment in eating disorder centres but we have had some. A lot of progress has been made in that respect.  Deputy McGuinness raised cardiac care. Much progress has been made in the past five years in respect of cath lab investment in Waterford. It has been incrementally building up. There has been quite good investment in the past two to three years. Now we will complete that in terms of 24-7 provision. That is a Government decision that has been taken and that will happen. Recruitment in healthcare takes time. It does not happen within two months but it will happen and that will be developed, as committed to by Government.  Deputy O'Sullivan raised the reimbursement of medication. More progress needs to be made on the reimbursement of medicines. Quite a lot has been made. I met IPHA representatives who represent the pharmaceutical industry here. Understandably, it is promoting this but when I questioned IPHA members two years ago, they were more or less saying they had a good enough relationship with the national pharmacovigilance unit. As a country with a strong concentration of pharmaceutical companies and which produces some of the most effective medicines in the world, we should have a modern, up-to-date reimbursement process. However, that has implications for public expenditure. Progress has been made but we need to make more, and we need to meet the standards and European norms.  Deputy Cahill raised the shingles vaccine. I do not doubt the benefits but the expenditure would be significant. We need to bear that in mind.  I join Deputy Ó Murchú in offering sympathy to Kofi's family. It is heartbreaking that any young person so talented and with so much to offer in life should die in such circumstances. The Deputy mentioned Isobel McCluskey as well. The national emergency forum - there is a more precise title for it - did a lot of work on water safety in terms of swimming in rivers and in the sea over the past two years, and on prevention. One of the most effective interventions in healthcare is prevention. Public health messaging on accidents is a key dimension of that and is a factor in injuries and deaths. Our sympathies go to all in the community and the families affected.  Deputy Murphy raised the issue of allergies. We have multidisciplinary teams involved in allergy.  I defer to medical and professional advice within our own system on the provision of oral immunology therapy. It is a complex area that takes a lot of building up of immunology. A lot of children have spent a lot of time with consultants so I am slightly worried. I am not an expert on this but I defer to proper, professional advice as to when such medicines could be accessed or used. I say to everybody out there to consult their GP and consultant in respect of the utilisation of any therapies in that regard.  Deputy Connolly mentioned nursing and 6,000 critical skills permits, of which I think he said 5,000 were in nursing. There are two ways of looking at it. A lot of young graduates travel and have been travelling for a long time in the medical world. There may be an issue of retention. Some come back to work in Ireland later on and there are huge specialties available to nurses in Ireland. There are huge programmes, including postgraduate programmes and specialist programmes. We have developed the likes of intensive care nursing and cardiac nursing very well with native talent. There has been phenomenal change in nursing in Ireland over the last 20 years, from the degree programmes to the postgraduate programmes. However, there is an issue of retention and retraining people and we have to be more innovative in terms of how we do that into the future and we then attract nurses from other jurisdictions into the country. \n An Cathaoirleach Gníomhach (Deputy Mark Wall)  I thank the Taoiseach. I am informed the time for Taoiseach's Questions has finished so we will move on to statements on nursing homes and care for older persons. We will wait for the Minister of State to join us. \n Deputy Peadar Tóibín  In fairness, Chair, that is not fair. A lot of us were waiting here for questions and the Taoiseach took an inordinate amount of time to whitter on with those answers. Do the same rules not apply to the Taoiseach as apply to everybody else in this House? \n Deputy Conor D. McGuinness  While we are waiting for the Minister of State, Chair. \n An Cathaoirleach Gníomhach (Deputy Mark Wall)  That is what I have been informed by the clerk. \n Deputy Ruairí Ó Murchú  We might continue, Chair. The Taoiseach has signalled a willingness to continue. \n The Taoiseach  That is very unfair of Deputy Tóibín. He arrived late himself. \n Deputy Peadar Tóibín  In fairness, we get a minute. It is timed and we are told to stop. There was no umpiring of the time on this occasion at all. \n The Taoiseach  I am normally very generous, Deputy. Come on. I am normally very generous. \n An Cathaoirleach Gníomhach (Deputy Mark Wall)  I am told the rule is 45 minutes. The time is up so I have to proceed to the next item on the Order of Business, which is statements. \n Deputy Peadar Tóibín  Normally, the time is split in a certain way to make sure the three groupings are taken in the 45 minutes. \n The Taoiseach  In the first grouping, there were many questions answered. I accept there are several questions in the third grouping. A lot of people did not turn up at all at the beginning. It cuts each way. All of the Deputies wanted this session------ \n Deputy Peadar Tóibín  It should cut both ways. That is the point I am trying to make. \n The Taoiseach  -----but the number of Deputies who were absent at the beginning of this session left me surprised. ",

The use of the Department's Term Maintenance Framework assists in ensuring lead in periods for procurement of accommodation are minimised to the greatest extent possible and helps ease the administrative workload for school authorities in relation to the management and delivery of projects.  Kerrigan Sheanon Newman Project Management (KSN) has been appointed, from my Department’s Framework, to design and tender the project and oversee all elements of construction.  The use of the parish hall is part of the project and a full statutory application for change of use was required to facilitate the use of the parish hall as part of the project. A decision to grant planning permission for change of use of the Parish Hall was received on Friday the 13th June 2025. A four-week appeal period has now commenced, if no appeal is lodged works on the project can begin week commencing the 14th July 2025. The tentative timeline for completion of the works is November 2025. The school authority in conjunction with the Department and the National Council for Special Education is working through contingency planning for the start of the school year.  The school authority are aware of the current programme timelines and the project managers will keep them updated regularly as the project progresses.  My department is working to ensure the expedited delivery of all required accommodation solutions for special classes, and it is expected that the required accommodation will be in place for the start of the school year in the vast majority of cases. Where this is not the case, the NCSE and my department will support the school to put appropriate contingency arrangements in place to ensure that these classes can open while permanent accommodation is being provided.

        "answerText": " The Taoiseach  I propose to take Questions Nos. 1 to 8, inclusive, together.  The Cabinet committee on climate action, environment and energy oversees the implementation of the programme for Government commitments on the environment, climate action, energy and emergency planning. It considers the wide range of issues that require action in Ireland's transition to a low-carbon, climate resilient and sustainable future: a future in which we take full advantage of the renewable energy potential that we possess. It also oversees implementation of the climate action plan. The committee meets quarterly. The first meeting took place on 7 April and the next meeting is scheduled to take place in July.  The Department of the Taoiseach tracks the delivery of actions committed to in the climate action plan and publishes quarterly progress reports. Following approval by the Government, progress reports and detailed tables of actions completed and delayed are published online. The progress report for quarters 3 and 4 of the Climate Action Plan 2024 was published in April and shows an overall implementation rate for the year of 64%, with 80 of 125 actions completed in 2024. Significant milestones achieved in the period include: nearly €3.8 million in grant funding for 15 projects in Ireland's midlands as part of the EU's just transition fund; the launch of 65 Connecting Ireland transport routes; the approval of the terms and conditions of Ireland's second offshore wind auction; the installation of solar panels in more than 1,000 schools; the establishment of a national certification-accreditation system for eco-driving courses in the haulage sector; the publication of an electricity demand-side strategy; and the incentivisation of large energy users to participate in flexible demand initiatives.  Actions that were not completed during 2024 have been carried forward to be reported upon, together with the new actions agreed as part of Climate Action Plan 2025. \n Deputy Ivana Bacik  There is a real concern that we will be simply unable to meet our targets. Figures from the CSO, published last week, show 22% of Ireland's electricity in 2024 was consumed by data centres and that demand had increased by 10% in one year. We recently saw the Secretary General of the Department of the environment raising concerns about the potential conflict between expanding data centres and meeting housing needs, particularly due to climate targets and energy demands. It seems that Ireland must now import significant amounts of electricity to power these data centres. The demand from data centres is driving increased natural gas usage in Ireland and soaking up any additional renewable energy as it comes online.  How do we square the circle? Everyone accepts that we must ensure the retention of jobs and that we have become a digital leader, but how can we sustain this level of growth? Is it credible for Ireland to keep allowing so many data centres to locate here? We, and others, have called for moratoriums until we can see how to square the circle. \n An Ceann Comhairle  I thank the Deputy. \n Deputy Ivana Bacik  There are some indications that, for example, data centres themselves can drive change and ensure they become net zero but we need the Government to take the lead on this. \n An Ceann Comhairle  I thank the Deputy. I call Deputy Coppinger. \n Deputy Ivana Bacik  We are not seeing that happen currently. \n Deputy Ruth Coppinger  Is this a government of climate deniers? Has the Government just given up any pretence of trying to deal with the climate crisis? We are due to reach a reduction in greenhouse gas emissions of 23% rather than 51%. We are not going to reach one third of the targets for agriculture. We have the worst emissions in Europe. We are now the dirty country of Europe.  Half of Dublin's electricity is going on data centres. One of the Ministers of State, Deputy Michael Healy-Rae, proposed to put forests on peatland – something that has been called environmental vandalism by an academic. The dairy herd has increased in the past ten years by 53%. All of the things that are necessary to address climate change are not being done. It seems that it is just a case of let rip. The super rich globally have allowed investment by banks in fossil fuels to increase. Some of the Taoiseach's own Deputies are profiting from AI, but he cannot continue to worship AI and data centres at the expense of the environment. \n Deputy Malcolm Byrne  Up to 25% of Ireland's coastline is facing the serious problem of coastal erosion and the proportion in counties Wicklow and Wexford is higher. The Taoiseach will be aware that I represent an area that stretches from Brittas Bay to Morriscastle. We have some of the finest beaches in the country, but many of them, most notably Courtown and Kilmichael, are in serious danger.  We need to look at addressing this from a climate point of view and at beach replenishment. There is the threat to adjoining lands and infrastructure, nesting areas and coastal biodiversity. We can learn from other countries such as the Netherlands. Of concern to me as well is that the Department of Climate, Energy and the Environment's own statistics show that, between 2017 and 2024, the number of homes at risk in our coastal areas grew from 1,445 to 2,279. I ask that this issue be a priority. \n Deputy Naoise Ó Cearúil  The EPA recently identified 115 risks to Ireland from climate change. These range from disruption to Ireland’s energy system, as we saw recently with Storm Éowyn, to damage to Ireland’s built environment from extreme wind and weather events. Will the Taoiseach clarify if the Cabinet committee on climate action will address this report and provide updates on it? Furthermore, we have heard talk of data centres, etc. The private wires Bill needs to be prioritised and be brought before the House as soon as possible. \n Deputy Shane Moynihan  Core to our transition to a green economy will be ensuring that the workforce has the skills necessary to enable it. A recent SOLAS report shows that, of all the jobs in the workforce, 75% require some sort of green or sustainability-based skill and that there are more than 400,000 people in employment in green occupations. Green jobs are an area of growth for the future, especially as Ireland embraces its position as a leader in climate action and developing the renewable energy industries that underpin it. Will the Taoiseach outline to the House the proposals and progress the Government is making on embedding green skilling, not only in the green and renewable sector, but across the economy to ensure we transition to a green workforce and identify that sweet spot for Ireland between the green and digital revolutions? \n Deputy Mary Lou McDonald  This Thursday, workers in Bord na Móna Recycling, the country’s only remaining publicly owned domestic waste collection service, will go on strike. The company's recycling arm is being sold off to a privately owned company called KWD Recycling. This State sell-off not only jeopardises workers' terms and conditions, but also makes a mockery of the Government's consultation on reform of Ireland’s approach to waste management. If the Government is open to changing the system, why on earth would it sell off the last publicly owned body involved in the sector?  The privatised approach has not worked; it is not fit for purpose. It has hampered efficiency, driven up emissions and exacerbated local traffic congestion, and prices keep going up. I see at first hand how badly served this city is, including my own constituency of Dublin Central, by this approach. Last year, Dublin City Council spent €71 million on street cleaning, involving collecting 3,000 tonnes of illegally dumped bags, providing recycling facilities, landfill recovery and waste enforcement. The system is broken and needs to be fixed. Bord na Móna drove economic development in the midlands. It was supposed to be central to the just transition to a green economy. Rather than protect the State’s involvement in this, why has Bord na Móna had its assets stripped? When will we have again a publicly controlled, affordable and sustainable waste management system in Ireland? \n Deputy Barry Heneghan  I heard a Member of this House say that this Government is anti-climate change measures. I ask her to look at the programme for Government. I am a recently qualified mechanical engineer who helped to contribute to the programme for Government. Another Member spoken about the private wires Bill. Yes, 50% of Dublin's electricity is used by data centres, but what do the Members propose we do? Are they just going to whinge and whine? I propose we bring in the private wire legislation as quickly as possible and make the data centres bring in----- \n An Ceann Comhairle  The Deputy is to question the Taoiseach. \n Deputy Ivana Bacik  These are Taoiseach’s Questions, not questions to the Deputy. \n Deputy Barry Heneghan  I am sorry, but I did not interrupt the Deputy. Maybe the data centres develop their own on-site energy and help us reach our climate goals. \n Deputy Mary Lou McDonald  What is wrong with Deputy Heneghan? \n Deputy Ruairí Ó Murchú  We all know the enormous work that needs to be done on flood protection and flood mitigation. In my county, there have been many promises regarding the CFRAM. Even in the part of Dundalk that I live in, there is a significant flood risk. Accepting these works are going to be done, there is still an issue with insurance and insurance companies in terms of flood protection and people attaining mortgages. At one stage, Louth County Council and others were willing to provide the information that the area no longer suffered flooding, but that has not happened, so we need mitigation measures for these people. \n The Taoiseach  First of all, I thank the Deputies for raising those issues. Deputy Bacik raised the question of how we square the circle as regards data centres and AI. There needs to be a balanced debate in this House on this question because digitalisation and the green economy are both pathways we have to pursue. There is no question about that. I would take issue with Deputy Coppinger’s statement that we have to stop \"worshipping\" AI and \"worshipping\" data centres. Nobody worships anything, but we do have a realistic assessment that AI is going to have an extraordinary impact on the world of employment and how society is organised. If the Deputy wants to put her head in the sand, then she should put her head in the sand, but that will not advance the country. It will not advance employment. It will not advance society itself. We have to engage and be leaders in AI.  Deputy Bacik referenced the moratorium. That is problematic, too. We have had an effective moratorium for the past two to three years on data centres. There have been some contracted into, which will come on stream later in the decade, but AI will use an awful lot more energy, by definition. We have a challenge between now and 2030 or 2031, that period by when, I hope, our offshore wind farms will have gone through planning and all the rest of it and we can have had minimal objections and got the wind farms built. That will power our energy needs in the 2030s. It is between now and then that we certainly have a challenge and we certainly have an issue in terms of squaring the circle. The Government is working on that. It is not a choice between housing and data centres. Every person on the street has a need for data centres, by the way, in terms of our everyday activities and so forth. The idea of trying to paint them as the big bad entity, as it were, in this context does not make sense.  Deputy Byrne raised an important issue. I attended the UN ocean summit recently hosted by France. Ireland is increasingly making a significant contribution to the international debate on the oceans. Regarding coastal erosion, I invite the Deputy to make a submission to the Minister for public expenditure. I certainly will be doing that. I will talk abut and raise this issue at central government level. I believe that, on adaptation, we need to do far more in terms of capital provision for adapting to climate change. Climate change is here and now; it is not something that is going to come in ten years' time. It is affecting flooding. It is eroding coastlines. It is putting homes in danger. It is affecting food production patterns and so on. I believe that, in the next national development plan, there has to be ring-fenced funding for the cost of climate change to enable us to adapt to protect. It would be useful, knowing that the Deputy has been successful in the past in making various submissions to various bodies, if he could likewise make a submission in this regard. It is important.  Deputy Ó Cearúil spoke about the risks and private wire legislation, which Deputy Heneghan has raised consistently, to be fair. The Minister, Deputy O’Brien, has initiated the sustainable use of public and private assets, SUPPA, group. There had not been a lot of work done on it before that, if I am honest. Now, he has instructed the Department to prepare the legislation. I have spoken to the Attorney General and work is under way in respect of a private wires dimension to this, which will be very important and will give greater flexibility to companies and so on. Storm Éowyn illustrated the risks.  Regarding Deputy Moynihan and skills, there is a significant degree of work going on. The Minister of State, Marian Harkin, has particular responsibility for the area of green skills. Skillnet, which the Deputy knows is a business-supported network for skills development in companies, has funding available to it in respect of green skills. It is present in further and higher education. There has been a lot of transition from people in the fossil fuels industry to the renewable industry. It is an extremely important area that we are very much focused on.  In respect of Deputy McDonald's question on the Bord na Móna recycling unit, the industrial relations mechanisms are there. I will ask Bord na Móna to engage on the issue. I will speak to the Minister about it also.  Deputy Heneghan raised the issue of private wires, which is in the programme for Government.  As I said, the Minister, Deputy O'Brien, is preparing the legislation and has instructed his officials to do so.  Deputy Ó Murchú raised the issue of flood mitigation. Flooding is a big issue. We have a lot of consultation on and objection to flood relief plans, infrastructure developments and so on to prevent flooding. We need to accelerate them and we ask people, if they could, to hold off on the objections. It is extraordinary the degree to which some very worthy projects have been delayed. The objective is to protect people's homes, businesses and farmlands from being flooded, yet there is an inordinate delay in the planning process and so on in getting them done.  The insurance issue is ongoing. I dealt with it again last week. The State supports by compensation where flooding happens. The insurance companies have a responsibility and they need to step up to the plate in respect of it, particularly in areas where flooding infrastructure has been put in place. We still hear reports that some insurance companies do not offer policies after that has been done. ",

        "answerText": " The Taoiseach  I propose to take Questions Nos. 9 to 16, inclusive together.  As agreed by the Government, the Department of the Taoiseach has convened an interdepartmental group to examine the recommendations made by the Dublin city task force. The goal is to make Dublin city centre a more thriving, attractive and safe cityscape and a desirable location to live, work and do business in and visit. To deliver on these missions, the task force identified ten big moves that it recommended be addressed.  I met Mr. David McRedmond, CEO of An Post, who chaired the task force, in April to discuss the IDG's work to take forward the task force's recommendations. The IDG is currently finalising its report, which will be the subject of a memorandum to be submitted to the Government next week. Following this, further consideration will be given to how best the task force approach could be deployed in other cities, towns and regions, as outlined in the programme for Government. Regarding the memo to Government, there is obviously then a further context, which is the national development plan. \n An Ceann Comhairle  The Deputy has a minute and a half, as we have fewer Deputies than questions. \n Deputy Ivana Bacik  I have two questions about the task force. We see a huge number of issues in Dublin that need to be addressed urgently. There is a deteriorating public realm, vast numbers of vacant sites and derelict buildings, mouldy and damp social housing, including issues with social housing complexes in my constituency, and a lack of joined-up thinking about keeping spaces safe.  Given the need for funding to be put in place to implement the recommendations of the task force, will the Taoiseach consider allowing local authorities to levy a hotel bed tax if they wish in order to raise funds to be invested in local infrastructure? That is my first question.  Second, will the Government ensure the maintenance of face-to-face public services? I speak in particular about postal services. It is somewhat ironic that the chief executive officer of An Post was the independent chair of the task force, yet An Post has been closing postal services in Dublin city. I speak particularly about Rathmines post office, which was in an iconic 1934 building in the heart of Rathmines. We have just learned it is to be closed by An Post, with the service to be moved elsewhere and, apparently, the building to be put up for sale. This sends an unfortunate signal to communities. We are seeing face-to-face public services close and iconic public realm buildings being put up for sale to the private sector. That is a loss to the community. We have seen the loss of Citizens Information Board face-to-face services, and this in turn has a negative impact on the public realm. What does the Taoiseach propose to do about this? \n Deputy Séamus McGrath  I raise the Cork city task force. As we know, the programme for Government provides for the establishment of a task force for Cork city. Like all urban areas, Cork city needs renewed focus, funding, resources, collaboration between key stakeholders, and short-, medium- and long-term planning. I hope the task force will address issues around public realm, streetscape, urban design and investment in our urban design in Cork city. Safety on the streets of Cork city is a significant issue. This not only relates to Garda numbers, but also to how the city is designed and laid out. That is critical when it comes to safety issues, as are connectivity, transportation links to the city, vacancy, dereliction and so on. Can we get an update on the establishment of the Cork city task force? It is important. Cork City Council will play a critical role in this as it moves forward and I hope we can get a clear, concrete indication today about the establishment of the task force, which is in the programme for Government. \n Deputy Mark Ward  The Dublin city task force and Dublin City Council recommended that a single waste management company should provide bin collection services, with a further recommendation that, in the long term, waste services should be taken under the control of Dublin City Council. This is positive and will be welcomed by householders across Dublin. The Oireachtas Joint Committee on the Environment and Climate Action made a similar recommendation. The wholesale privatisation of bin services in 2012, which was opposed every step of the way by Sinn Féin, has been a complete and utter disaster for Dublin. It has led to a wild west situation, where up to a dozen bin companies charge ever-increasing prices for a service that is not fit for purpose. Waste management companies are operating like a cartel. Will the Government's task force on Dublin tackle the privatisation of waste management and bring it back to public ownership? \n Deputy Pádraig O'Sullivan  Back in February, Deputy McGrath and I raised the issue of the city task force with the Taoiseach, who confirmed that proposals were being developed and, once finalised, would be submitted to the Government for consideration. As yet, no formal announcement has been made regarding the establishment of a task force in Cork city. We are well into the term of this Government at this stage. I listened to Mr. Sean O'Driscoll this morning on my way up to Dublin. He spoke about many things the Taoiseach and I have spoken about here over the years, including getting rid of roadblocks, cutting through the malaise of planning and getting things delivered. I have concerns about what I am hearing about the task force, including its composition. I have spoken previously about the lack of political representation that is proposed to be on it. Nonetheless, can we just get on with the job of establishing the task force? If the Taoiseach can provide any clarity on that, we would appreciate it. \n Deputy Ruairí Ó Murchú  It has now been 239 days since the recommendations of the Dublin city task force were published and 145 days since the programme for Government, which included a commitment to these recommendations, was agreed. The recommendations are aimed at rejuvenating Dublin city centre, focusing on the public realm, safety and overall experience. Such is the lack of tangible progress in initiatives such as revitalising O'Connell Street, increasing residential density and improving public safety that the task force's ten big moves are beginning to look like ten wasted opportunities or, more shamefully, ten election promises that have been quickly forgotten. Without dedicated funding and a clear roadmap for delivery, the task force's recommendations will remain another shelved document rather than a catalyst for real change.  The workers and students of Parnell Square and the residents and business owners of Frederick Street North want to know when the Government will announce ring-fenced budgets for the task force recommendations, when the inner city communities will begin to feel the revitalisation the task force aims to achieve and when there will be a decisive shift from recommendations to robust action.  Across the State we need to see community safety partnerships up and running with the right model, membership and resourcing. Time is of the essence. \n Deputy Tom Brabazon  I also wanted to raise this matter. I welcome that the task force is there and has been proposed. There is some concern at city council level about the task force's level of funding to achieve the goals it sets for itself, which are welcome, including the creation of an attractive, safe streetscape and a desirable location to live, work and do business in and visit. Many of my constituents on the northside of Dublin have voiced the view to me that they are afraid to come in to the city. Some of the work done by the Minister in providing more gardaí for the city centre at Store Street and Pearse Street is welcome, including by the public in general, but there is a sense that some of the problems have been displaced to the suburbs as a result and some of the areas now under construction and those that have been constructed in the past 15 or 20 years, certainly on the northside in my experience, are going down the road of suffering from the same problems as the north inner city. We will have to look at that in a bigger, more holistic way. \n Deputy Paul McAuliffe  I know that, as a Cork man, the Taoiseach will join me in saying how great Dublin city is, but as great as it is, we certainly have challenges, especially in the city centre. The task force report was an important way of identifying those challenges.  The challenge now will be delivering them. Within the Dublin City Council structure, there certainly seems to be the appetite to establish a dedicated vehicle to deal with the issues relating to derelict sites and also to fund improvements and additional services, for example, the business improvement district scheme which applies an additional levy on ratepayers in the city, something that Fianna Fáil introduced at the time. I am not opposed to a tourism levy and introducing legislation would allow the local authorities to decide whether they want to apply one. At this point we need certainty on funding for the task force. Whether that comes from central government or whether we are going to enable local government to raise the funding, one way or the other, funding is the crucial step needed to deliver the task force. \n Deputy Barry Heneghan  Regarding the task force, I welcome what Deputies McAuliffe and Brabazon said about north Dublin. What steps are being taken to make development of residential space above shops in Dublin's inner city easier? There are major issues with licences for fire safety.  Is there any update on the proposed late-night licensing reforms and the Give Us The Night campaign? Young people in Ireland feel they are not welcome in Dublin city as we saw recently with Drury Street being closed off. If we want the city to be revitalised, the young people of Dublin need to be encouraged to come in. If the late licences go to 6 a.m., we will still have one of the earliest in Europe, but it would encourage people in. \n The Taoiseach  Did the Deputy say 6 a.m.? \n Deputy Barry Heneghan  Yes, 6 a.m. We should bring it up. In Berlin it is 24-7. \n The Taoiseach  Deputy Heneghan is full of energy.  I thank all the Deputies for raising various issues. Deputies McGrath and O'Sullivan asked about the Cork city task force. The docklands have been the main development focus in Cork city for some time. Under the urban regeneration and development fund, URDF, some years ago €400 million was allocated to Cork for the docklands and the Grand Parade new library. Considerable progress has been made in the docklands, but not so much on the city library. I met representatives of Cork City Council recently to discuss these issues. Cork City Council is anxious about the city centre. Along with the Land Development Agency, LDA, and others, it is delivering on the docklands which is becoming an engine of real power and growth in the city of Cork. I believe it is coming forward with further proposals on the Grand Parade and on the library, which will be transformative. We always need to be conscious that the existing agencies will be crucial - Dublin City Council, Cork City Council and Cork County Council. Regarding Cork city, a lot of money will be channelled through the National Transport Authority, for example, the BusConnects proposal. The route for the light rail has been published. The N28 has been sanctioned. That will potentially come to about €490 million with all the knock-ons and so on. There will also be other infrastructure development.  The task force will come back with proposals for the city. It needs to look at how we reimagine cities of the future. We tend to look at it through the prism of the past and what cities used to be like, whereas we need to look at what they will be like or what we think they will be like in the future. We need a different mix with stronger residential focus in city centres in the future with less of the big anchor retail tenant type. There might be more niche quality hospitality and retail. I would a new task force for the city of Cork to try to reimagine the city centre, the core of the city, for the future as opposed to trying to do everything across the entirety of the city. We will come back with proposals on that.  We have been working on the Dublin city task force and the idea is to bring to the Government a memorandum that has substance. Everyone has raised the issue of funding. \n Deputy Ivana Bacik  The hotel bed tax. \n The Taoiseach  Deputy Bacik raised that; I apologise. I am not opposed to that because I like the concept whereby we acknowledge funding is required and propose a mechanism. It will not fund everything. We will not be awash money. \n Deputy Ivana Bacik  I think it will be €12 million. \n The Taoiseach  A very minimalist levy could yield ongoing revenue that would be of significant use for Dublin City Council to get things done. That is an important principle because increasing numbers are coming in, impacting on services and so on.  I think David McRedmond has done a good job overall at An Post. He has modernised it and he has----- \n Deputy Ivana Bacik  The closure of services. \n The Taoiseach  It is not his remit. There have been issues with people retiring and so on. It has not been an easy one. Government has had to intervene and step in with €10 million to support postmasters and will continue to intervene to support postmasters. I want to put on record that I think overall and in difficult circumstances he has done a good job.  Deputy Ó Murchú asked about the public realm. They are not ten wasted opportunities.  Deputy McAuliffe made a proposal around a special purpose vehicle. We are actively looking at that in terms of the presentation of the memo. Temple Bar and other initiatives that have had an impact involved legally created special purpose vehicles that had authority to get things done and did actually deliver a lot in their day. We are examining that in respect of the outcome of the Dublin task force.  The public realm needs enhancement and Deputy Brabazon focused on that as well in terms of a safe streetscape. It is worrying that in the modern era, an increasing number of people are expressing fear of going into city centres, not just in Dublin but also elsewhere. The Minister, Deputy Paschal Donohoe, told me there was a significant group of European officials in last week and they thought Dublin city was great. I agree with Deputy McAuliffe that Dublin is a great city, but a lot of stuff is happening that gives people a sense of fear of going into the city centre at night.  Regarding the issue Deputy Heneghan raised, I think the Minister, Deputy O'Callaghan, is progressing that. I will check with him. There has been a seesaw approach to late night openings. Licensing laws are notoriously difficult. We need to consider all the patterns of behaviour that have changed. \n Deputy Barry Heneghan  They boost the economy. \n The Taoiseach  People are doing different things and are behaving differently. That said, I will come back to the Deputy with where that legislation is at. ",

        "answerText": " The Taoiseach  I propose to take Questions Nos. 17 to 24, inclusive, together.  The Programme for Government 2025, Securing Ireland's Future, sets out a number of commitments relating to national security and defence, and work to give effect to these is well under way. The establishment of a ministerial council on national security is a key commitment in the programme for Government and it will function to enhance central co-ordination on strategic national security matters.  I chaired the first meeting of the new council on 21 May 2025. The council received a detailed, up-to-date briefing on the current security situation from An Garda Síochána and the Defence Forces, and also on current cyberthreats.  The council meeting also reviewed commitments relating to national security and defence set out in the programme for Government and re-emphasised the importance of delivery of these commitments.  It is clear, in light of the worsened security situation in Europe and significant changes in the nature of the security challenges we and our partners face, that accelerated and increased investment in the State’s security and defence services will be required in the coming period.  The council received a detailed report from the national security committee. It considered current challenges in the international environment, including the war in Ukraine and conflict in the Middle East, and the implications for Ireland; the ongoing work on the reform and modernisation of the Defence Forces; the continued development of the State’s cybersecurity capabilities; and the ongoing work to strengthen and modernise our security-related legislation.  The preparation of a draft national security strategy is ongoing and it will cover the range of national security issues that are being considered by the ministerial council.  Work is also under way on a revised cybersecurity strategy and responsibility for the National Cyber Security Centre now rests under the Minister for Justice, Home Affairs and Migration. This is another important programme for Government commitment, which better aligns the Department's national security responsibilities. The ministerial council will meet again after the summer. \n Deputy Naoise Ó Cearúil  The Taoiseach will recall that in 2021 the HSE experienced a cyberattack. The estimated cost to the HSE was in the region €102 million. The upgrade costs on its security amounted to an estimated €657 million. With the rise of artificial intelligence, we are now seeing far more sophisticated cyberattacks. I have asked the Deputy Malcolm Byrne, the chair of the Joint Committee on Artificial Intelligence, whether the committee could look at cyberattacks, particularly from an AI perspective. Is the ministerial council on national security assessing how cyberattacks will change with the rise of artificial intelligence? AI is far more sophisticated and has changed dramatically over the past number of years. It will continue to change. It will not be static. The ministerial council meets once every two or three months. It might get to a stage where it needs to meet a little more frequently. \n Deputy Ivana Bacik  In December 2022, I wrote to the Taoiseach, who was the then Tánaiste, and the then Taoiseach, former Deputy Leo Varadkar, seeking updates on the national security strategy and also seeking briefings for Opposition leaders on national security, as is standard in many countries. That was in the context of Russia's brutal war in Ukraine, the cyberattack on the HSE and reports of Russian spies in Ireland. Since then, desperately sadly and tragically, we have seen 20 months of Israel's genocidal bombardment and onslaught upon the people of Gaza and, most recently, an escalating war in the Middle East with Israel now openly attacking Iran. I urge restraint, as I know the Taoiseach has done, from both Israel and Iran. I ask this because EU foreign ministers are to meet with southern neighbourhood countries next Monday, 23 June. I understand those countries include Israel. In light of what Israel is doing on the world stage and in Gaza, will Ireland be participating in that meeting with Israel? Has the Taoiseach called for Israel not to be included in that meeting?  Closer to home, I also want to ask about a story that has been highlighted by my colleague, Deputy Alan Kelly, on concerns about the control of firearms in Ireland, in particular with how the Garda Commissioner handled the incident around a controlled delivery to a vulnerable young man. Deputy Kelly has also raised issues with holsters and the storage of weapons in Garda headquarters. Is the Taoiseach satisfied with the Commissioner and with An Garda Síochána's handling of these matters? \n Deputy Ruth Coppinger  What is our country's security strategy going forward? It seems to be so tied in with the EU that we cannot assert our own so-called values and beliefs. For example, the Taoiseach says there is a genocide on Gaza, as does the Tánaiste. Ursula von der Leyen says it is Israel defending itself. It was an incredible statement that was put out over the weekend, after Israel had bombed Iran, to say that this was Israel defending itself. We have also seen 330 Palestinians murdered at food sites, which are now becoming known as execution sites, backed by the US. This is the policy of the EU Commissioner. Has the Taoiseach taken her up on that? Has he challenged what she said and demanded that Ireland break ranks with that?  In regard to our military spending and EU policy, we are going to be spending an incredible amount on fighter jets and so on, bringing us into contact with companies that are directly involved in the genocide in Palestine, such as Lockheed Martin, Raytheon and Airbus. Last year, the Taoiseach said we would not be buying Israeli equipment. There is Israeli equipment in the Airbus helicopters. That is a complete change from what was promised. The Taoiseach gave a commitment on this. Our foreign and security policy is now becoming more militarised. We are going to increase spending to €3 billion in the next few years, spending money on armoured vehicles and spending €100 million on fighter jets and €40 million on advanced missile systems known as javelins. \n An Leas-Cheann Comhairle  I ask Deputy Coppinger to conclude. \n Deputy Ruth Coppinger  We are doing all this to impress the EU but it is not what the Irish people want. \n Deputy Tom Brabazon  As the Taoiseach will be aware, in 2019 the Government proposed to develop a national security strategy. The new strategy at that time aimed to set out a whole-of-government approach on how the State could protect its national security and vital interests. Over a period of five years, from 2020 to 2025, the current and emerging threats have changed significantly and the threats have increased significantly, particularly given the international context in which we find ourselves, to which other Deputies have alluded.  I welcome that national security is given such a high profile, with the Taoiseach, the Tánaiste, the Ministers for foreign affairs, Defence, Justice, Home Affairs and Migration, the Secretaries General of those Departments, the Defence Forces Chief of Staff, the National Cyber Security Centre director, and the Taoiseach's and Tánaiste's chiefs of staff also attending meetings. It is crucial that the council keeps abreast of this issue and meets regularly to keep on top of the continuing threats.  I welcome the fact that the State has announced a contract to develop a new sonar system which will be a towed sonar capability. When attached to an Irish naval vessel, it will assist the Defence Forces with monitoring subsea areas in Ireland's exclusive economic zones. It will help with fisheries, drug and other criminal detection. \n Deputy Ruairí Ó Murchú  We have had the disgraceful action by the genocidal entity, Israel, with its escalation of attacks on Iran. This draws into question the EU-Israel association agreement and we need to see movement on that, post-haste. We already knew that. The occupied territories Bill obviously has to be delivered and apply to services. Beyond that, what is the plan? The Taoiseach might not agree with the Sinn Féin legislation to stop the State and the Central Bank from facilitating the sale of Israel's war bonds, which are used to finance the genocide. In regard to national security strategy, how does it take into account the cyberthreats? We are dealing with issues with spy software such as Predator and Pegasus. What resources, capabilities and legislation do we require? Where is the crossover between the National Cyber Security Centre, the Defence Forces and the Department of justice? We want something that works. We all welcome the fact that we will have sonar capacity. We need to ensure our undersea cables are secure. \n Deputy Mark Ward  In response to a parliamentary question to my colleague Donnchadh Ó Laoghaire last month, the Taoiseach said that the development of Ireland's first national security strategy is still ongoing, almost seven years after a Government commission called for it. The report of the Commission on the Future of Policing in Ireland recommended the immediate establishment of a strategic threat analysis centre, headed by a full-time national security adviser. This was a much-needed and welcome development but it is extremely disappointing that it has not developed to any great extent beyond this announcement. It is long past time that the Government got serious in the area of security and defence. We have a recruitment and retention crisis in our Defence Forces. Key personnel are leaving the Defence Forces and we need to put a halt to this. We need to ensure our Defence Forces are protected and invested in. In a time of ever-increasing global instability and of irresponsible and dangerous rhetoric by those in positions of great power, such as Ursula von der Leyen, it is more important now than ever that Ireland stands for peace and neutrality and has an effective security strategy in the face of the dangerous militarisation agenda driven by power, greed and war.  Almost seven years after a Government commission called for Ireland's first national security strategy, will the Taoiseach give a firm timeline and a direct answer on its delivery? \n The Taoiseach  I thank the Deputies who have raised issues. I will make a general comment. This question related to the national security committee, national security council and national security strategy, not foreign policy. This is welcome. I established a national security council as Taoiseach to try to bring greater democratic accountability on matters pertaining to national security. It is up to people to raise what they like at different times. However, there is a logic in trying to focus on core security issues as opposed to foreign policy issues which we debate elsewhere in the House, just to make that overall point.  Deputy Ó Cearúil was first. On cybersecurity, the National Cyber Security Centre is coming in under the Minister for justice. This is a welcome move. The centre was under communications, climate and all that area. It belongs to a national security framework and it will be under the Minister for justice. The director is on the national security council. The Deputy's point is well made in terms of the rise of AI and the impact it will have on more sophisticated and perhaps more regular cyberattacks on companies and State enterprises. We have to be extremely vigilant. Cyber warfare is the biggest problem we have in cybersecurity. Many companies face cybersecurity attacks on a regular basis. We have to build up expertise. We also have to work with others. We cannot do it on our own. We have to work with other countries on cybersecurity in terms of expertise and sharing experiences. When the cyberattack on our health service happened, Poland and the United Kingdom were on to us immediately. Poland had experience with the Conti group, which carried out the attack on our health service. There will be collaboration with other countries and we do need constant engagement with other countries across the European Union and beyond in respect of cybersecurity threats to all law-abiding states. I just want to make that overall point.  On Deputy Bacik's points, I am not going to comment on Garda operational issues. The national security council committee will not be dealing with operational matters of An Garda Síochána in terms of what happens on a day-to-day basis. It is looking more at threats to the State from third party actors, which could be countries or individuals who could be doing certain things that could endanger or cause a risk to the security of the State. On the issue Deputy Kelly raised, I responded in the Dáil and the Minister for justice is responding as well. In terms of that meeting which the Deputy did raise again last week, I will ask the Minister for foreign affairs and will have to come back to the Deputy on it.  Deputy Coppinger raised what are essentially foreign policy issues. Our security strategy is not beholden to the European Union. It is very much fundamentally about national security, protecting our own citizens from any undermining of our security, via cyber security attacks, subsea cable attacks, hybrid attacks, misinformation on social media, or terrorist attacks, although they are low in terms of possibility here, but nonetheless all those areas----- \n Deputy Ruth Coppinger  The Taoiseach mentioned the Middle East. That is why I mentioned it. \n The Taoiseach  ----are subject to potential threats in terms of national security. We have been very consistent at European Union level in terms of our position on the right of Palestinians to their own state. We have called out the war crimes and the blatant, flagrant abuses of international law by Israel in Gaza and indeed increasingly now in the West Bank, which is a cause of great concern. We will not be spending money on fighter jets for a long time, for quite some time. Our immediate focus is on radar. We have purchased C295s. There will be a further strategic lift aeroplane purchased very shortly. We are building up our investment but we are coming from an incredibly low base as a country. The Deputy's language was around the militarisation of Ireland but we are a long way off that. We need to have a sense of perspective and balance in this debate. We do need to invest in our Army and Naval Service. Maybe the Deputy's party does not believe in armies or navies and that is a legitimate position to have. Perhaps that is the Deputy's position. I believe we need an Army, a Naval Service and an Air Corps and we need to invest. They need the best of equipment because they go on peacekeeping missions and they share that equipment with other countries like Poland at the moment in Lebanon, and with Hungary, so they need to have interoperability in weaponry. \n Deputy Ruth Coppinger  And the Israeli equipment? \n The Taoiseach  We cannot just label all defence as some sort of appalling activity or sector. It is necessary for the protection of citizens.  I will come back to Deputy Brabazon on the timelines around the national security strategy. It is important. My Department is co-ordinating this. There is a national security secretariat in my Department. It is now putting together inputs from all the different Departments, including the Departments of Foreign Affairs and Trade; Defence; justice; and environment, climate and communications; An Garda Síochána; the National Cyber Security Centre; and the Defence Forces. We are going ahead with the smaller radar.  In response to Deputy Ó Murchú, I have made my comments in terms of Israel. That is more in the foreign policy domain and will not come under the national security council or committee. I take the Deputy's point that cyber threats are a big concern. The National Cyber Security Centre is now under the Minister for justice, as I said. I take Deputy Ward's point that there is a need to bring this to a conclusion and to develop and publish the strategy. ",

It is a function of the Council under the Teaching Council Acts (s7(2)) to act as the competent authority for recognition of qualifications obtained by a person who has applied under this Act for registration as a teacher.  The Teaching Council register teachers under the Teaching Council Act 2001-2015 and in line with:  www.teachingcouncil.ie/en/publications/registration/revised-teaching-council-registration-regulations-2016.pdf  As set out in the Schedule of the Regulations, the Council registers teachers under five routes of registration: Route 1 - Primary, Route 2 - Post-primary, Route 3 - Further Education, Route 4 - Other and Route 5 - Student Teacher. The qualification requirements for each route are set out in the Schedule of the Regulations.  The Teaching Council is the regulator of the teaching profession in Ireland. Their role is to protect the public by promoting and regulating professional standards in teaching.  They do this through the statutory registration of teachers, ensuring a highly qualified teaching profession, whose members meet and uphold high standards of professional competence and conduct.  Central to Initial Teacher Education policy in Ireland is that all teachers teaching children with Special Educational Needs (SEN) should be qualified Primary or Post-primary teachers in the first instance. The Teaching Council as the professional standards body for the teaching profession, sets the standards for programmes of initial teacher education (ITE) and reviews and accredits programmes provided by Higher Education Institutions (HEIs) in the State, based on those standards. All programmes of ITE in Ireland that led to registration must have professional accreditation from the Teaching Council. The standards for programmes of ITE, which were revised in 2020, are published in www.teachingcouncil.ie/assets/uploads/2023/08/ceim-standards-for-initial-teacher-education.pdf  The standards set Inclusive Education as one of the seven core elements which must unpin all aspects of the programme of ITE. Once qualified as a Primary or Post-primary teachers, they may then apply for professional development in the area of SEN, if desired.  Cognisant that teacher education policies vary among countries, Route 4 provides for teachers who have qualified outside of Ireland specifically with an initial teacher education programme in teaching children with special educational needs.

        "answerText": " Minister for Education and Youth  Under the Teaching Council Acts 2001-2015 the Teaching Council is the body with the statutory authority and responsibility for the regulation of the teaching profession in Ireland including the registration of teachers in the state.  It is a function of the Council under the Teaching Council Acts (s7(2)) to act as the competent authority for recognition of qualifications obtained by a person who has applied under this Act for registration as a teacher.  The Teaching Council register teachers under the Teaching Council Act 2001-2015 and in line with the www.teachingcouncil.ie/en/publications/registration/revised-teaching-council-registration-regulations-2016.pdf As set out in the Schedule of the Regulations, the Council registers teachers under five routes of registration: Route 1 - Primary, Route 2 - Post-primary, Route 3 - Further Education, Route 4 - Other and Route 5 - Student Teacher. The qualification requirements for each route are set out in the Schedule of the Regulations.  The Teaching Council is the regulator of the teaching profession in Ireland. Their role is to protect the public by promoting and regulating professional standards in teaching.  They do this through the statutory registration of teachers, ensuring a highly qualified teaching profession, whose members meet and uphold high standards of professional competence and conduct.  Central to Initial Teacher Education policy in Ireland is that all teachers teaching children with Special Educational Needs (SEN) should be qualified Primary or Post-primary teachers in the first instance. The Teaching Council as the professional standards body for the teaching profession, sets the standards for programmes of initial teacher education (ITE) and reviews and accredits programmes provided by Higher Education Institutions (HEIs) in the State, based on those standards. All programmes of ITE in Ireland that led to registration must have professional accreditation from the Teaching Council. The standards for programmes of ITE, which were revised in 2020, are published in eur05.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.teachingcouncil.ie%2Fassets%2Fuploads%2F2023%2F08%2Fceim-standards-for-initial-teacher-education.pdf&data=05%7C02%7CAmanda_Carthy%40education.gov.ie%7C3957034da1dd43e1833708dda2bf1038%7Cf5c0d15a869347e3b506b1617300787f%7C0%7C0%7C638845663849988950%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJFbXB0eU1hcGkiOnRydWUsIlYiOiIwLjAuMDAwMCIsIlAiOiJXaW4zMiIsIkFOIjoiTWFpbCIsIldUIjoyfQ%3D%3D%7C0%7C%7C%7C&sdata=YV5mtSVwfWEkfZrYCR0jMPtKp9FC9vWBr%2FtJhWDXrOU%3D&reserved=0 The standards set Inclusive Education as one of the seven core elements which must unpin all aspects of the programme of ITE.  Once qualified as a Primary or Post-primary teachers, they may then apply for professional development in the area of SEN, if desired.  Cognisant that teacher education policies vary among countries, Route 4 provides for teachers who have qualified outside of Ireland specifically with an initial teacher education programme in teaching children with special educational needs.

I know there is broad-based support for the scheme , and I recently met with the National Campaign for the Arts (NCFA) to hear its views on the scheme in detail. I fully understand the anxiety of pilot payment recipients in particular and intends to bring clarity on this situation in the coming weeks.  Evaluation of the pilot is continuous, as participants complete a survey every six months. My Department is currently preparing a report examining the first 24 months of the scheme. This report will be available on gov.ie, along with the two reports published to date.  A further interview research paper, written by an independent researcher was published recently. This paper collects the experiences of 50 BIA recipients, who have been interviewed by a sociologist. A cost-benefit analysis paper is also being prepared.  While the research phase of the pilot scheme is still ongoing, it is clear from evidence collected to date under the scheme that it is having a positive impact on participants. This data shows that the BIA payment is having a consistent, positive impact across almost all indicators. Artists in receipt of the support are typically able to devote more time to their art, produce more pieces of work, experience a boost to their wellbeing through greater life satisfaction and reduced anxiety, and are protected from the precariousness of incomes in the sector to a greater degree than those who are not receiving the support.  It is important to note that the pilot is a research programme, and that no decision has been taken as to the continuation of BIA, and that the research evaluating the impact of the pilot scheme is ongoing.  No decision has therefore been taken as to whether if there were a successor scheme who would be eligible for it.  A Government decision will be required on a successor scheme to the pilot, and the future of the BIA will be decided when the final results of the research are available which will provide the Government with the evidence base upon which to base future policy decisions about the Basic Income for the Arts.

The Cabinet Committee on Disability last met on 28th April and is due to meet again on the 5th of June.  A disability unit is being established in Department of the Taoiseach. The unit is supporting the work of the Cabinet Committee on Disability. It is also supporting the work of the Minister for Children, Disability, and Equality and other Ministers in driving cross-government, inter-agency and inter-disciplinary working and collaboration to improve the lives of people with disabilities and enable them to achieve their potential. It is being put in place to work with Ministers and Departments to help focus on delivering positive change.  A work programme for the unit is currently being finalised which will inform the overall resources required for the unit.  A Ministerial meeting and two Cabinet Committees have been held to date, in addition to broader cross Government engagement on finalisation of the next National Disability Strategy.  It is important to ensure that the work of the unit does not duplicate others work, rather it should further drive innovation, troubleshoot when necessary, give momentum to policy implementation and improve delivery of services.  It is not intended to displace Ministerial or Departmental responsibility, accountability and oversight for delivery. Ministers and Departments continue to hold primary responsibility for delivery of all Programme for Government commitments, for Oireachtas accountability and sectoral engagement. "
