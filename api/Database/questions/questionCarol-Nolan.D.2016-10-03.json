        "answerText": " Minister of State at the Department of Justice, Home Affairs and Migration  I propose to take Questions Nos. 322 to 325, inclusive, 329, 330, 333, 334 and 338 to 341, inclusive, together.  My Department holds meetings with individual firearms organisations on request and engages with various firearms stakeholders, including representative firearms organisations, in various ways.  An Garda Síochána also meets with firearms stakeholder organisations in respect of relevant matters.  Officials from my Department also liaise regularly with the Firearms Policy Unit of An Garda Síochána on firearms-related matters.  Earlier this year, my Department organised a series of engagements with firearms stakeholders in Wicklow, Limerick, Carrick-on-Shannon and Mullingar.  I and officials from my Department have also met with representative organisations, including the FURG (Firearms Users Representative Group) and the NARGC (National Association of Regional Games Councils).  In these and other engagements, I have confirmed my support for more regular and structured engagement between policy makers and firearms users than has taken place since the last meeting of the Firearms Consultative Panel (FCP) in 2019.  I can advise that ongoing engagement has continued with firearms stakeholders.  The most recent engagement took place on the 1st December, where more than 20 representatives of the firearms community and firearms stakeholder organisations attended a meeting with my officials. One of these meetings also took place on the 18th September.  Due to the nature of these initial engagements, formal minutes were not taken. This approach is to ensure proceedings would be open and transparent while facilitating frank and honest exchanges of views. This was explained at the beginning of the meetings.  As these engagements evolve, consideration will be given to the question of the publication of minutes of the meetings.  The objective of these meetings is to provide a mechanism for ongoing engagement with firearms stakeholders from a broad range of areas within the firearms community, ensuring their valuable insights in specific areas of firearms can be considered in any future policy and legislative changes that may arise.  The stakeholders attending these meetings include several from representative organisations, experts in technical areas of firearms and members of An Garda Síochána’s Firearms Policy Unit. Several of the stakeholders were also members of the FCP.  Stakeholder organisations are encouraged to make submissions to the meetings, engage with other stakeholders and contribute.  It is intended to continue the proactive and open engagement that has taken place.  Any stakeholder organisation that would like to contribute to these engagements is also welcome to engage with my Department on the matter. ",

      "question": {
        "answerText": " Deputy Carol Nolan  My question relates to the ongoing shortage of student accommodation across the country. Every year, the problem gets worse. In my constituency, I am contacted by huge numbers of students who cannot source accommodation in Galway, Dublin or Limerick. Unfortunately, the evidence available to us each September demonstrates that the situation is deteriorating rather than improving. What measures will be taken by the Government to tackle this problem? \n Deputy James Lawless  I thank the Deputy. I am very aware of the high cost of student accommodation and the burden it places on students, especially those from rural or outlying areas, although it is not limited to them. In my own household, which is in an urban area, my daughter has commuted to UCD for the past couple of years and it was not a short commute, despite the fact we are not terribly far away from the college geographically. There is an additional financial burden on students who have to make that commute or cannot secure accommodation.  The student accommodation strategy 2025-2035 will set out Ireland's national policy to support access to appropriate housing and accommodation for students. Through the strategy, I am committed to expanding supports that directly address affordability pressures on students, especially for those who need it most. In budget 2026, for example, I secured an additional €10.5 million to increase all non-adjacent maintenance grants under the student grant scheme by at least €200 - in most cases by more. That means all grants for people who are non-adjacent, which means they live 30 km or more from the college, have increased, and in some cases significantly. That is to reflect the fact that those students have an additional financial burden because they are travelling or having to pay for rent or accommodation. Some 30,000 students can avail of that. The 30 km figure is down from 45 km, so that support is available to more students than ever before.  My Department also provides measures such as the 1916 bursary and the student assistance fund to students with particular socioeconomic difficulties. I was pleased to announce today that I was increasing the student assistance fund again for the coming year by over €10.2 million. It is a discretionary fund available through the welfare officers in the colleges to support students with a range of additional costs and expenses.  That will now stand at €19.3 million for this academic year, which is a record high. In fact, it even exceeds the amount awarded only last year. I am committed to continuing those supports, targeting supports at people who need them most, and making sure the cost of college is mitigated as far as it can be by support from the Department. \n Deputy Carol Nolan  I thank the Minister for his response. While I certainly acknowledge that there have been some incentives, supports and improvements, the SUSI grant has unfortunately not been adjusted in line with the cost of living or the costs of student accommodation. We have seen over the past five years how rents in urban centres and many regional towns have risen at rates far exceeding inflation or wage growth.  In regard to the strategy, the delivery of purpose-built student accommodation has fallen substantially short of what is actually required, with only approximately 14,000 of the 21,000 beds targeted under the national student accommodation strategy having materialised by 2024. As a direct consequence, thousands of students now rely on temporary and often unsuitable arrangements such as staying in family homes, commuting long distances as the Minister acknowledged, or depending on the good will of relatives and friends. We really need to tackle this issue and be more ambitious in creating more student accommodation. \n Deputy James Lawless  I wish to confirm and restate that the maintenance grants have increased significantly in some cases, particularly those on the non-adjacent rungs of the grant system. That is something that is very important to me and that I was very determined to be able to do. As well as that, there is additional support for students with disabilities and mental health challenges. The thresholds have increased to the highest ever level, to the extent that 80% of households are now eligible for at least some form of grant support. Of course, the student fee itself has been permanently discounted by €500 from the base figure I inherited at the start of this year. These are all positive steps.  The technological sector student accommodation programme is a particular accommodation package within the technological universities. Feasibility studies were performed over the past two years and the technological universities were invited to submit proposals, which they have done. The preliminary business cases will be examined in the new year to consider those projects and where they go next. I will come back in the next round. \n Deputy Carol Nolan  I acknowledge that there have been some improvements but again, it is just not enough. We need to be, as I said, far more ambitious and deliver more student accommodation. I want to point out that my concerns relate to the fact that when a young person from a rural background concludes that third level education is financially or logistically unfeasible, the loss extends far beyond the individual. Society is deprived of the nurses, engineers, teachers and researchers that we so badly need in Ireland. Therefore, I ask the Minister to address the following specific points in his response to me. What immediate supports or emergency measures is the Department implementing in this academic year for students who are currently sofa surfing or living in unaffordable private rentals? Will the Government now give serious consideration to the introduction of rent controls or caps specifically for purpose-built accommodation? Is the Minister prepared to commit to a ring-fenced, State-led programme of student bed construction? Will he bring forward, as a matter of urgency, an inflation-adjusted increase in the SUSI maintenance grant and a substantial reform and expansion of the rent a room relief scheme? \n Deputy James Lawless  I am glad the Deputy mentioned the rent a room scheme because that is an important tax relief that is available. Householders can earn up to €14,000 per year tax free by renting rooms to students. It has also been extended to local authority tenants, and at the end of last month, over 5,200 rent a room student beds were on offer in higher education institutions across the country, so that is a very significant measure.  In regard to the stock that is on hand, the Deputy mentioned the level of delivery in her opening question. One issue that is of concern to me is that there are almost 15,000 student beds that have planning permission but have not actually moved to construction. We need to look at the reasons that might be the case. A lot of that comes from viability. I refer to things like the VAT reduction on new apartment building. We will look at the procurement supports that are there and measures we can use to stimulate. Where appropriate, there is funding in the system to make serviced sites available where colleges have sites. They can be encouraged to put them to use for student accommodation to try to get some of those 15,000 beds, and a lot more, unlocked and progressed. ",

While in the event of an economic downturn and unexpected deterioration in the public finance we would postpone changes to Income Tax credits or bands, as we did in Budget 2021 ”.  Budget 2026 was designed to boost our economic resilience and protect jobs in a deeply uncertain international economic environment.  However, over recent years, the previous Government provided substantial income tax packages to support workers. The income tax measures implement over the period of the last Government are expected to be in line with wage growth (i.e. wages per head of 21.6 per cent). For example, the single standard rate band, which was increased by €8,700 or 24.6 per cent from €35,300 in 2020 to €44,000, with commensurate increases for jointly assessed married couples / civil partnerships and individuals who can avail of the increased band for single parents.  With the substantial personal Income Tax packages over the lifetime of the previous Government, significant progress has been made on increasing the entry point to the higher rate of income tax.  For this Budget the circumstances were different, and the Government had to make difficult choices. As has been done previously, when trade-offs have to be made due to limited resources or facing uncertainty, we did not implement changes to income tax credits and bands.  However, this was the first of five Budgets to be delivered by this Government, and the Government remains committed to, and will stand by, the Programme for Government commitment to make progressive changes to income tax, if the economy remains strong.

The Demographic Outlook paper notes that over the past several decades, global fertility rates have sharply declined in many regions across the world; reflecting a complex interaction of social, economic and health-related factors, alongside changing cultural norms regarding family size.  The report also notes that there is mixed evidence to suggest that pro-natalist policies help to slow declines in fertility rate, citing studies by the United Nations Population Fund (2020) and the OECD (2023).  Following the Demographic Outlook report, my Department published Future Forty: A Fiscal and Economic Outlook  to 2065 , in November. This report explored a wider range of key drivers of Ireland’s economy and public finances over the next forty years, on a no-policy change basis.  The two publications have highlighted how an ageing population, combined with a slowing economic growth and the cost of tackling climate change while accelerating the green transition will have considerable impacts on our public finances. In particular, the cost of health and long-term care services will rise, as will the cost of pensions, while there is a risk that Ireland will be unable to rely on exceptionally high levels corporation tax receipts in the medium-to-long term.  Key priorities to address these challenges include enhancing long-run productivity growth, particularly for domestic sectors; encouraging continued and efficient capital investment, both public and private, to address infrastructure deficits and increase the supply of housing; and taking a proactive and planned approach to digitalisation, to enhance productivity, while investing in skills to minimise potential negative impacts.  My Department has not undertaken any specific analysis with respect to reforming the Irish tax system to incentivise or support an increasing in total fertility rates. However, the Department will continue to review and assess evidence and analysis undertaken in areas relating to demographics, population ageing and fertility rates as part of its broader role in supporting evidence-based policy making.  I note that the 2024 UN World Population Prospects highlights how, following the introduction of pro-natalist interventions, Hungary has observed small, initial increases in Total Fertility Rates (TFR). However, these increases have not reached the required replacement rate of 2.1 and the TFR now appears to be falling from a peak of 1.6.  This may reflect the ‘deadweight’ risk of pro-natalist policies whereby the policies encourage those already planning to have children to have them earlier but does not incentivise additional births or births in groups who were not planning to have children. Moreover, the cost of introducing such policies is substantial, with estimates that they equate to approximately 5.5% of Hungary’s GDP annually. ",

Part 18 of the Local Government Act 2001, as amended, provides for the changing of placenames by local authorities. The adopting of a proposal to change a placename, the consideration of submissions in relation to such a proposal, and the decision to hold a ballot of qualified electors are reserved functions of the elected members.  Part 18 provides that Regulations can be made for the holding of plebiscites to change placenames. However, before Regulations could be made, issues were identified in respect of the interaction of the amended Part 18 of the Local Government Act 2001 and provisions contained in Official Languages legislation.  It is expected that a resolution to the legislative complexities that exist between the Local Government Acts and Official Languages Act may require primary legislation to resolve. The matter will be considered further by my Department in consultation with the relevant officials from the Department of Rural and Community Development and the Gaeltacht. There are a number of policy decisions that will have to be finalised between both Departments, and considered by Government, particularly in relation to the role of the Council and the role of the Minister with responsibility for the Official Languages Act and the Placenames Commission.  Work will continue with the Department of Rural and Community Development and the Gaeltacht on the resolution of the placenames issue, with a view to agreeing revised policy and identification of any required legislative change.

      "question": {
        "answerText": " Minister for Justice, Home Affairs and Migration  It is a central priority for me that Ireland’s immigration system is robust, and rules based. The enforcement aspects of our laws, including deportation orders, are an essential requirement for the system to work effectively and to ensure that there is confidence in the application of our legislation in this area.  Deportations are costly and complex to enforce. It is the preferred option to return people voluntarily and my Department has a voluntary return programme to assist people to return prior to the issuance of a deportation order. A person can only avail of voluntary return before a deportation order is issued and I have increased resources into this programme to enable people who wish to return before a deportation order is issued to them.  In 2024, 934 people left Ireland by way of voluntary return. This year 1,496 people have left Ireland by way of voluntary return up to 05 December 2025, which is an increase of 78% compared to the same period in 2024.  A deportation order is a legal order to leave the State. If a person does not remove themselves from the State following the issuance of a deportation order, they will be removed, and my Department has taken action to significantly improve immigration enforcement measures and increase removals. The number of deportation orders signed in 2024 (2,403) increased by 180% compared to 2023 (857). This year 4,454 deportation orders have been signed up to 05 December 2025.  So far in 2025, six charter flight operations have removed 205 people from the State. Of these, five operations to non-EU destinations removed 182 people who were subject to deportation orders and one operation removed 23 EU citizens on grounds of criminality.  Any person who has been ordered to leave the State and fails to do so is committing a criminal offence, and can be arrested without warrant if they come into contact with An Garda Síochána. Such an order remains on the person’s record permanently, unless revoked by the Minister for Justice – it means they may not enter Ireland again in future.  A person who is the subject of a deportation order may be detained for up to 56 days for the purpose of ensuring their deportation from the State.  The prescribed places of detention for this purpose are contained in the Immigration Act 1999 (Deportation) Regulations 2005 and are: Castlerea Prison, Cloverhill Prison, Cork Prison, Limerick Prison, Midlands Prison, Mountjoy Prison, and Wheatfield Prison, as well as all Garda Síochána stations. However, not all of these locations are used for this purpose.  I can advise the Deputy that of the 344 individuals whose deportation orders have been enforced by GNIB so far in 2025, 267 were detained prior to deportation. Of this group, 28 had criminal convictions.  I can further advise that of the 267 people who were detained for the purposes of deportation this year up to 28 November, 206 were detained in Cloverhill Prison, 24 in Mountjoy Female Prison, 16 in Cork prison, 10 in Limerick prison, seven in Castlerea Prison, three in Midlands prison and one in Dublin Airport Garda Station.  I have been advised by the Garda Commissioner that the number of people arrested in each year from 2020 - 2025 on foot of a deportation order is as follows:     Year    Number of people arrested  on foot of a Deportation Order      2020    72      2021    <10      2022    31      2023    69      2024    159      2025    318*     * (1) Year to date up to 24th October 2025 and (2) not all persons who are arrested on foot of a Deportation Order may be immediately removed due to legal or other logistical issues.  ** During the COVID- 19 Pandemic there was a moratorium on deportations. This was effective during the latter part of 2020, 2021 and for the first 8 months of 2022. During the moratorium only persons who whose presence in Ireland would be contrary to the public interest were deported. This moratorium was lifted in July 2022. ",

The granting of Irish citizenship through naturalisation is governed by the provisions of the Irish Nationality and Citizenship Act 1956, as amended. All applications for a certificate of naturalisation are processed and assessed individually in accordance with the provisions of the Act.  All applicants are required to satisfy the good character criterion under Section 15 of the Irish Nationality and Citizenship Act 1956 as amended.  As part of the naturalisation application, an applicant is required to detail all offences, regardless of where an incident occurred, or how long ago, and including “spent” convictions. The Act does not provide that having a criminal offence in itself prohibits the granting of naturalisation.  All adult applicants must undertake the Gardaí e-vetting process or other police vetting processes as deemed necessary. The details of offences listed in the e-vetting report(s) will be cross referenced with the information provided by the applicant during the initial application submission.  As part of the good character assessment, An Garda Síochána is requested to make enquiries into the applicant’s background; the detail and extent of which is a matter for An Garda Síochána. For sound security and operational reasons, it is not the practice to comment on the enquiries that may be conducted.  Should any relevant information be reported to my Department it will be associated to that person's naturalisation application. My Department does not collate statistics on the number of people granted naturalisation whose application contained a report regarding a criminal offence, such as where the offence is minor and occurred some time ago.  I recently received Government approval to make legislative change in this area and among the measures I will be taking is to clearly define what constitutes “good character” in the naturalisation process. This will clarify the application process for applicants, and the decision-making process for officials.  Detailed information on how to apply for naturalisation and other resources is available on my Department’s Immigration website here: www.irishimmigration.ie/how-to-become-a-citizen/ ",

        "answerText": " Minister for Education and Youth  My department’s main responsibility is to ensure that schools in an area can, between them, cater for all pupils seeking school places in the area.  Parents have the right to choose which school to apply to and where the school has places available for the relevant year, the student should be admitted. However, in schools where there are more applicants than places available, a selection process will be necessary. This selection process and the enrolment policy on which it is based must be non-discriminatory and must be applied fairly in respect of all applicants. However, this may result in some students not obtaining a place in the school of their first choice.  In accordance with the provisions of the Education (Admission to Schools) Act 2018, schools are required to clearly set out their selection criteria in their admission policies. The criteria to be applied by schools and the order of priority are a matter for the schools themselves. It is an important feature of the act that schools can only make a decision on an application for admission that is based on the school’s admission policy.  The Apply to School pilot was introduced to simplify and improve the admissions process for post-primary schools in five pilot areas, including Tullamore. This new system provides families, for the first time, with a single online application and introduces synchronised, streamlined timelines for schools to manage admissions, issue offers, and update a central database to record accepted places.  I wish to advise the Deputy that schools continue to operate in line with the Education (Admission to Schools) Act 2018 and their own Admissions Policies. Under this process, some applicants may receive more than one offer, while others may not receive an offer until later in the process. The centralised system helps identify duplicate acceptances and supports families in achieving certainty on school places earlier.  As part of this process, a second round of offers will be issued on 4 December. This ensures that any places that become available after the first round are allocated fairly and that every child is considered.  I want to reassure parents that there are sufficient first-year places in each pilot area for local children seeking a place. The Department will closely monitor the outcomes of the admissions process to ensure that all local children are accommodated and to identify any required solutions if necessary. The Apply to School pilot will provide early clarity and robust data to support this commitment.  Under Section 29 of the Education Act 1998, the parent of the student, or in the case of a student who has reached the age of 18 years, the student, may appeal a decision of this school to refuse admission. An appeal may be made under Section 29 (1)(c)(i) of the Education Act 1998 where the refusal to admit was due to the school being oversubscribed.  TUSLA’s Education Support Service (TESS) is the statutory agency that can assist parents who are experiencing difficulty in securing a school place for their child.  Contact details for TESS are available at the following link www.tusla.ie/tess/get-in-touch/ or by email at tessinfo@tusla.ie. ",

        "answerText": " Minister for Social Protection  The introduction of a pensions auto-enrolment system is a Programme for Government commitment, and one of my key priorities. The aim of introducing an Automatic Enrolment (AE) system is to address the pension coverage gap that exists in Ireland, and to help provide for better retirement incomes for workers. The new system will be called 'My Future Fund' and it will launch from the 1st January 2026.  My Department has evidence that some employers intend enrolling their employees into occupational pension schemes at rates lower than those provided for in the Automatic Enrolment Retirement Savings Act (2024) in order to ensure that the employees concerned are not automatically enrolled into the My Future Fund scheme. In the normal course of events, if such employees were being offered the same pension terms and benefits of other members already in the employer scheme, this might be a welcome development. However, I understand that in some cases the employees concerned are being compelled to join the scheme, including in circumstances where membership is not explicitly required under their contract of employment. I also understand that payments into these pension scheme consist solely of an employer contribution of about 1% of salary. Such a low contribution level is less than 30% of the initial contributions payable under the My Future Fund scheme and less than 10% of those that will ultimately be payable under that scheme. Such contributions are essentially a nominal contribution that is unlikely to yield any material pension benefit.  In order to address these concerns, I intend to exercise my powers under Section 52 of the AE Act to prescribe standards in relation to the levels of contributions by employers and employees to current occupational pensions, which will exempt an employment from My Future Fund. These standards are being considered by the National Automatic Enrolment Retirement Savings Authority in consultation with the Pensions Authority. These regulations will be finalised shortly, at which point the standards in relation to contribution rates will be made publicly available.  I hope this clarifies matters for the Deputy. ",

Ireland’s total ODA for 2024 was €2.35 billion, or €1.72 billion, if ODA-eligible support for Ukrainian refugees in their first year in Ireland is excluded.  Our bilateral development assistance is delivered in our partner countries and other vulnerable locations worldwide. The G20 represents the world’s major economies, and only eight of the member countries are on the OECD list of countries eligible to receive Official Development Assistance (ODA).  The most significant ODA contributions to the G20 countries relate to:  • climate financing, including our support to Instituto Socioambiental and Fundo Socioambiental Casa in Brazil in their work fight against environmental degradation (€1,000,000)  • support to Irish missionary organisations most notably in India, working to provide humanitarian assistance for vulnerable communities (€836,593)  • Ireland’s development programme in South Africa, which focuses on three main policy areas: health, education, and gender-based violence  The ODA relating to China refers to support to human rights organisations, rights issues associated with the extractive industries in Africa, and small grant funding via our Embassy in Beijing for a project on minority rights.  Amounts of bilateral ODA in 2024 to the G20 member countries are set out in tabular format below:      G20 Country      ODA Amount, €       Argentina    54,127      Australia    -      Brazil    1,299,254      Canada    -      China    26,246      France    -      Germany    -      India    864,509      Indonesia    81,386      Italy    -      Japan    -      Republic of Korea    -      Mexico    79,386      Russia    -      Saudi Arabia    -      South Africa    2,513,508      Türkiye    91,521      United Kingdom    -      United States of America    -      African Union*    600,000      European Union*    -       Grand Total - ODA to G20 Countries      5,609,937       ",

        "answerText": " Minister for Education and Youth  The Department is committed to providing funding to recognised primary and post-primary schools in the Free Education Scheme by way of per capita grants. The two main grants are the capitation grant to cater for day-to-day running costs such as heating, lighting, cleaning, insurance and general up-keep, and the ancillary grant to cater for the cost of employing ancillary services staff. Schools have the flexibility to use capitation funding provided for general running costs and ancillary funding provided for caretaking and secretarial services as a common grant from which the Board of Management can allocate according to its own priorities, except for the employment of relevant secretaries as per Circular 0036/2022.  The Government is committed to increasing funding to support schools and the Programme for Government commits to increasing capitation funding to schools of all types to ensure that schools can meet the elevated day-to-day running costs.  The commitment in the Programme for Government builds on the progress which has been made in recent years. The Department has secured €39 million in Budget 2026 towards increased capitation funding for primary, post-primary and special schools to provide additional financial support towards their running costs. This will see an increase in the standard capitation rates paid to schools of €50 per pupil for primary schools from €224 to €274 and of €20 per student for post-primary schools from €386 to €406. This will also allow for an increase of €20 in capitation rates for Urban Band One DEIS primary schools, increasing the mainstream pupil rate in these schools to €294. The increased capitation rates will also see special schools now receive the same rates of mainstream capitation, for young people aged 12 and over, as for their peers in mainstream post-primary schools. These increases will take effect from September 2026. This funding will benefit schools around the country in managing their day-to-day running costs.  The current standard rate of capitation grant is €224 per pupil in primary schools and €386 per student in post-primary schools. Primary schools with fewer than 60 pupils are paid the capitation and the ancillary grants on the basis of having 60 pupils. Enhanced rates are also paid in respect of pupils with special educational needs and Traveller pupils.  The Department of Education is aware that costs and funding can be a source of concern for schools, and is constantly working to address this matter, and to enhance the financial and other supports available to schools.  Schools in financial difficulty are encouraged to contact my Department for advice and support. The Department is committed to offering all available and appropriate supports to schools, which may include an advance in capitation grant funding or other measures.  The Department is constantly engaging with a number of schools in this respect. Schools that have contacted the Department have been referred to the Financial Support Services Unit (FSSU). We encourage schools to engage with the FSSU, and the school’s Patron, in order to work to rectify any financial challenges at the school.  In May 2024, at the request of Schools Division Financial Section, the FSSU engaged with the school referred to, to offer support. ",

        "answerText": " Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage  The overarching objectives of the Regulation (EU) 2024/900 on the transparency and targeting of political advertising is to provide for a harmonised approach throughout the European Union in relation to the transparency and targeting of political advertising. In broad terms, the Regulation aims to make it easier for voters to recognise political advertisements, to understand who is behind them and to know whether they have received a targeted advertisement, so that they are better placed to make informed choices during elections and referendums.  Under the Regulation, each political advertisement must be labelled and must come with a transparency notice, which will include information on who sponsored the advert; how much was spent on the advert or campaign; the source of funds behind the advert; the targeting criteria (if any); the advert dissemination period; and reach metrics. The Regulation entered into full force and became directly applicable in all Member States of the European Union on 10 October 2025.  The European Union (Political Advertising) Regulations 2025 (S.I. No. 474 of 2025), which were made under section 3 of the European Communities Act 1972, facilitate the implementation in Ireland of Regulation (EU) 2024/900 on the transparency and targeting of political advertising. In summary, the national regulations provide for:  • the designation of An Coimisiún Toghcháin as Ireland’s national contact point;  • the designation of Coimisiún na Meán as the competent authority to supervise the compliance of the following entities with the obligations under Articles 7 to 17 of the Regulation –  the providers of intermediary services,  providers of audio-visual media services (as defined in section 2 of the Broadcasting Act 2009),  providers of a sound broadcasting service (as defined in section 2 of the Broadcasting Act 2009),  providers of online services designated under section 139E of the Broadcasting Act 2009, and  hosting service providers within the meaning of the Terrorist Content Online Regulation;  • the designation of An Coimisiún Toghcháin as the competent authority to supervise the compliance of all other entities with their obligations under the Regulation;  • assigning the Data Protection Commission as the competent authority for Articles 18 and 19 of the Regulation (i.e. the targeting provisions);  • the sanctions which may be applied by a competent authority in the event that an infringement of Regulation (EU) 2024/900 takes place; and  • the repeal of Part 4 of the Electoral Reform Act 2022 and section 140 of the Electoral Act 1992 respectively.  In accordance with the requirements of Regulation (EU) 2024/900, the European Union (Political Advertising) Regulations 2025 commenced on 10 October 2025.  Over the course of the development of the national regulations, my Department engaged with An Coimisiún Toghcháin, Coimisiún na Meán, the Data Protection Commission, the Department of Culture, Communications and Sport and the Department of Justice, Home Affairs and Migration having particular regard to the designation of competent authorities and the functions assigned to them.  Part 4 of the Electoral Reform Act 2022 provided a regulatory framework to ensure transparency in respect of online political advertisements purchased for placement, display, promotion or dissemination during electoral periods. During electoral periods, the provisions of Part 4 required paid-for online political advertisements to be clearly labelled as ‘political adverts’ and to be accompanied by a transparency notice setting out specified information for the recipients of such advertisements. It also provided that An Coimisiún Toghcháin would be the relevant authority responsible for enforcing the provisions.  Against this background, Article 1 of Regulation (EU) 2024/900 lays down harmonised rules in respect of transparency of political advertising, the due diligence requirements on sponsors and political advertising providers, on the targeting of political advertising and on supervision and enforcement. Part 4 of the Electoral Reform Act 2022 (and section 140 of the Electoral Act 1992) was repealed on the grounds that its provisions did not comply with the harmonised provisions set out in the Regulation. Key differences between the Regulation and Part 4 include:  • the scope of the Regulation is not confined solely to online political advertising, it applies to political advertising across all media;  • Part 4 was intended to apply to paid political advertising only. The Regulation also applies to political advertising developed in-house by political parties and candidates;  • the requirements of Regulation (EU) apply to sponsors and to entities throughout the political advertising value chain while the requirements of Part 4 were only intended to apply to the purchasers of online political advertising and to online platforms;  • Part 4 did not place any restrictions on the use of targeting or amplification techniques, it simply required that the use of such measures be declared on a transparency notice. The Regulation prohibits the use of sensitive personal information for the purpose of targeting political advertising; and  • the enforcement provisions under Part 4 assigned An Coimisiún Toghcháin as the sole competent authority while the enforcement provisions in the Regulation explicitly provides roles for each Member State's Digital Services Coordinator (for intermediary service providers) and data protection authority (for the targeting provisions) as well as for other competent authorities in respect of the obligations on other entities.

However, the International Protection Act 2015, Section 21(2)(a) provides that an application for international protection is inadmissible where one or more of the following circumstances applies in relation to the person who is the subject of the application:  * Another member State has granted refugee status or subsidiary protection status to the person;  * A country other than a Member State is, in accordance with Section 21(15) of the 2015 Act, a first country of asylum for the person;  * The person arrived in the State from a safe third country that is, in accordance with Subsection 17, a safe country for the person.  Following the withdrawal of the UK from the EU, a new arrangement for reciprocal returns of international protection applicants between Ireland and the UK was agreed. However a High Court judgment subsequently identified legal issues with the process concerning the designation in Irish law of safe third countries.  The issues raised by the judgment were addressed by the Courts, Civil Law, Criminal Law and Superannuation (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2024 and, following an analysis required as under the Act, I designated the UK as a safe third country for returns under S.I. No. 73/2025 - International Protection Act 2015 (Safe Third Country) Order 2025 with effect from 11 March 2025.  Arrangements for re-operationalising the agreement, on foot of the re- designation of the UK as a safe third country, are being put in place in consultation with the UK.  Ireland and the United Kingdom (UK) share a long history and common interest in the effective operation of the Common Travel Area (CTA) and work together to prevent any abuses of the CTA.  My Department chairs a CTA forum with the UK Home Office which acts as a steering committee for the ongoing work of protecting the CTA in relation to free movement of its citizens between both countries while at the same time ensuring that the CTA is not abused by those not entitled to avail of it. The Forum meets twice yearly but also meets in sub-group format to address particular elements of Ireland/UK co-operation, bringing together relevant subject matter expertise in areas such as asylum and border management.  More broadly, there is extensive engagement and cooperation at all levels between my Department officials and their Home Office counterparts, as well as significant operational cooperation between the Gardaí, UK Border Force, UK policing services and the Police Service of Northern Ireland. This strong practical engagement and cooperation serves the mutual interests of both Ireland and the UK and will continue. ",

        "answerText": " Minister for Education and Youth  Officials from the Department's emergency works team have been in contact with the school today, 26 November, to assist them in submitting an emergency works application to deal with the school boiler. The school has been advised of next steps in terms of an emergency works application.  As the Deputy maybe aware, the purpose of the Emergency Works Scheme (EWS) is to provide funding specifically for unforeseen emergencies, or to provide funding to facilitate inclusion and access for pupils with special needs. It does so by ensuring the availability of funding for urgent works to those schools that are in need of resources as a result of an emergency situation.  An emergency is deemed to be a situation which poses an immediate risk to health, life, property or the environment, which is sudden, unforeseen and requires immediate action, and in the case of a school, if not corrected would prevent the school or part thereof from opening.  The EWS operates on the basis of a minimal scope works to address the emergency situation.  The EWS is intended to remedy an emergency situation and usually provides only an interim measure until a permanent solution can be delivered under the Summer Works Scheme (SWS) which deals with upgrade works to the school. The EWS is open to primary and post primary schools with permanent recognition and in non-rented accommodation.  In relation to the school's application under the Climate Action Summer Works Scheme (CASWS), the first tranche of approvals under the new Climate Action Summer Works Scheme were announced earlier in November. Given that funding is limited in any particular year it is necessary to prioritise applications. Under the new climate action summer works scheme which operates on a multi-annual basis , like previous summer works schemes, applications from schools that are not reached for funding or market prioritisation reasons (as above) in 2026 will qualify to be assessed for purposes of the funding available for climate action summer works in subsequent years ",

My Department is taking all necessary steps to manage the international protection process efficiently and effectively, while ensuring the integrity of those processes is maintained at all times.  There are a number of circumstances where a person might apply at the International Protection Office (IPO) without first applying at a port of entry. They may enter at an airport with valid documentation for example but choose not to apply at that time. Or they may apply having been in the State for a period previously, for example on foot of a different permission to remain.  My Department’s assessment, based on the experience of staff and others working in the field, and based on the material gathered at interviews, is that in a significant proportion of cases, those applying for the first time in the IPO have entered over the land border. Details on the route travelled to Ireland are recorded as part of the applicants file at the IPO, but are not stored in a manner which allows detailed data to be extracted in the manner sought by the Deputy.

Ireland and the United Kingdom (UK) share a long history and common interest in the effective operation of the Common Travel Area (CTA) and work together to prevent any abuses of the CTA.  There is also significant operational cooperation between the Gardaí, UK Border Force, UK policing services and the Police Service of Northern Ireland in relation to both immigration and criminal matters. This strong practical engagement and cooperation serves the mutual interests of both Ireland and the UK, and will continue.  In relation to the inadmissibility process, the International Protection Act 2015, Section 21(2)(a) provides that an application for international protection is inadmissible where one or more of the following circumstances applies in relation to the person who is the subject of the application:  • Another member State has granted refugee status or subsidiary protection status to the person;  • A country other than a Member State is, in accordance with Section 21(15) of the 2015 Act, a first country of asylum for the person;  • The person arrived in the State from a safe third country that is, in accordance with Subsection 17, a safe country for the person.  Prior to the UK leaving the EU, returns to the UK were governed under the EU Regulations. The UK was the primary destination country for people transferred from Ireland under these Regulations. In 2019 of the 35 people transferred, 33 were sent to the UK, in 2020 of the 8 people transferred, 7 were to the UK.  Following the withdrawal of the UK, a new arrangement for reciprocal returns of international protection applicants between Ireland and the UK was agreed. However a High Court judgment subsequently identified legal issues with the process concerning the designation in Irish law of safe third countries.  The issues raised by the judgment were addressed by the Courts, Civil Law, Criminal Law and Superannuation (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2024 and, following an analysis required as under the Act, I designated the UK as a safe third country for returns under S.I. No. 73/2025 - International Protection Act 2015 (Safe Third Country) Order 2025 with effect from 11 March 2025.  Arrangements for re-operationalising the agreement, on foot of the re- designation of the UK as a safe third country, are being put in place in consultation with the UK.  As no return orders were issued during the Covid pandemic and due to the litigation challenges outlined above, only one return order has been signed for a UK inadmissible applicant during this recent period.

My Department is taking all necessary steps to manage the international protection process efficiently and effectively, while ensuring the integrity of those processes is maintained at all times.  There are a number of circumstances where a person might apply at the International Protection Office (IPO) without first applying at a port of entry. They may enter at an airport with valid documentation for example but choose not to apply at that time. Or they may apply having been in the State for a period previously, for example on foot of a different permission to remain.  My Department’s assessment, based on the experience of staff and others working in the field, and based on the material gathered at interviews, is that in a significant proportion of cases, those applying for the first time in the IPO have entered over the land border. Details on the route travelled to Ireland are recorded as part of the applicants file at the IPO, but are not stored in a manner which allows detailed data to be extracted in the manner sought by the Deputy.  The below table provides a yearly breakdown of IP applications and the location the claim was made.

Ireland and the United Kingdom (UK) share a long history and common interest in the effective operation of the Common Travel Area (CTA) and work together to prevent any abuses of the CTA.  There is also significant operational cooperation between the Gardaí, UK Border Force, UK policing services and the Police Service of Northern Ireland in relation to both immigration and criminal matters. This strong practical engagement and cooperation serves the mutual interests of both Ireland and the UK, and will continue.  In relation to the inadmissibility process, the International Protection Act 2015, Section 21(2)(a) provides that an application for international protection is inadmissible where one or more of the following circumstances applies in relation to the person who is the subject of the application:  • Another member State has granted refugee status or subsidiary protection status to the person;  • A country other than a Member State is, in accordance with Section 21(15) of the 2015 Act, a first country of asylum for the person;  • The person arrived in the State from a safe third country that is, in accordance with Subsection 17, a safe country for the person.  Prior to the UK leaving the EU, returns to the UK were governed under the EU Regulations. The UK was the primary destination country for people transferred from Ireland under these Regulations. In 2019 of the 35 people transferred, 33 were sent to the UK, in 2020 of the 8 people transferred, 7 were to the UK.  Following the withdrawal of the UK, a new arrangement for reciprocal returns of international protection applicants between Ireland and the UK was agreed. However a High Court judgment subsequently identified legal issues with the process concerning the designation in Irish law of safe third countries.  The issues raised by the judgment were addressed by the Courts, Civil Law, Criminal Law and Superannuation (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2024 and, following an analysis required as under the Act, I designated the UK as a safe third country for returns under S.I. No. 73/2025 - International Protection Act 2015 (Safe Third Country) Order 2025 with effect from 11 March 2025.  Arrangements for re-operationalising the agreement, on foot of the re- designation of the UK as a safe third country, are being put in place in consultation with the UK.  As no return orders were issued during the Covid pandemic and due to the litigation challenges outlined above, only one return order has been signed for a UK inadmissible applicant during this recent period.

        "answerText": " Minister for Justice, Home Affairs and Migration  I propose to take Questions Nos. 230, 231 and 232 together.  My Department is taking all necessary steps to manage the international protection process efficiently and effectively, while ensuring the integrity of those processes is maintained at all times.  Regulation (EU) No 604/2013 (Dublin III Regulations), came into force on 19 July 2013, and lays down the criteria and mechanisms for determining which EU country is responsible for examining an asylum application. The Dublin Regulation is based on the principle that the first Member State to facilitate entry to the EU should be responsible for examining the protection application.  A decision to transfer made under the Dublin III Regulations expires after six months. This extends to 18 months if the applicant has absconded. If an appeal is launched, a Dublin III decision expires six months from the date the appeal decision is given.  In practice, and in keeping with the experience of other Member States, effective implementation of the Dublin Regulation is challenging. Member States have found significant problems with the Dublin Regulation, including the lack of consistent implementation across the Member States and that shortcomings with the design of the Regulation makes it difficult to achieve its main objectives.  In advance of a transfer, it is necessary to inform the receiving State of the transfer and make the arrangements to transfer the person in the specific notification periods for each EU Member State. The notification periods range from 3 working days to the majority of EU Member States requiring at least 7 working days. Earlier this year I increased the permissible detention period to facilitate a transfer under the Regulations from 7 to 42 days, with the intention being to give the Garda National Immigration Bureau more capacity to make the required arrangements in advance of the transfer being effected.  Ireland has opted in to the EU Asylum and Migration Pact which is due to enter operation in June 2026. The Pact will provide a fair, sustainable and efficient asylum procedure. This will be achieved through convergence in asylum practices across the EU.  One of the major benefits for Ireland of the Pact is that it replaces the Dublin III Regulation with a more efficient and streamlined process.  The Asylum and Migration Management Regulation (AMMR) which will replace the Dublin III Regulation, provides for, among other things, streamlined criteria and reduced timeframes for determining the Member State responsible for determining an asylum application as well as revised rules on transferring responsibility and addressing evasion.  This will significantly improve the current system by reducing the administrative burden on the Member States seeking to transfer a person to the Member State. It will also extend the period by which a transfer must be carried out from 18 months to 3 years.

        "answerText": " Minister for Justice, Home Affairs and Migration  I propose to take Questions Nos. 230, 231 and 232 together.  My Department is taking all necessary steps to manage the international protection process efficiently and effectively, while ensuring the integrity of those processes is maintained at all times.  Regulation (EU) No 604/2013 (Dublin III Regulations), came into force on 19 July 2013, and lays down the criteria and mechanisms for determining which EU country is responsible for examining an asylum application. The Dublin Regulation is based on the principle that the first Member State to facilitate entry to the EU should be responsible for examining the protection application.  A decision to transfer made under the Dublin III Regulations expires after six months. This extends to 18 months if the applicant has absconded. If an appeal is launched, a Dublin III decision expires six months from the date the appeal decision is given.  In practice, and in keeping with the experience of other Member States, effective implementation of the Dublin Regulation is challenging. Member States have found significant problems with the Dublin Regulation, including the lack of consistent implementation across the Member States and that shortcomings with the design of the Regulation makes it difficult to achieve its main objectives.  In advance of a transfer, it is necessary to inform the receiving State of the transfer and make the arrangements to transfer the person in the specific notification periods for each EU Member State. The notification periods range from 3 working days to the majority of EU Member States requiring at least 7 working days. Earlier this year I increased the permissible detention period to facilitate a transfer under the Regulations from 7 to 42 days, with the intention being to give the Garda National Immigration Bureau more capacity to make the required arrangements in advance of the transfer being effected.  Ireland has opted in to the EU Asylum and Migration Pact which is due to enter operation in June 2026. The Pact will provide a fair, sustainable and efficient asylum procedure. This will be achieved through convergence in asylum practices across the EU.  One of the major benefits for Ireland of the Pact is that it replaces the Dublin III Regulation with a more efficient and streamlined process.  The Asylum and Migration Management Regulation (AMMR) which will replace the Dublin III Regulation, provides for, among other things, streamlined criteria and reduced timeframes for determining the Member State responsible for determining an asylum application as well as revised rules on transferring responsibility and addressing evasion.  This will significantly improve the current system by reducing the administrative burden on the Member States seeking to transfer a person to the Member State. It will also extend the period by which a transfer must be carried out from 18 months to 3 years.  The table below shows the number of Dublin III transfer decisions issued by the IPO for international protection applicants from 2019 to 14 November 2025.

Deputy Carol Nolan asked the Minister for Justice, Home Affairs and Migration to clarify the opt-out options that were, and remain, available to Ireland with respect to the EU Migration and Asylum Pact; which of those opt-out options the State decided not to avail of, and the reason; and if he will make a statement on the matter. [66370/25] ",
        "answerText": " Minister for Justice, Home Affairs and Migration  Ireland has opted in to the EU Asylum and Migration Pact which will come into effect in June 2026. The Pact will provide a fair, sustainable and efficient asylum procedure. This will be achieved through convergence in asylum practices across the EU, and through the introduction of streamlined and faster processing times.  The Pact recognises that migration is a challenge experienced across the European Union, which requires sharing of responsibility, robust and fair management of external borders, and stronger governance of asylum and migration policies. Migration is inherently a transnational issue and the reality is that no country can deal with the challenges of migration alone.  It is for this reason that Ireland is already part of the Common European asylum system, and the Pact is a reform of this common EU system. The European Union has competence in the area of Freedom, Security and Justice (which includes asylum) under Part 3 of Title V of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU), which was ratified by Ireland with the prior approval of the people in the referendum on the Twenty-Eighth Amendment of the Constitution (Treaty of Lisbon) Act 2009.  Under Protocol 21 to the TFEU (Protocol (No. 21) on the position of the United Kingdom and Ireland in respect of the Area of Freedom, Security, and Justice), inserted by the Treaty of Lisbon, Ireland does not automatically participate in and is not bound by measures in the area of freedom, security and justice. However, Ireland is entitled to opt into such measures on a case-by-case basis. Such opt-ins are exercised on foot of a Government decision and after approval by both Houses of the Oireachtas, in accordance with Article 29.4.7° iii of the Constitution.  Ireland has been and is today significantly integrated into migration and asylum policy at the European level. Ireland already participates in the Common European Asylum System and has opted in to and given effect in Irish law to earlier EU measures in this area, including the 2001 Temporary Protection Directive, the 2004 Qualifications Directive, the 2005 Asylum Procedures Directive, the Dublin III Regulation, the 2013 Eurodac Regulation, and the 2013 Reception Conditions Directive. Ireland has also opted in to the Regulation establishing an EU Agency for Asylum (EUAA).  Ireland has now opted into seven of the Pact measures. These were:  • Directive (EU) 2024/1346: Reception Conditions Directive (recast)  • Regulation (EU) 2024/1347: Asylum Qualification Regulation  • Regulation (EU) 2024/1348: Asylum Procedure Regulation  • Regulation (EU) 2024/1350: EU Resettlement Framework Regulation  • Regulation (EU) 2024/1351: Asylum and Migration Management Regulation  • Regulation (EU) 2024/1358: Eurodac Regulation  • Regulation (EU) 2024/1359: Crisis and Force Majeure Regulation.  There are two Schengen measures that Ireland cannot opt into, as Ireland does not participate fully in the Schengen acquis . These two measures are:  • Regulation (EU) 2024/1356: Screening Regulation  • Regulation (EU) 2024/1349: Return Border Procedure Regulation  Ireland is however, planning to align appropriately in national law, through the International Protection Bill, with both of those measures.  It is important to note that Ireland was heavily involved in the negotiation process at official and Ministerial level to ensure that Irish interests were reflected in the Pact measures. Ireland’s representatives in the European Parliament also had the opportunity to examine and vote on the Pact in April 2024.  My Department continues to focus on preparing for the EU Pact on Migration and Asylum in advance of the measures coming into effect in June 2026.  The General Scheme of a new International Protection Bill to give effect to the measures of the EU Migration and Asylum Pact was approved by Government on 29 April 2025. The General Scheme has been published and underwent pre-legislative scrutiny at the Oireachtas Committee on Justice, Home Affairs and Migration last month. The drafting of the Bill is well underway. It is expected that the Bill will be published by the end of the year. Enactment of the Bill and commencement of the Act is required by 11 June 2026. ",

The costs associated with the Department's participation at the COP30 conference are not yet finalised. Once all financial matters related to COP30 are closed, I will be happy to furnish full details from the Department. In relation to the Department’s estimated carbon footprint or carbon cost related to attending the conference, this is a matter that officials will review in the weeks following COP, and again I will be happy to furnish further details as and when this information becomes available.  It has not been possible to collate complete information for the COP conferences in the years 2022, 2023 and 2024 as requested by the Deputy in the time allowed. I will, however, make arrangements to reply to the Deputy in line with Standing Orders once the information is to hand. ",
