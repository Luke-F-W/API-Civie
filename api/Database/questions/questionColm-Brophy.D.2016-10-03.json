        "answerText": " Minister for Finance  The Research and Development (R&D) corporation tax credit is a strategically important element of Ireland’s overall support for research and development activities. Irish R&D supports form part of a suite of measures that ensures Ireland remains an attractive location for both domestic and inward investment.  Ireland has successfully created a globally competitive innovation hub, and the R&D tax credit has played a large part in that success. Multinational firms in Ireland support thousands of Irish jobs, Irish companies and Irish education institutions. This is particularly encouraging for regional economies, with sectoral clustering evident, leading to significant benefits for local economies, business communities and third level institutions.  As part of Finance Act (No. 2) 2023 the rate of the R&D tax credit was increased from 25% to 30%. This increase in the R&D corporation tax credit rate preserved the net benefit of the credit for companies within the scope of Pillar Two.  It also provided an increased support to companies (including micro and small sized companies) not subject to the new minimum tax rules thus encouraging increased engagement with the regime.  This year Finance Bill 2024 will increase the first year payment threshold from €50,000 to €75,000. This threshold is the amount up to which a claim can be paid in full in the first year, rather than paid in instalments over three years. These changes will provide a cash-flow benefit for smaller research & development projects and to encourage more companies to engage with the regime while maintaining the government’s focus on enterprise supports, to support productive and innovative businesses in the state.  I am advised by Revenue that the estimated cost of increasing the research and development tax credit by 5% and 10% is €230 million and €460 million respectively. These figures are based on 2022 data, where the credit was at 25% and there was a large increase in the Exchequer cost that year, which is expected to have arisen in part due to the restructuring of the credit in that year to meet new global standards for refundable tax credits, which resulted in a one-off acceleration of some payments into 2022.  The R&D credit is a demand-led support and the annual cost fluctuates over time as a result of company R&D cycles.

        "answerText": " Minister for Education  My Department is committed to providing funding to recognised primary and post-primary schools in the free education scheme by way of per capita grants. The two main grants are the Capitation grant to cater for day-to-day running costs such as heating, lighting, cleaning, insurance and general up-keep, and the Ancillary grant to cater for the cost of employing ancillary services staff. Schools have the flexibility to use capitation funding provided for general running costs and ancillary funding provided for caretaking and secretarial services as a common grant from which the Board of Management can allocate according to its own priorities, except for cases where a secretary is now paid from my Department’s payroll as per Circular 0036/2022.  The current standard rate of Capitation grant is €200 per pupil in primary schools and €345 per student in post-primary schools.  Primary schools with fewer than 60 pupils are paid the Capitation and the Ancillary grants on the basis of having 60 pupils. At post-primary level, schools with fewer than 200 students receive ancillary-related grants on the basis of having 200 students.  As part of the capitation package in Budget 2025 I am pleased to have secured over €30 million as a permanent increase in capitation funding to assist schools now and longer term with increased day-to-day running costs. This represents an increase of circa 12% on current standard rates and enhanced rates. This increase is on top of the circa 9.2% increase from last year’s budget. This will bring the standard rate of Capitation grant to the level of €224 per pupil in primary schools and €386 per student in post-primary schools from September 2025. Enhanced rates will also be paid in respect of pupils with special educational needs and Traveller pupils.  In addition to these grants, €45 million in cost of living supports will issue in 2024, to support all recognised primary and post-primary schools in the free education scheme. This additional funding announced in Budget 2025 is designed to assist schools with increased day-to-day running costs such as heating and electricity. Schools should also ensure that they are availing of the available OGP procurement frameworks and getting best value for money for all school expenditure.

Allocations are provided to schools on the basis of the school's overall profile of need. As a result, the number of students supported by SNAs varies from school to school.  When the NCSE allocates a SNA post, the board of management as the employer, is responsible for filling the vacancy. The decision on whether to employ a full time SNA to fill a full-time post or to employ an equivalent number of part time SNAs rests with the employer. Therefore data on the number of SNAs employed is held at a local level.  The NCSE publish their allocation of SNA posts annually on their website. For ease of reference these allocations are broken down by county and school type. This data is available at the following link: SET Hours and SNA Allocations – National Council for Special Education – Working to deliver a better special education service.  We have been steadily building on the number of SNAs in our education system. At the end of the 2023 school year there was just over 21,000 SNAs in schools, double the number there were in 2011. Budget 2024 provided for 1,216 new SNA posts and Budget 2025 for a further 1,600.  This increase provided in budget 2025 represents an increase of approximately 128% in the number of SNAs provided since 2011 at which point 10,320 SNAs were available.  The NCSE have provided details of the number of SNAs posts allocated to primary, post primary and special schools since 2011 and these are set out in the table below.

        "answerText": " Minister of State at the Department of Education  Enabling children with special educational needs to receive an education is a priority for this government. It is also a key priority for my department and for the National Council for Special Education (NCSE).  The vast majority of children with special educational needs are supported to attend mainstream classes with their peers. Where children with more complex needs require additional supports, special classes and special school places are provided.  The NCSE has the responsibility for planning and coordinating school supports for children with special educational needs. They have advised that in 2011 there were approximately 600 special classes nationwide. This figure has been substantially built on in recent years. There are now 3,337 special classes distributed in every county. Almost 1,700 of these new special classes have been sanctioned by the NCSE in the last 5 years. The attach document provides a breakdown of where these classes are located.  Over 400 of these classes have been sanctioned for this school year, 289 at primary level and 120 at post primary. Budget 2025 provides funding for another 400 special classes and 300 special school places next year. It is estimated that a similar level of provision will be needed each year for the next 3 years.  As demand for new special classes at post-primary level is expected to increase significantly over the next few years, due to increasing demographics and increasing prevalence rates, my department and the NCSE have engaged with post-primary stakeholders in relation to the provision of special classes.  In October 2022, my department wrote to all post-primary schools requesting that each school begin planning to provide for up to four special classes to meet the needs of children progressing from primary school. Just last month my department issued a circular to all schools setting out new measures to support the forward planning of special education provision. Included in this circular was a reminder of the need for post primary schools to continue planning for this level of provision.  The NCSE have recruited additional special education needs organisers (SENOs), advisors and team managers. A total of 120 SENOs now operate nationwide. SENOs play an important role in ensuring there is adequate special educational provision within local areas and are currently visiting schools nationwide to conduct planning meetings. These visits will be key in terms of forward planning for the 2025/26 school year.   Special classes by county  ",

These schools will be located in counties Cork, Dublin (2), Monaghan and Tipperary. The exact location, size of the schools and other details are currently being worked through.  These schools will provide for children and young people with complex special education needs up to 18 years of age. They are being sanctioned as early as possible as part of advanced forward planning for the next school year to ensure that appropriate placements are available where needed to meet the needs of students with special educational needs.  The announcement of these schools is a significant step forward. Part of the forward planning process looks at how far students are travelling to access an education appropriate to their needs. This is an important factor which has been incorporated into the decision making process. In addition, information held on the department's Geographical Information System (GIS), particularly in relation to student demographics and other statistical data also forms part of the process. NCSE knowledge of the need for special school places at local level is a key element also.  The early announcement of the new schools is an important milestone because it allows more time for the planning of school admissions, recruitment of staff, staff training and completion of necessary building works.  It is envisaged that existing buildings will be repurposed to facilitate the opening of the new special schools for the 2025/26 school year. Further details such as the precise location of the new schools in each county will be confirmed in due course as part of the finalisation of arrangements for the opening of the new special schools.  Dedicated working groups will be established to support the establishment of each of the new special schools.   Supported Special Schools  ",

        "answerText": " Minister for Education  I propose to take Questions Nos. 171 and 172 together.  Budget 2025 provides for an unprecedented €11.8 billion investment in education and schools, an increase of some 9 per cent on the same figure in Budget 2024.  Currently there are almost 88,000 teaching posts allocated across the primary and post-primary school system. This represents an increase of over 10,000 teachers when compared with the 2019/20 school year.  The key factor for determining the level of staffing resources provided at individual school level is the staffing schedule for the relevant school year and pupil enrolments on the previous 30 September.  Since I became Minister, I have prioritised reducing the pupil teacher ratios in primary schools. I reduced the allocation by one point in 2021, 2022 and 2023 and it now stands at an average of 1 classroom teacher for every 23 pupils, the lowest level ever seen at primary level. A three point reduction in the retention schedule, which I introduced in 2021, assists schools that would otherwise be at risk of losing teaching posts. I also improved teacher allocations for DEIS Urban Band 1 schools which now stand at an average of 17:1, 21:1 and 19:1 for junior, senior and vertical schools respectively.  The Statistics Section of my Department's website contains extensive data in relation to our schools. The latest statistics available are for the 2023/24 school year. The 2023/24 educational statistical report shows that the average pupil teacher ratio at primary level last year was 12.8:1, while the average class size was 22.5. These ratios, brought about by recent budget improvements, are the lowest averages across the last 20 years. ",

        "answerText": " Minister for Education  I propose to take Questions Nos. 171 and 172 together.  Budget 2025 provides for an unprecedented €11.8 billion investment in education and schools, an increase of some 9 per cent on the same figure in Budget 2024.  Currently there are almost 88,000 teaching posts allocated across the primary and post-primary school system. This represents an increase of over 10,000 teachers when compared with the 2019/20 school year.  The key factor for determining the level of staffing resources provided at individual school level is the staffing schedule for the relevant school year and pupil enrolments on the previous 30 September.  Since I became Minister, I have prioritised reducing the pupil teacher ratios in primary schools. I reduced the allocation by one point in 2021, 2022 and 2023 and it now stands at an average of 1 classroom teacher for every 23 pupils, the lowest level ever seen at primary level. A three point reduction in the retention schedule, which I introduced in 2021, assists schools that would otherwise be at risk of losing teaching posts. I also improved teacher allocations for DEIS Urban Band 1 schools which now stand at an average of 17:1, 21:1 and 19:1 for junior, senior and vertical schools respectively.  The Statistics Section of my Department's website contains extensive data in relation to our schools. The latest statistics available are for the 2023/24 school year. The 2023/24 educational statistical report shows that the average pupil teacher ratio at primary level last year was 12.8:1, while the average class size was 22.5. These ratios, brought about by recent budget improvements, are the lowest averages across the last 20 years. ",

        "answerText": " Minister for Social Protection  The range of leaves available to parents: Maternity, Paternity, and Parent’s Leaves are the responsibility of the Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth.  Any decision regarding the transfer of that leave to grandparent would be a matter for that Minister.  The Department of Social Protection has responsibility for the associated benefit payments.  Maternity, Paternity, and Parent’s Benefit are payments made to parents who are on the corresponding leave from work or who are self-employed and who satisfy certain PRSI contribution conditions.  Budget 2025 increased the rate of each benefit to €289 per week.  Maternity Benefit is payable for 26 weeks with two weeks minimum to be taken before the due date of birth of the child and the remainder from the date of birth.  Mothers can also avail of an additional 16 unpaid weeks commencing immediately after the end of their Maternity Leave.  Paternity Benefit is payable for two weeks within the first 26 weeks following the birth of the child.  Parent’s Benefit is payable to each parent for nine weeks and it can be taken in nine consecutive weeks or separately before the child’s second birthday.  This brings the paid leaves available to parents to 46 weeks.  If the mother avails of the additional 16 weeks of unpaid Maternity Leave, the leaves available cover 62 weeks.  These leaves aim to support parents at a crucial time for the development of their relationship with their child.  Additionally, each of these leaves must comply with the European Work Life Balance Directive which provides for a minimum of 14 weeks maternity benefit, 10 days of paternity leave, and two months of non-transferable parent’s leave for each parent.  The Directive aims to promote gender equality in the care of children and in the workplace and transferring four weeks of leave to grandparents would impact this commitment.  It would also impact Ireland’s compliance to the Work Life Balance Directive.  Simply transferring leave and benefit entitlement to grandparents would not incur obvious additional costs in relation to the payment benefits.  I trust this clarifies the matter for the Deputy. ",

In order to issue this new payment some changes to my Department’s systems are required.  As a result, the first new baby payment will issue in the new year in respect of those babies born in December.  Child Benefit has been awarded in respect of over 270,000 newborn babies over the last 5 years, an average of 54,000 per annum.  Based on this average, the net cost of increasing the Child Benefit lump sum payment to €1,000 in respect of all newborn babies would be approximately €39 million per annum.

The primary disability related social assistance scheme is Disability Allowance, which is a means-tested payment for people with a specified disability who are aged between 16 and 66.  In addition to the means test, in order to be eligible, the disability must be expected to last for at least one year.  The allowance is also subject to a medical assessment and a habitual residency requirement.  The current maximum personal rate of Disability Allowance is €232 per week.  If this figure was increased by €5 per week, based on recipient figures from the end of September 2024, (166,453) the additional cost would be almost €43.3 million per annum.  I am committed to improving outcomes for people with a disability.  As a result, I announced an extensive range of cost of living measures to support people with disabilities in Budget 2025 including a €12 increase in the maximum personal rate of weekly disability payments, including Disability Allowance, from January 2025.  There will be proportionate increases for people on a reduced rate.  Other improvements for people with disabilities include:  • October 2024 cost of living bonus for people in receipt of a long term weekly social welfare payment.  • €400 cost of living lump sum payment for people in receipt of Disability Allowance, Invalidity Pension and Blind Pension, paid in November 2024.  • €300 cost of living lump sum payment to all households getting Fuel Allowance, paid in November 2024.  • €200 cost of living lump sum payment to people who are getting a Living Alone Increase, paid in November 2024.  • €100 cost of living lump sum payment for people getting a Child Support Payment (previously known as Increase for a Qualified Child), paid for each qualified child in November 2024.  • Christmas bonus to all persons in receipt of a long-term disability payment to be paid in December 2024.  • Weekly rates of Child Support Payment (previously known as Increase for a Qualified Child) will increase by €8 to €62 for those aged 12 and over, and by €4 to €50 for under 12s in January 2025  I trust this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.

        "answerText": " Minister for Social Protection  The Free Travel scheme provides free travel on the main public and private transport services for those eligible under the scheme.  There are over one million customers with direct eligibility.  The estimated expenditure on free travel in 2024 is €103.5 million.  Providing an accurate projection of the cost of extending the free travel scheme to all children in receipt of Domiciliary Care Allowance is very difficult as the cost is determined by the usage of the extra passes provided and not by the number of newly qualified people.  Therefore, my Department is not able to provide an accurate estimate cost of the measure outlined by the Deputy.  Any decision to extend the Free Travel scheme to those in receipt of Domiciliary Care Allowance would require additional funding for the free travel scheme and would have to be considered in the context of overall budgetary negotiations.  Domiciliary Care Allowance is a monthly payment to the carer of a child with a disability.  The allowance may be used for the additional costs involved in caring for the child and this may include additional transport costs.  In Budget 2025, I announced that Domiciliary Care Allowance will increase by €20 to €360 a month from January 2025.  In addition, all recipients of Domiciliary Care Allowance qualify for the Carer's Support Grant in June of each year.  As part of Budget 2025 I further announced that the rate will increase by €150 to €2,000 per year for each carer.  Finally, the Department of Social Protection provides Additional Needs Payments as part of the Supplementary Welfare Allowance scheme for people who have an essential need, which they cannot meet from their own resources.  These payments are available through our Community Welfare Officers and include help towards recurring travel costs that cannot be met from the person's own resources and are deemed to be necessary.  I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy. ",

        "answerText": " Minister of State at the Department of Social Protection  The Department offers a range of employment schemes and other supports to encourage long-term unemployed people to return to work, while also assisting communities across the country in the provision of vital services.  They are targeted at people who have been on an unemployment payment or certain other social welfare payments for a specific period of time.  Community Employment (CE) and Tús are employment activation measures designed to provide eligible long-term unemployed people and other disadvantaged persons with an opportunity to engage in useful work within their communities on a temporary, fixed term basis.  The Rural Social Scheme (RSS) is an income support initiative that provides part-time employment opportunities in community and voluntary organisations for farmers or fishermen who are in receipt of certain social welfare payments and who are underemployed in their primary occupation.  There are currently 19,339 participants on CE, 4,503 participants on Tús and 2,693 participants on the RSS.  Government investment in the schemes will amount to over €500 million in 2024.  As part of the Budget 2025 measures, CE, Tús and RSS participants will receive an increase in their weekly payment arising from the increase in core social welfare payments of €12.00 per week with effect from 1st January 2025. Participants also receive the weekly top-up allowance of €27.50.  In effect, these changes ensure that the minimum payment for participants will increase from €259.50 per week to €271.50 per week from January 2025.  In addition, all participants have received the October 2024 Cost of Living double week payment and will also be eligible for the Christmas double payment in December 2024, and for those eligible the double payment of Child Benefit to be paid in both November and December 2024.  A number of once off Cost of Living bonus payments were also announced in Budget 2025, which will benefit eligible CE, Tús and RSS participants, including a once off payment of €300 for those in receipt of the Fuel Allowance, €200 for those in receipt of Living Alone Allowance and €100 for those in receipt of an Increase for a Child Support Payment (CSP) (previously known as Increase for a Qualified Child).  It is estimated that the annual additional cost of increasing the weekly top-up payment of €27.50 for CE, Tús and RSS participants by €5, based on the total number of places available on the schemes, would be approximately €8 million.

        "answerText": " Minister for Social Protection  The estimated full year cost to increase the Carer's Allowance payment for over 66's from its current weekly rate €286, to a weekly rate of €325 is €22.5m.  The estimated full year cost to increase the Carer's Allowance payment for under 66's from its current weekly rate €248, to a weekly rate of €325 is €262.5m.  The combined cost is €285m.  Estimating the abolition of a means test is difficult and any such estimate is by definition high level and as such should be treated with caution as the actual outcome may be quite different.  The Department estimates that removing the means test for carer's allowance in its entirety would give rise to additional costs of more than €600 million.  Taking account of estimates of inflows, this could potentially increase to between €880 million and €2 billion a year.  The costs shown above are on a full year basis and are based on the estimated number of recipients in 2025.  It should be noted that these costings are subject to change in the context of emerging trends and associated revision of the estimated numbers of recipients for 2025.

        "answerText": " Minister for Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth  My officials have prepared an estimated cost of funding for public early childhood education and school-aged care services under the following assumptions:  • Assuming each service delivers 60 places, 17 services will deliver 1,020 places  • ELC operating 45 hours/week, 52 weeks/year.  • SAC operating 45 hours/week, 14 weeks/year (out of term).  • SAC operating 20 hours/week, 38 weeks/year (in term).  • Each service has the following capacity profile:  • 0-1 year old: 3 places & 1-2 years old: 5 places (2 staff required – 1 Graduate Lead Educator, 1 EY Educator)  • 2-3 years old: 12 places (2 staff required – 1 EY Educator, 1 EY Lead Educator)  • 3-6 years old: 16 places (all of which are full time places, no ECCE-only children) – (2 staff required, 1 EY Educator, 1 Graduate Manager)  • SAC: 24 places (2 staff required – 1 SAC Coordinator, 1 SAC Practitioners)  • One Deputy Manager working for 35 hours per week to provide cover as necessary, allow for administration etc.  • These services will be staffed as per regulatory ratios, with provision for salaries at hourly rates stipulated by the most recent Employment Regulation Orders. These are the legally-required minimum hourly rates of pay for staff at different grades. Hourly rates in excess of these minimums would clearly increase services’ operating costs.  • Staff pay rates are:  • EY Lead Educator @ €14.70/hour  • EY Graduate Lead Educator @ €16.28/hour  • EY Educator @ €13.65/hour  • Deputy Manager @ €16.49/hour  • Graduate Manager @ €18.11/hour  • SAC Coordinator @ €14.70/hour  • SAC Practitioner @ €13.65/hour  • All rooms are fully staffed for the centre's opening duration.  • Assuming non-staff running costs, including premises costs are 32% of total costs and where 100% costs are determined by staffing costs (as per national averages in Independent Review of Costs of Independent Review of the Costs of Providing Quality Early Learning and Childcare in Ireland).

For 17 services offering 1,020 places, the annual operating cost is €8.6 million.  The cost to the Exchequer would depend on the fees paid by parents. If a parental fee was charged it would reduce the cost of funding a service. The impact would depend on the level of fee and the level of occupancy of the service.  These costings are for determining the operating costs of services based on current data and operations in the sector.

These are the legally-required minimum hourly rates of pay for staff at different grades. Hourly rates in excess of these minimums would clearly increase services’ operating costs.  • Each service has the following capacity profile:  • 0-1 year old: 6 places (1 room, 2 staff required – 1 Early Years Educator @ €13.65, 1 Lead Educator @ €14.70)  • 1-2 years old: 10 places (1 room, 2 staff required – 1 Early Years Educators @ €13.65, 1 Graduate Lead Educator @ €16.28)  • 2-3 years old: 12 places (2 staff required, 1 Early Years Educator @ €13.65, 1 Lead Educator @ €14.70)  • 3-6 years old: 32 places across 2 rooms (all of which are full time places, no ECCE-only children) – (4 staff required, 2 Early Years Educators @ €13.65, 1 Graduate Lead Educator @ €16.28, 1 (non-graduate) Manager @ €17.33)  • One Deputy Manager working for 35 hours per week @ €16.49 to provide cover as necessary, allow for administration etc.  • Assuming each service operates from 8:30am-5:30pm (45 hours/week) and all rooms are fully staffed for that duration.  • Assuming non-staff running costs, including premises costs are 32% of total costs and where 100% costs are determined by staffing costs (as per national averages in Independent Review of Costs of Independent Review of the Costs of Providing Quality Early Learning and Childcare in Ireland).

Deputy Colm Brophy asked the Minister for Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth the estimated cost of reducing early years and school aged care costs to a maximum of €400, €500 and €600, per family, per month; and if he will make a statement on the matter. [45854/24] ",
        "answerText": " Minister for Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth  This question requests the cost of reducing childcare fees so that families pay no more than €400 per month, €500 per month and €600 per month.  The NCS Universal Subsidy is available to all families with children under 15 years old. This subsidy is not means tested and provides €2.14 per hour towards the cost of a registered childcare place for a maximum of 45 hours per week.  This Department does not hold individualised fee data for parents as these are local agreements between parents and providers; instead a reduction in the average cost of ELC to parents is examined. To estimate these costs, data from Pobal on average weekly fees across the country was used. The NCS is not currently designed to apply subsidies at family level and it is necessary to make some assumptions to support such a model.  Estimated costs per monthly fee per family is presented below in tabular form. Each monthly fee cap per family is then explained in more detail below, describing the model used to calculate these costs and the assumptions and caveats applied in this modelling.     Monthly cost per family    Full year cost to Exchequer      €400    €121.65m      €500    €82.64m      €600    €58.71m     These estimates come with a number of caveats, from September 2024 a number of enhancements were made to the NCS, the estimates factor in these changes:  Increase in universal subsidy from €1.40 to €2.14.  Extension of NCS to families availing of childminders  Increase in NCS sponsor subsidy to €5.30 per hour for all children over the age of 1.  The impact of these changes is yet to be determined and carry a risk of altering the above costings due to increased participation of childminders for example. As such extensions to the scheme are based on estimates.  As has been referenced previously the above costing is based on an average fee, the Department is aware of significant variation in fees but without enough information must use an average. The distribution of costs for first/only children versus additional children is based on current Pobal data, if this distribution were to change through increased NCS participation or more children per family availing of the NCS this cost would increase significantly.  Finally, this costing is made on the basis of a static system; that is, the model assumes that the level of usage of eligible ELC does not increase or decrease but remains static. Any changes to subsidies may create a change in behaviour of families, for example, return to/increased labour force participation and use of formal ELC for the first time.   €400 per month fee cap per family   To ensure a cap of €400 per month for all families, data from Pobal on the number of children per family availing of the NCS was used. The first or only child in a family had their fees capped at €400 euro per month. This cap requires an increase to the universal subsidy for these children to €2.34 per hour. All children that are not the first child in the family had their universal subsidy set to the average weekly fee, which will theoretically cover their entire fee for full-time provision when averaged nationally.  As these costings are based on an average fee, the impact of this change would vary based on the level of fees within the services, patterns of usage and age of the child. The below estimates have been costed such that all families will have their costs reduced to at least €400 per month, in some cases the reduction will be greater.  The ESRI SWITCH model was then used to estimate the quantum of this change and applied to the Departments baseline cost of the NCS. The full year cost of this change was estimated at €121.65m.   €500 per month fee cap per family   To ensure a cap of €500 per month for all families, data from Pobal on the number of children per family availing of the NCS was used and the first or only child in a family had their fees capped at €500 euro per month.  Under the current NCS universal subsidy and based on the national average fee for full time childcare, families currently do not pay more than €500 per month for a single child. Because of this, the additional cost of this change is as a result of children that are not the first or only child claiming NCS in their family. These children had their universal subsidy set to the average weekly fee, which will theoretically cover their entire fee for full-time provision when averaged nationally. The universal subsidy for the first children in these multiple children families were adjusted down to reflect the €500 cap.  As these costings are based on an average fee, the impact of this change would vary based on the level of fees within the services, patterns of usage and age of the child. The below estimate has been costed such that all families will have their costs reduced to at least €500 per month, in some cases the reduction will be greater.  The ESRI SWITCH model was then used to estimate the quantum of this change and applied to the Departments baseline cost of the NCS. The full year cost of this change was estimated at €82.64m.   €600 per month fee cap per family   To ensure a cap of €600 per month for all families, data from Pobal on the number of children per family availing of the NCS was used and the first or only child in a family had their fees capped at €600 euro per month.  Under the current NCS universal subsidy and based on the national average fee for full time childcare, families currently do not pay more than €600 per month for a single child.

        "answerText": " Minister for Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth  The 2025 budget allocation for the Access and Inclusion Model (AIM) is €80.861m. This funding covers the cost of the seven levels of AIM, which encompass a range of both universal and targeted supports for pre-school settings. It funds a programme of capital grants for specialised equipment, appliances, assistive technology and/or minor alterations for pre-school settings to ensure children with a disability can participate in Early Learning and Childcare. It is also intended to facilitate either the recruitment of additional staff or to compensate services for a reduction in the adult-to-child ratio in the pre-school room, supporting the meaningful participation of all children within the pre-school room.It provides access to therapeutic services where they are critical to enable a child to be enrolled and to meaningfully participate in their pre-school setting and access to expert early year’s educational advice and support from a team of dedicated Early Years Specialists.It also provides for continued development of a qualified and confident workforce through the provision of ongoing training courses such as Hanen and SPEL and provision of funding for training under the Leadership for Inclusion (LINC) training programme and employment of Inclusion Co-Ordinator (INCO) position.AIM has recently expanded beyond time spent in the Early Childhood Care and Education (ECCE) programme. This allows children to access AIM support for an additional 3 hours a day during the ECCE term and 6 hours outside of the ECCE term. To note, this costing assumes that all services are in a position to uplift provision by an additional 10% and that all families currently availing of AIM support would be in a position to avail of this additional support.

        "answerText": " Minister for Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth  In September 2024, DCEDIY commenced the rollout of Equal Start, a major model of supports to ensure children experiencing disadvantage can access and meaningfully participate in early learning and childcare.  790 services have been targeted, and 728 services have completed the sign-up process thus far.  Equal Start is designed to be developed and rolled out in phases. Services with the highest level of need are targeted in the early phases.  €17,185,000 has been allocated to Equal Start in 2025 raising from commitments in Budget 24 (13.4m) and Budget 25 (€4m). Full year costings of all these measures will be €25m.  For the 24/25 programme year this includes additional staffing supports providing for a 15% increase in staffing hours for Tier 1 services, and 8% for Tier 2 services based on the minimum staffing required under regulation.  Provision has also been made for additional supports for Traveller and Roma families delivered through Better Start and Tusla, language and literacy measures including the rollout of Early Talk Boost.  Additional measures for 25/26 includes provision for the following new development measures:  • An additional Nutrition Programme in priority ECCE only services;  • The development of a Parent Community Coordinator post to enhance parental engagement in services;  • The update and rollout of Diversity Equality and Inclusion guidelines and training.  An additional €1.3m will be provided to support small equipment purchases through capital measures to support the rollout of the additional nutrition programme.  It is not possible at this stage to provide a costing for full rollout of all Equal Start measures. Many of these measures will require further design and consultation and the rollout duration from 2024-2028 reflects that need. ",

The greatest year on year increase in the annual budget allocation during this time was in 2023, when my Department secured a €1 billion budget allocation, 5 years ahead of the First 5 2028 target. This represented a 51% increase on the 2022 allocation, and which funded the introduction of the Core Funding model, the introduction of universal National Childcare Scheme (NCS) payments, and the discontinuation of the practice of deducing hours in pre-school and school against NCS hours.

        "answerText": " Minister for Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth  Core Funding is a grant to Early Learning and Care (ELC) and/or School Age Childcare (SAC) providers towards their operating costs. The majority of Core Funding is distributed based on a service's capacity - the opening hours, opening weeks and the age group of children for whom services are provided as well as number of places available.  The introduction of Core Funding in 2022 brought a significant increase in investment for the sector, with €259 million of funding paid directly to services in year 1 of the scheme, of which €210.8 million was entirely new funding.  One of the key objectives of Core Funding is to support the sector as a whole with the introduction of direct supply-side funding, in addition to the ECCE programme and the NCS, to create a more stable and sustainable financial environment.  This funding, which increased by 11% (to €287 million) in year 2, increased again by another 15% in year 3 (to €331 million). A 10% increase to the current programme year costs of €331.04 million would be €33.104m.  The current funding allocation facilitates the following changes from 2 September:  The Base Rates for all age groups are increasing with larger increases in funding for places offered to children under the age of three. All providers currently signed up to Core Funding will receive a higher payment going forward to support their day-to-day costs.  The flat rate for services registered on the Tusla Early Years Register as sessional-only is increasing from €4,075 to €5,000. This will strengthen supports to sessional-only services, who typically operate for shorter hours per week and fewer weeks per year.  The minimum Base Rate allocation is increasing from €8,150 to €14,000. This is the minimum amount of funding a centre-based service will receive through their Base Rate. This ensures a minimum guaranteed income for services. This increase supports for smaller services and services operating in rural areas, who may be prone to fluctuations in demand.  Core Funding makes a significant additional contribution to services’ income, allowing them to better absorb increased costs such as staffing and energy costs.  Core Funding is set to rise to a minimum of €350.64 million in programme year 4 (September 2025 – August 2026), before additional funding ring-fenced to support the outcomes of further Employment Regulation Order (EROs) agreed by an independent Joint Labour Committees (JLC) is included. The cost of increasing this allocation by 10% would be €35.064 m.  The current proposed additional funding to support the outcomes of the JLC process is worth €45 million in year 4. Increasing this additional element of the funding by 10% would cost €4.5 million. ",

        "answerText": " Minister for Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth  The Childminding Development Grants were introduced in 2004 as part of the Childminding Initiatives, administered through the City and County Childcare Committees. The grant is designed to help childminders with the cost of safety items, equipment, play resources or minor household alterations.  Until 2023, a grant of up to €1,000 was available to cover 90% of the expenditure over two years and was paid in arrears on presentation of an expenditure report and receipts. The national funding allocation was €250,000.  In 2023, through the work being undertaken under the National Action Plan for Childminding 2021 – 2028, changes were made to the grant process. The changes to the grant were to allow for a 100% grant, available on an annual basis, with 75% of the grant paid in advance of expenditure. In addition, for the 2024 grant cycle the Childminding Development Grant funding allocation was doubled to €500,000, to assist more childminders to prepare for the opening of regulations to childminders from September 2024. The maximum grant per childminder is €1,000 per year.  The cost of increasing the total financial allocation for the grant scheme by 10% would be €50,000. Alternatively, if the allocation for 2025 were kept at €500,000, an increase in the maximum value of each grant of 10% would reduce the number of applications that could be accommodated within the annual allocation from 500 grants to 454 per year.
