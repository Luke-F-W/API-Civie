The Programme will provide a more efficient and decarbonised transport service for the area to help facilitate population and economic growth over the coming decades.  The Cork Area Commuter Rail Programme will be delivered on a phased basis. Phase 1 of the Programme, ‘Enable future electrification of Cork Commuter Rail’, was included in Ireland’s National Recovery & Resilience Plan as submitted to the European Commission in 2021. Phase 1 works are ongoing and are scheduled to be completed by Quarter 3 2026 as required by the European Commission.  In May 2024, Iarnród Éireann (IÉ) awarded a contract to TYPSA and Roughan O’Donovan, appointing them as multi-disciplinary consultants for the design of Phase 2 of the Programme, which includes the potential electrification of the network and a new fleet maintenance depot to cater for a new electrified fleet. Subject to securing funding and achieving the relevant approvals, Phase 2 of the Programme will progress after Phase 1 works have been completed.

        "answerText": " Minister for Finance  It is a general principle of taxation that, as far as possible, income from all sources should be subject to taxation. This is a well-established and broadly accepted principle.  Section 19 of the Taxes Consolidation Act (TCA) 1997, sets out that tax under Schedule E shall be charged in respect of every public office or employment of profit. Section 112 of the TCA 1997 brings into charge all salaries, fees, wages, perquisites or profits of any kind arising from an office or employment. Therefore, the long-standing position is that all tips, gratuities and service charges arising from an office or employment are chargeable to income tax under Schedule E in accordance with Section 112.  Gratuities from customers, for example service charges in hotels or tips in restaurants, paid to the employer and subsequently paid out to an employee should be included in pay for the income tax week or month in which they are paid out. These tips constitute pay for the purposes of the PAYE system. However, in a situation where an employee receives tips directly from customers, the employer is not obliged to operate PAYE and in that case, the tips and gratuities are fully taxable and should be included by the employee in his or her income tax return.  As you may be aware, the Payment of Wages (Amendment) (Tips and Gratuities) Act 2022 was enacted on 20 July 2022 and came into effect on 1 December 2022. The Act, which is under the remit of the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, introduced new rules about how employers must share tips, gratuities, and service charges amongst employees. It also prohibits the practise of using tips or gratuities to top up wages/contractual rates of pay.  In addition, the legislation provides transparency to customers, as it requires businesses to clearly display their policy on how tips, gratuities and service charges are distributed.

        "answerText": " Minister of State at the Department of Health  I convened a meeting between officials from the Dept of Health and Dept of Housing and the promoters of the Cork Integrated Inclusion Health Hub (IIHH) in October 2024. I welcomed the excellent collaboration between the Cork City Council and the HSE to develop this comprehensive proposal to address the health and social needs of people who are homeless in Cork city.  The IIHH would provide a centralised space in a suitable location offering a wide range of services, including access to housing supports, assertive outreach, welfare and medical care. It will also help to mitigate premature deaths among people who are homeless, with 20 such deaths recorded in the Cork region in 2020. HSE Southwest and CCC have together identified a property in the city centre which is available for a long-term lease and possible purchase. It is proposed that existing HSE services and a newly funded addiction care service will be relocated to this property, while Cork City Council commits to establish a day care service operating 7 days a week.  The proposal is aligned with the pathway to eradicate homelessness set out in Housing for All, specifically action 3.13 – strengthen integrated care pathways for people who are homeless with chronic health needs based on an inclusion health model, to achieve better health outcomes and to reduce premature death.  The HSE National Service Plan 2025 sets out a number of actions to meet the health needs to people who are homeless, including to maintain essential public health measures, consolidate advancements in healthcare delivery for people experiencing homelessness, provide health supports for 256 new Housing First tenancies and improve and expand access to healthcare services for people experiencing homelessness.  Officials in the Dept of Health are reviewing the capital costs of this proposal in the context of the HSE Capital Plan 2025, which is expected to be published shortly.  I am very supportive of the proposal and look forward to seeing it progress under the HSE service and capital plans and with the support of the Dept of Housing. ",

        "answerText": " Tánaiste and Minister for Social Protection  The State pension contributory is a very valuable benefit and is the bedrock of the Irish pension system. Therefore, it is important to ensure that those qualifying have made a sustained contribution to the Social Insurance Fund over their working lives. To ensure that the individual can maximise their entitlement to a State pension, all contributions paid or credited over their working life from when they first enter insurable employment until pension age are taken into account when assessing their entitlement and the level of that entitlement. Since 1961, when contributory pensions were introduced, the average contributions test has been used in calculating pension entitlement. Once over 16 years of age, the date a person enters into insurable employment is the date used for averaging purposes.  The homemaker’s scheme makes qualification for State pension (contributory) easier for those who take time out of the workforce for caring duties. The scheme, which was introduced in and took effect from 1994, allows up to 20 years spent caring for children under 12 years of age (or caring for incapacitated people over that age) to be disregarded when a person’s social insurance record is being averaged for pension purposes, subject to the standard qualifying conditions for SPC also being satisfied.  The most recently published Actuarial Review of the Social Insurance Fund confirms that the Fund provides better value to female rather than male contributors. It further confirms that those with lower earnings and those with shorter contribution histories, mostly women, have and will continue to obtain the best value for money from the Fund due to the distributive nature of the Fund.  For those with insufficient contributions to meet the requirements for a State pension (contributory), the State pension system provides alternative methods of support. If their spouse has a contributory pension, they may qualify for an Increase for a Qualified Adult amounting up to 90% of a full rate pension, which by default is paid directly to them. Alternatively, they may qualify for a means-tested State Pension (non-contributory), amounting to 95% of the maximum contributory pension rate.  Work is underway to replace the ‘yearly average’ system with a ‘total contributions approach’. Under this approach, the number of contributions recorded over a working life will be more closely reflected in the rate of pension payment received. It is expected that the total contributions approach to pension qualification will replace the current average contributions test for State pension (contributory) for new pensioners from 2020, although that date is subject to change, as this is a very significant reform with considerable legal, administrative, and technical challenges to be overcome in its implementation. The position of women who were homemakers will be considered very carefully in developing this reform. "

With this in mind, I requested that an Inter-Departmental Group, led by this Department, be established with a brief to bring forward recommendations to address this issue.  The Group has concluded its work and its recommendations were fully accepted and funded by Government. I announced, as part of Budget 2016, the necessary funding to implement the new model with costs estimated to be €15m in 2016 and with full year cost estimated to be €33m from 2017 onwards. This Group has identified a practical, workable model for meeting the needs of children with a disability and the allocation of funding is clear evidence of the Government's commitment to supporting vulnerable children.  When established, the new model will focus on the developmental level of children with disabilities, their functional ability and their needs. It will not focus on diagnosis, recognising that many children may not have a formal diagnosis at the time of presenting to pre-school.  The model, when fully operational, will deliver seven levels of support to enable the full inclusion and meaningful participation of children with disabilities in the ECCE Programme. These supports, which move from universal to highly targeted supports based on the needs of the child, include: enhanced continuing professional development for early years practitioners; grants for equipment, appliances and minor alterations, increased capitation for children with very complex needs, as well as access to therapeutic intervention.  Two groups have been established to oversee and implement the new model; a Cross Sectoral Implementation Group will oversee and monitor implementation, while the second group, the Project Group, will implement the model for roll-out by September 2016. Further details in relation to this measure are expected to be available in June this year.  Until this new model is introduced, the ECCE programme continues to make special provision for children with a disability to access it. Measures include an exemption from the upper age limit for qualification where a child would benefit from starting primary school at a later age. The County Childcare Committees continue to provide information and support for parents, and on some occasions assist in accessing supports locally and providing training for early years providers.  There is no additional funding available to this Department to support the employment of special needs assistants in pre-school services. The HSE, on an ad hoc basis, does make some supports available and it is expected that these arrangements will continue until the new model has been established. "

My Department has since had a further meeting with the ILCU to address technical aspects of its proposal.  Conscious of the independence of the Central Bank in its regulatory role in respect of credit unions, bilateral engagement has taken place between my Department and the Department of Finance to consider the potential regulatory and legislative implications of credit union involvement in the social housing sector.  The Central Bank commenced a number of new regulations for credit unions on 1 January 2016. Prior to their commencement, following careful consideration, the Central Bank made a number of modifications including to Regulation 25(2) which makes reference to the fact that the Central Bank may prescribe, in accordance with section 43 of the Credit Union Act 1997, further classes of investments for credit unions which may include investments in projects of a public nature. The effect of these modifications is that regulation 25(2) now provides that investment in projects of a public nature can include, but are not limited to, investments in social housing projects.  I acknowledge the recent modifications made by the Central Bank and the willingness of credit unions to actively seek a role in financing the delivery of social housing. I look forward to the ILCU’s further engagement with the Central Bank on foot of the regulatory changes made and my Department will continue to engage constructively with the ILCU in relation to their proposal.

The OPW received a number of applications in 2011 and 2012 from the Council, under the Minor Works & Coastal Protection Scheme, to carry out flood relief works in Ballinhassig. These applications did not meet the criteria for the scheme. A further application was received from the Council in March 2013 to carry out a flood risk assessment and outline design of flood relief proposals. This application was not approved as the area was subject to study as part of the Lee Catchment Flood Risk Assessment & Management (CFRAM). The OPW's consultants for the South Western CFRAM study reviewed the Lee CFRAM outputs in 2013 and indicated that the hydrology for the Owenboy River needed to be updated.  It is the intention of the OPW to update the hydrology and undertake a Flood Relief Feasibility Study for Carrigaline. In that context it is expected that progress on this study, which will cover Ballinhassig, will commence during the first half of 2016.  Depending on the outcome of the Feasibility Study, flood relief measures for Ballinhassig will be progressed if viable. "

        "answerText": " Minister of State at the Department of Health  As the Deputy will be aware, the medical card scheme is a demand-led scheme and the number of cards at any given time reflects those persons who have met the eligibility criteria governing the scheme. It is challenging to project precisely the potential changes in numbers eligible as persons who currently do not hold a medical card could become eligible due a change in circumstances, either on a means or a discretionary basis. Furthermore, existing medical cards, save where granted following discretionary consideration, are subject to a periodic review of eligibility which can result in renewal, change or removal of eligibility as particular to the cardholders’ circumstances, such as positive changes in income.  The HSE National Service Plan for 2016 assumes that the number of medical cards will continue to decline such that the number of persons covered will fall by some 50,000 from the end of 2015 to the end of 2016. This reduction takes account of variables such as demographic and economic growth.  While the number of persons on the Live Register may have reduced, many people who took up employment may have continued to qualify for a medical card on basis of being below the income guidelines in the means test.  The Deputy may be aware that people who have been unemployed for a minimum of 12 months can retain their medical card for a period of three years (without a means test) if they commence employment. Persons who take up approved training/work schemes retain their medical card for the duration of the scheme. "

Information on social housing units constructed and acquired in respect of all local authorities and approved housing bodies and funded by direct capital investment by my Department, is published on my Department’s website at the following link:  http://www.environ.ie/en/Publications/StatisticsandRegularPublications/HousingStatistics/FileDownLoad,15291,en.xls .  Data up to Quarter 3 of 2015 is currently available, including a breakdown across the different categories of delivery for all local authorities. Data for the full 2015 calendar year will be available in the first months of 2016.  We now have a strong pipeline of new social housing construction projects in place following from my announcement in May 2015 of the first major social housing build programme under the Social Housing Strategy, with a further substantial announcement in July 2015 of approvals for local authorities and approved housing bodies. Between these two announcements, half a billion euro has been allocated for 2,900 social housing new builds and acquisitions to end 2017. Details of these approvals are available on my Department’s website at the following links:    http://www.environ.ie/en/DevelopmentHousing/Housing/News/MainBody,41340,en.htm    http://www.environ.ie/en/DevelopmentHousing/Housing/News/MainBody,42225,en.htm .  In addition, under the Social Housing Current Expenditure Programme approved housing bodies can purchase, lease or construct housing units and make them available for social housing. While the main activity under this programme to date has been through purchase and leasing already completed units, by the end of November 2015, the construction of 17 new units had been completed and made operational for social housing purposes in 2015, with a further 589 new construction units approved but not yet completed.  It is not possible to confirm at this stage the exact breakdown of local authority units to be commenced or completed in 2016 on a county by county basis. All projects must proceed through the planning process and this and other factors can have a direct impact on the timing for the advancement of construction projects. "

The latest results were published on August 26 2015 and estimated that in mid-April 2015 there were approximately 142,900 persons aged 80 years and over usually resident in the State.  The Central Statistics Office also publishes population projections for the State after each Census, the most recent set of projections were published in April 2013 and cover the years 2016-2046. The projections are based on assumptions relating to future trends in fertility, mortality and migration. Two sets of assumptions were chosen for fertility, one for mortality and three for migration.  The base year used was 2011, using the Census of Population results.  For the purpose of the tables provided, only the assumptions relating to mortality and migration are relevant. The fertility assumptions are not relevant as all persons that will be aged 80 years or over in the years 2016-2021 were already born in 2011.   Mortality Assumption   The long-term rate of improvement in life expectancy is assumed to be 1.5 per cent over the period 2016-2046.   Migration Assumptions   M1 : Net migration returning to positive (net inflow of persons) by 2016 and rising steadily thereafter to plus 30,000 persons annually by 2021.  M2 : Net migration returning to positive by 2018 and rising thereafter to plus 10,000 persons annually by 2021.  M3 : Net migration remaining negative for the whole period.  Table 1 shows the estimated population for those aged 80 years and over for 2015.  Table 2 shows the projected population for those aged 80 years and over for the years 2016-2021.  Table 3 shows the projected population change for 2015-2021.

        "answerText": " Minister for Education and Skills  I wish to advise the Deputy that the National Council for Special Education (NCSE) is responsible, through its network of local Special Educational Needs Organisers (SENOs), for allocating resource teachers and Special Needs Assistants (SNAs) to schools to support children with special educational needs.  The NCSE operates within my Department's criteria in allocating such support. The criteria by which SNA support is allocated to pupils is set out in my Department's Circular 0030/2014.  Once allocated, the deployment of SNAs within schools is then a matter for the individual Principal/Board of Management. SNAs should be deployed by the school in a manner which best meets the care support requirements of the children enrolled in the school for whom SNA support has been allocated. It is a matter for schools to allocate support as required, and on the basis of individual need, which allows schools flexibility in how the SNA support is utilised.  All schools were asked to apply for SNA support for the 2015/16 school year by 18th March 2015. The NCSE also continued to accept applications after this date in recognition that enrolments may not have been completed or where assessments were not completed.  The NCSE has published details of SNA allocations for schools for September 2015 on its website www.ncse.ie. Details of SNA allocations for 2014/15 are also available on the NCSE website.  The website indicates that the school in question had an allocation of 24 whole time equivalent (WTE) SNA posts in the 2014/15 school year, increasing to 28 WTE posts for the 2015/16 school year.  I understand that the NCSE has recently visited the school on foot of correspondence received from the school in relation to its SNA allocation. I have been advised that the NCSE will be in further contact with the school in this regard shortly.  All schools have the contact details of their local SENO, while Parents may also contact their local SENO directly to discuss their child's special educational needs, using the contact details available on www.ncse.ie.

[40506/15] ",
        "answerText": " Minister for Children and Youth Affairs  In Budget 2016, I announced an €85 million package of additional investment for childcare. This includes funding for:  - An extension to the Early Childhood Care and Education (ECCE) programme so that children can enrol in the programme at age three and continue in the programme until they make the transition to primary school. This will reduce childcare costs by an additional €1,500 and will increase the current 38 weeks of free pre-school provision by an average of 23 weeks, and up to 61 weeks depending on the child's date of birth and the age at which they subsequently start primary school. The extension to this programme, which will be introduced from September 2016, will cost an additional €47 million in 2016. The full year additional costs of this extended programme will be in the region of €112 million.  - A suite of supports to help children with a disability to participate fully in the ECCE programme. This delivers on my commitment to address these children’s particular needs in mainstream pre-school settings. Funding of €15 million has been provided to phase supports in during 2016, with a full year cost of €33 million from 2017 onwards.  - 8,000 extra places in 2016 under the CCS programme to help low income and disadvantaged families access quality childcare. These 8,000 places, which are in addition to a further 5,000 CCS places I announced recently with savings achieved in 2015, will cost in the region of €16 million.  - A range of measures to improve the quality of early years and school-aged childcare, including an audit of quality; an extended Learner Fund to support professionalisation of the sector; and an enhanced inspection regime. Funding of €3.5 million is provided for these quality measures in 2016 and will be built upon over coming years.  Budget 2016 also resources a dedicated Project Team to develop a single Affordable Childcare programme to provide working families with good quality childcare at a cost they can afford. Work on this programme will begin immediately, so that it can be in place by 2017. This programme will replace existing targeted programme - Community Childcare Subvention (CCS), along with the Training and Employment Childcare (TEC) programmes, comprising After-School Childcare (ASCC), Childcare Education and Training Support (CETS), and Community Employment Childcare (CEC), providing a new simplified subsidy programme, through both community/not-for-profit and private childcare providers.  €3 million is also being provided to support both community/not-for-profit and private childcare providers who need minor funding to develop after-school services using existing school and other accessible community facilities.
