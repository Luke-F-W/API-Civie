        "answerText": " Minister for Transport  The Government is fully committed to supporting a significant expansion and modernisation of the EV charging network over the coming years. Having an effective and reliable charging network is an essential part of enabling drivers to make the switch to electric vehicles.  Home charging is the primary charging method for most Irish EV owners as it’s convenient and cheaper for the consumer as well as assisting in the overall management of the national grid. Over 80% of charging is expected to happen at home.  In July 2025, the Department of Climate, Energy and the Environment adopted a Strategy Statement on Private Wires. This is a significant reform of the rules on electricity infrastructure. It will unlock private sector investment in electricity infrastructure, particularly renewable generation and storage and will potentially enable the use of EV chargers to support on-street parking in specific circumstances.  Zero Emission Vehicles Ireland (ZEVI) is a dedicated Office within the Department of Transport, charged with supporting consumers, the public sector and businesses to continue to make the switch to zero emission vehicles and fully supports the Department of Climate, Energy and Environment strategy on private wires. There is also a need for a seamless public charging network that will provide for situations or instances where home charging is not possible.  The Regional and Local EV Charging Network Plan provides a pathway for the accelerated delivery of public destination and neighbourhood charging and will be led by Local Authorities and funded by ZEVI, to develop local and regional EV charging network strategies and implementation plans. This process will identify the number of charge points required in each area, including on-street chargers to serve residents without access to private off-street parking. While strategies are being finalised, ZEVI is funding pilot infrastructure projects in a number of Local Authorities, so as not to delay any initial rollout.  Some authorities have already completed their strategies, while others are in progress. It is anticipated that most of these plans will be finalised in the coming months. ",

        "answerText": " Minister for Transport  The National Transport Authority (NTA) is the independent transport regulator of the small public service vehicle (SPSV) sector, and I am not involved in the day-to-day operations of that sector.  Section 24 of the Consolidated Taxi Regulation Acts 2013 & 2016 empowers the NTA Board to make a “Maximum Fares Order” fixing the maximum fare that may be charged by the driver of a taxi for any journey. The current maximum fares order took effect in December 2024, and a maximum fare review is carried out approximately every 2 years. The NTA has conducted these reviews since 2011. Hackneys and limousines agree their fares in advance and do not use a meter.  The Taxi Regulation (Maximum Fares) Order 2024 increased taxi fares by an average of 9% and ensures that taxi fares continue to reflect the rising costs associated with operating a taxi in Ireland. This increase includes a special rate for the weekend peak, year-round, to incentivise more drivers to service the night-time economy. The 2024 Order built on the 2022 Maximum Fares Order in which a 12% increase on fares was introduced.  As set out in the legislation, charging more than this maximum fare can lead to a prosecution, however, charging below the maximum fare is permitted. I understand that the Uber Fixed Price offer does not breach the maximum fare regulatory provisions for taxis or constitute an offence associated with the misuse of taximeters.  I issued a letter to the NTA on 19 November asking that they clarify the regulatory position on the Uber fixed price fare for the information of taxi operators and public representatives alike. I also met with the Advisory Committee on SPSVs on 27th November, whose role it is to provide advice to the Minister and the NTA in relation to issues relevant to SPSVs and their drivers, where the Uber fixed price fare was discussed. I intend to further engage with SPSV sectoral representatives on this issue, once I receive the regulatory clarification from the NTA. ",

        "answerText": " Minister for Transport  As Minister for Transport, I have responsibility for policy and overall funding in relation to public transport. The National Transport Authority (NTA) has responsibility for the planning and development of public transport infrastructure, including the provision of BusConnects.  BusConnects is providing a transformative programme of investments in the bus services across five cities in Ireland. In each city the programme will involve a mix of network redesign, new electric bus fleet, and the provision of segregated bus and cycling facilities to support more efficient journey times for sustainable transport modes.  As the Deputy may be aware, my Department recently published its NDP Sectoral Plan, setting out indicative timelines for major transport projects, including the five BusConnects programmes. Indicative timelines indicate some BusConnects construction components will extend beyond 2030.  Steady progress has been made in developing and implementing BusConnects in recent years.  In relation to BusConnects Dublin, which is the most advanced of the programmes, there have been some positive developments recently, with An Coimisiún Pleanála having approved all 12 of the BusConnects Dublin Core Bus Corridor Schemes. The first of these Schemes, the Liffey Valley to City Centre Core Bus Corridor, is due to enter construction this month, while the contract for the second, the Ballymun-Finglas Core Bus Corridor, was signed this week and will enter construction in 2026.  The first seven phases of new bus service routes as part of the bus network in Dublin have been implemented. The NTA rolled out Phase 7, the F-Spine (Finglas to Tallaght) in October 2025.  There are currently circa 120 double-deck electric buses in service in Dublin and 60 in Limerick. Further electric buses will roll-out over the coming years.  BusConnects Cork received Government approval at Approval Gate 1 of the Infrastructure Guidelines in October 2025. This will enable the major infrastructure element, the Sustainable Transport Corridors, to enter the planning system in 2026.  BusConnects Waterford, Galway and Limerick are in their earlier stages compared to BusConnects Cork and Dublin.  Noting the NTA's responsibility in the matter, I have referred the Deputy's question to the NTA for a more detailed reply. Please contact my private office if you do not receive a reply within 10 days. ",

        "answerText": " Minister for Education and Youth  The project was approved to enter the department’s pipeline of school buildings to provide a four Classroom Special Educational Needs (SEN) base, a general-purpose room and Ancillary under the department ‘s Additional School Accommodation (ASA) Scheme. The project is a joint project between the Boys & Girls National schools.  Approval to proceed to Stage 2b (developed design) was granted in March 2024, and planning permission was confirmed by the design team in July 2025. The Department now awaits the post-planning Stage 2b report, which will be reviewed from both technical and cost perspectives in line with the Public Spending Code. All projects, including this one, will undergo the necessary due diligence outlined in the Public Infrastructure Guidelines. Managing timing, scope, and cost is crucial to staying within budgetary limits for the overall program  In February 2025, the school was advised to apply to the Emergency Works Scheme for any health and safety concerns, as refurbishment of the existing building is outside the scope of the ASA project.  The Department has consulted with the design team regarding the heating infrastructure and is currently awaiting the cost estimate, which is expected to form part of the Stage 2B report.  Since 2020, my department has invested over €6 billion in our schools throughout the country under the National Development Plan, involving the completion of over 1,300 school building projects. Government support for this investment, including by way of supplementary capital funding, has delivered real benefits for school communities. Supplementary capital funding of €210 million approved by Government has brought the total capital allocation for 2025 for my department to €1.6 billion.  In July the Government announced a capital allocation of €7.55 billion for the Department of Education and Youth for the period 2026-2030 under the National Development Plan. As part of this NDP allocation my department will place a strong emphasis on provision for children with special educational needs, with a particular focus on meeting annual school place needs. In relation to project rollout for Large-Scale projects and Additional School Accommodation scheme projects, the approach will be to continue to maximise the capacity of the existing school estate as much as possible in the first instance and provide necessary additional capacity through targeted and prioritised project rollout over the course of 2026 to 2030 period to meet the most urgent and prioritised needs.  My department is now preparing an NDP implementation plan which is due for publication later in the year. This plan will optimise outputs from the NDP allocations, with a strong focus on maximising existing school capacity, progressing priority projects where local capacity across schools in the area is insufficient, and ensuring delivery that is affordable, offers value for money, and meets functional needs.

As of November 2025, there are over 1,550 employers availing of the Wage Subsidy Scheme and 2,615 employees supported through the scheme.  In 2024, the highest paid employer received €1.4 million under the scheme and the lowest paid employer received €151.20. The mean amount received by all companies in 2024 was €14,698.20. A breakdown by sector or local authority area is not available.

It would not be appropriate for me to provide details of specific payments to individual companies as that information could be commercially sensitive.

In March 2025, as Minister, I signed the Orders to commence the Gambling Regulation Act 2024 and establish the Gambling Regulatory Authority of Ireland (GRAI). At its heart, the Gambling Regulation Act 2024 is a public health measure aimed at protecting our citizens from gambling harm, including younger people and those more vulnerable in our communities. The Act provides for a number of safeguards to protect people from those harms.  As provided for in the Act, the GRAI will introduce and oversee tight restrictions on the advertisement of gambling activities. The Authority will have wide-ranging power to prescribe the times, place and events where gambling advertising can be broadcast, displayed or published, and to specify the frequency with which advertising can be broadcast, the duration of advertisements, and the number of advertisements that can be shown.  This power will allow the Authority to address the issue of gambling advertising on social media, online and on traditional media such as on television, radio, websites, apps, in print, and outdoor advertising such as billboards, etc.  The Authority will begin its licensing and enforcement functions on a phased basis from early next year.

        "answerText": " Minister for Culture, Communications and Sport  At the outset, it is important to say that significant progress has been made in improving online safety in Ireland. Since the establishment of Coimisiún na Meán in March 2023, we have seen the emergence of Ireland’s online safety framework, with An Coimisiún at its heart. An Coimisiún is Ireland’s Digital Services Coordinator under the Digital Services Act and a competent authority under the EU Terrorist Content Online Regulation. And in October 2024, under the Online Safety and Media Regulation Act, An Coimisiún adopted Ireland’s first online safety code, which has applied in full since July of this year.  A failure to adequately fulfil obligations under the aforementioned legislation can lead to significant financial sanctions and continued non-compliance can lead to criminal sanctions for senior management under the Online Safety and Media Regulation Act.  Nothwithstanding this progress, I continue to work across Government and with all stakeholders to ensure children and young people can be safe from harmful or illegal content online. In particular, I want to progress robust age verification. It is a vital part of the picture in terms of providing real assurance that children are the age they claim to be and to ensure they are not exposed to harmful or illegal content. I am seeking the inclusion of a commitment to this effect in the Government’s updated National Digital Strategy which will be published later this year.  In addressing age verification, we must seek to ensure that there are trustworthy systems in place that are interoperable and respect users’ rights, including data protection rights. To that end, my officials are continuing to work with the Government’s Chief Information Officer and his Office to look at practical technical solutions to age verification as part of the Government's Digital Wallet being developed using MyGovID.  In addition, right across Europe, Member States are examining the question of prohibiting access by children and young people to social media platforms – the so-called “digital age of majority”. Ireland is also considering its position on this matter but I believe that any decision would be better taken at EU level.  In this context, the EU Audio Visual Media Services Directive, which is the basis for Ireland's Online Safety Code, will be evaluated over the coming year and further measures are likely to be proposed at European level in the latter half of next year. Ireland will work with all stakeholders to ensure that additional legislative proposals are robust in addressing harms posed to children online. I also plan to make online safety a key theme of Ireland's Presidency of the European Union in 2026.  I will continue to work with all stakeholders, nationally and internationally, to ensure robust safety measures, including robust age verification, are in place to protect children and young people from inappropriate, harmful and illegal online content.

This will have a meaningful impact on the housing market, increased supply will help dampen house price growth and ease affordability challenges across the country, and ensure that everyone has a range of housing options available to them, whether they want to buy a house, rent one, or are in need social housing. Measures such as the Local Authority Home Loan, the Local Authority Purchase and Renovation Scheme, the Help to Buy Incentive, First Home Scheme and the Vacant Property Refurbishment Grant are also available to help make home ownership more affordable.  In this context, household buyers and particularly first-time buyer activity remains robust, with recent data showing the number of new homes purchased by first-time buyers increased 25% year-on-year in the 12-months to end September 2025. While Mortgage drawdowns increased 10% year-on-year in the 12-months ending Q3 2025 (c.45,700). More than 27,300 of these were drawn down by FTBs, an increase of 7% year-on-year. FTBs continued to be the most active segment in the market, accounting for 59.7% of drawdowns in the 12 months ending Q3 2025, these were the highest annualised FTB drawdowns since the 12 months ending Q4 2007.

The Programme for Government contains a commitment to introduce the Automatic Enrolment (AE) Retirement Savings System. The aim of introducing AE is to address the pension coverage gap that exists in Ireland and to provide workers with greater comfort and security regarding their retirement income. The new system - to be known as My Future Fund - will commence from 1 January 2026. The implementation of My Future Fund will pave the way for around 750,000 workers to be brought into a retirement savings scheme for the first time and I look forward to its implementation.  My Department has conducted two procurement processes for the provision of services related to the implementation of My Future Fund. The first procurement process was for a managed service provider to develop and operate the administration of My Future Fund. This procurement was conducted though a Competitive Procedure with Negotiation process. This involved a two stage process consisting of: Stage 1: Pre-Qualification Questionnaire (PQQ); and Stage 2: Request for Tender. The following five companies responded to the PQQ: Accenture Limited, FNZ, PlaNet21, SS&C Technologies, and Tata Consultancy Services. The two companies that progressed to Stage 2 were Accenture Limited and Tata Consultancy Services. The contract for these services was ultimately awarded to Tata Consultancy Services.  The second procurement process was for investment management services. On foot of a request for tender the following companies submitted bids: Amundi; BlackRock; DWS; Irish Life Investment Managers; Legal & General Investment Management; Mercer; Northern Trust, and State Street Global Advisors. Following a rigorous evaluation process the following companies were selected as the preferred bidders for this service: Amundi, Blackrock and Irish Life Investment Managers.  As with any Government initiative, in designing the AE system and the management of My Future Fund, my Department worked across a range of Government departments and agencies, through the Cabinet Committee structure and through bilateral engagements. These included the Department of Finance in relation to taxation matters, the Department of Public Expenditure, Infrastructure, Public Service Reform and Digitalisation in relation to the staffing and financing of the National Automatic Enrolment Retirement Savings Authority (NAERSA), the Revenue Commissioners in relation to the payroll data requirements and the Pensions Authority in respect of pension systems more generally.  I hope this clarifies matters for the Deputy. ",

The implementation of My Future Fund will pave the way for around 750,000 workers to be brought into a retirement savings scheme for the first time and I look forward to its implementation.  My Department has conducted two procurement processes for the provision of services related to the implementation of My Future Fund. The first procurement process was for a managed service provider to develop and operate the administration of My Future Fund. This procurement was conducted though a Competitive Procedure with Negotiation process. This involved a two stage process consisting of: Stage 1: Pre-Qualification Questionnaire (PQQ); and Stage 2: Request for Tender. The following five companies responded to the PQQ: Accenture Limited, FNZ, PlaNet21, SS&C Technologies, and Tata Consultancy Services. The two companies that progressed to Stage 2 were Accenture Limited and Tata Consultancy Services. The contract for these services was ultimately awarded to Tata Consultancy Services.  The second procurement process was for investment management services. On foot of a request for tender the following companies submitted bids: Amundi; BlackRock; DWS; Irish Life Investment Managers; Legal & General Investment Management; Mercer; Northern Trust, and State Street Global Advisors. Following a rigorous evaluation process the following companies were selected as the preferred bidders for this service: Amundi, Blackrock and Irish Life Investment Managers.

My Department provides funds to the Vincentian MESL Research Centre, to support the MESL research workplan.  One of the benefits of the work of the Vincentian MESL Research Centre is that it provides an analysis of the different levels of income needed for a wide range of household types, including the different costs that arise for households in rural and urban locations.  A comparison of household income compared to the MESL expenditure for different household types calculated by the Vincentian MESL Research Centre can be found in the appendix tables of each annual MESL update.  The primary Social Protection Budget measures that help to raise household income are increases to Primary Scheme rates and increases to the Child Support Payment (CSP). The table below outlines the increases to both the Primary Scheme rates and the CSP in the last five Budgets.

        "answerText": " Deputy Eoin Hayes  My question is about administration fees and charges being imposed as part of auto-enrolment. My understanding is that these fees have not been agreed or released publicly. I have some reservations more widely about whether it is still the case today that the Department and Government are sufficiently prepared when this scheme goes live, which is just a few short weeks away, as the Minister said yesterday. \n Deputy Dara Calleary  I thank the Deputy. I take this opportunity to wish him well. I look forward to working with him. This is his first time attending parliamentary questions as his party's spokesperson for social protection.  We will introduce automatic enrolment, My Future Fund, from 1 January 2026.  The aim is to address the pension coverage gap that exists in our country and to provide workers with greater comfort and security regarding their retirement income.  There will be two separate fee elements.  First, there will be an administration fee, which will cover the collection of contributions, the allocation to the investment plans and the provision of account management services.  Second, there will be a separate fee for investment management services. The administration fees associated with automatic enrolment are under active consideration as we speak and will be finalised following consultation with the new chief executive of the National Auto-Enrolment Retirement Savings Authority, NAERSA, and the Minister for Public Expenditure, Infrastructure, Public Services Reform and Digitalisation. I have written to the Minister this week in relation to this issue.  As previously announced, the administration fee will take the form of a flat weekly fee rather than a commission based on a percentage of funds under management.  In this way, the administration fee will reflect the actual costs of administration, which do not vary with fund size. They will be the same for all participants regardless of their income or the size of their retirement fund and will, ultimately, provide much better value for money for the participant over the course of a standard retirement planning horizon.  In addition to administration fees, there will be some fees for investment management services.  These services have been procured through a competitive procurement process conducted under EU rules. That tendering process required fees to be less than 0.1% of assets under management.  In this regard, I can confirm that the prices attached to the bids were significantly below the maximum ceiling and represent very good value for participants.  I am committed to ensuring that the fees in My Future Fund are kept low and that they are transparent, accessible and understandable, especially as the prospective participants in the system will be lower- and medium-income earners. \n Deputy Eoin Hayes  I thank the Minister. I very much hope the fees will be under 0.1% of assets under management. It would be extremely concerning if they were anywhere near that. My understanding from the Minister’s answer is that the fees have not been detailed, and this goes to the heart of the question of whether the State is adequately prepared to introduce auto-enrolment on 1 January as the Minister said today he would be doing.  As it stands, about €100 billion of pensions are in private occupational pension schemes. The Minister is planning on the State mandating a significant increase to that without there being any clarity on the fees for those affected. Importantly, in the UK, about 75% of the accounts of the national employment savings trust, NEST, scheme are dormant. If these fees are charged on the dormant accounts, it will compound the reduction of the contributions the individuals have made. It would be very concerning if this were to be the case here as well. If the My Future Fund mirrors what is happening with the NEST fund, it would create a huge problem for individuals. The fund in the UK currently has a deficit of £1 billion and we have lower economies of scale here. Does the Minister have any comparison with the UK experience and does he understand whether the fees will be applied to the dormant accounts? \n Deputy Dara Calleary  Ireland is the last country in the OECD to introduce auto-enrolment. This is not a good thing. The only good thing about it is we can learn from other products and countries and look at what we need to change here to make sure we do not end up with their problems. We have looked closely at NEST, given its proximity to us. We will observe it and ensure, through NAERSA, which will be independent of the Department and the Minister of the day, that it keeps us relevant. Most importantly, it is necessary to ensure it is as efficient and as accessible as possible.  It is not the State's money but each individual’s money. It is money belonging to each of the 750,000 people who are a part of this scheme. They will have access to information through the My Future Fund app online to see where their money is going and its investment. They will also have the choice to make whatever investment suits their stage in life, be that high-risk, medium-risk for low-risk investment. Through all that, we will ensure the fees associated with this are understood and transparent. Many people do not have that accessibility or availability in existing pension arrangements. \n Deputy Eoin Hayes  That goes to the heart of the question here, which is around the digital literacy of the individuals we are putting into this scheme. I am very concerned there is no plan for what we are going to guide people with in terms of the lump sum they will get at the end of the scheme. For those people in their 50s or 60s approaching retirement age who will get that lump sum, there seems to be no pathway to how they would account for the pension provision or ensure they are not taking risky decisions or making inappropriate use of those funds.  There is also a question around the overall structure of the fund and I want to keep an eye on that over the course of its implementation. I completely accept the NTMA could not handle 750,000 individuated pension scheme accounts. There is a question, however, around the pooling of risk. How will it be possible to ensure those 750,000 individuated accounts would be treated as a larger pension scheme guided by the State so it will be possible to ensure there will be lower volatility for investment returns for those individuals and the pension provision is secure for the future? \n Deputy Dara Calleary  That is exactly why we have established the structure of NAERSA, which is independent of the Department, with a very successful and experienced team of staff that we are building up now. It has an independent board that represents the interests of workers, employers and the public. Those kinds of operational decisions will be made by NAERSA. In relation to people exiting the scheme, it will be some years before that happens. NAERSA will take full operational control of the scheme and be able to provide that level of information. My focus now is getting it up and running. It is about trying to get an understanding that this is happening and this is why we have information resources available on gov.ie/autoenrolment .  I share the Deputy’s concerns and I will be discussing these NAERSA, including around digital literacy and ensuring that people who do have digital challenges and do not have that access to digital will be able access their information. This is something I try to do right across the Department. The establishment of an independent authority separate from the Government is in the best interests of those 750,000 people to make the best possible return for their future. I am confident it will make those decisions in the best interest of the citizens. ",

        "answerText": " Minister for Social Protection  I propose to take Questions Nos. 116 and 140 together.  My Department is making every effort to support affected workers at this time. On receiving the notification of proposed collective redundancy from the company concerned, my Department’s Employer Relations team made contact with the company to arrange to meet locally with affected employees to provide information on income, redundancy entitlements and employment supports. Meetings with the staff concerned are taking place this week.  Employees of the group have not been laid off but are in a 30-day consultation period from 31 October 2025. This means that they remain in employment during this period and continue to accrue an entitlement to wages. In order to protect their entitlements direct employees should not apply for a Jobseeker’s payment at this point as they are still considered employees of the company.  Employees in need of urgent financial assistance should visit their local Intreo Centre or Social Welfare Branch Office, where an application for Supplementary Welfare Allowance will be processed as a matter of urgency.  Following the completion of the consultation process, and if their employment ends, affected employees can apply for Jobseeker’s Pay-Related Benefit if they have sufficient PRSI contributions, or for the means-tested Jobseeker’s Allowance.  Self-employed franchise holders or contractors may qualify for Jobseeker’s Benefit (Self-Employed).  Direct employees of a franchise holder or self-employed contractor impacted by the receivership who are now on temporary layoff may apply for Jobseeker's Pay-Related Benefit or Jobseeker’s Allowance, depending on PRSI record and means. Supplementary Welfare Allowance is available pending decisions on their primary payment.  Employed workers may be entitled to redundancy benefits if they are laid off. If these cannot be covered by their employer, the Department of Social Protection’s Redundancy and Insolvency scheme is available. Where an employer or insolvency practitioner is unable to pay wages owed to employees due to insolvency, the receiver can apply for payment of arrears of wages from the Insolvency Payments Scheme following termination of employment.

        "answerText": " Minister for Social Protection  Following enactment Social Welfare (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2023 in December 2023, a 10 year transition away from Yearly Average (YA) to full implementation of Total Contributions Approach (TCA) began in January 2025.  During the transition period, a person will have their entitlement calculated using TCA and a separate transition rate made up of a proportion of the YA and TCA rates, with the person receiving the most beneficial rate of payment (i.e., transition rate or TCA-only rate).  In 2025, a transition rate made up of 90% of YA and 10% of TCA can be paid.  In 2026 it will be 80% YA and 20% TCA and so on each year until YA is removed fully in 2034.  To get a maximum pension payment under the TCA approach requires 2080 contributions, equivalent to 40 years.  The TCA approach includes provisions for up to 10 years of PRSI credits, and up to 20 years of HomeCaring periods with a cap of 20 years (1040) combined PRSI credits and homecaring periods.  TCA is a fairer and more transparent method for calculating the State Pension (Contributory) (SPC).  TCA resolves the anomalies arising from the YA calculation as the year a person commenced paying social insurance contributions will no longer be a key determining factor for pension entitlement rate calculation. Instead, the totality of social insurance contributions paid and credited will be simply added together.  This is an equitable approach as pension outcomes are more in line with the total number of contributions paid and credited.  The principle of higher contributory entitlements for those who contribute more frequently into the social insurance fund is central to contributory pensions around the world.  In 2023, the Department commissioned the ESRI to conduct an analysis on the impact of the move to TCA for SPC. The ESRI published its report on the 12th of June 2024.  The ESRI report showed that 87% of future claimants will see their rate of payment improve or stay the same.  While 13% would see their rate of payment decrease, those decreases would be relatively small and in line with their contributions to the Social Insurance Fund.  One third of women are expected to receive an increase in their rate.  More women will qualify for the maximum pension rate under the TCA (rising from 54% to 75%) due to the removal of anomalies associated with the YA.  I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy. ",

They are also engaging with officials from the Department of Social Protection as the Minister for Social Protection has responsibility for the payment of any associated benefits.  As the Deputy may be aware, the Minister for Health leads on the Health (Assisted Human Reproduction) Act 2024, which includes provisions in relation to surrogacy which have implications for the introduction of surrogacy leave.  Decisions on the date of commencement of the 2024 Act are matters for the Minister for Health.  I can assure the Deputy that this Department will work closely with relevant Departments once the 2024 Act has commenced to finalise proposals for surrogacy leave.  Under the Parent’s Leave and Benefit Act 2019 (as amended), working parents are entitled to nine weeks of paid Parent's Leave for each relevant parent, to be taken in the first two years after the birth or adoptive placement of a child.  Intending parents from a surrogacy agreement may be entitled to Parent's Leave, depending on their circumstances. The father of a child born through surrogacy can qualify for Parent's Leave if he is the biological father of the child and declared to be the parent of the child. In these circumstances, the father's partner may qualify for Parent's Leave if they are married to, or in a civil partnership with, the child’s biological father, or have cohabited with the child’s biological father for over 3 years.  The father of a child born through surrogacy can also qualify for Paternity Leave if he is the biological father of the child and declared to be the father of the child.  The leave entitlement is for two weeks, to be taken within six months of the child's birth.  Both the biological father and the other parent can qualify for 26 weeks each of unpaid Parental Leave if acting in loco parentis in respect of a child under 12. This can be extended until a child reaches the age of 16 if they have a disability or long term illness. ",

In 2022, the Department commissioned a Regulatory Impact Analysis (RIA) on the introduction of a levy on single use cups and a public consultation on draft regulations was undertaken. It was envisaged, at the time, that a levy might be introduced in a similar way to the plastic bag levy (i.e. at the point of sale in a retail premises).  Following further engagement with the Revenue Commissioners, an alternative collection model, collecting the levy when cups are first placed on the market by producers or importers, was discussed. Such a revision would require an amendment of the Circular Economy and Miscellaneous Provisions Act 2022. The Department continues to work with the Revenue Commissioners on this.  Furthermore, the Department has recently commissioned an update to the RIA which will explore the potential impacts of the revised collection model and any other policy measure which may reduce single use cup consumption effectively.

Furthermore, many tax expenditures have been phased out. Additionally, in 2021 Government established the Commission on Taxation and Welfare, which issued its report in 2022.  Government has continued to widen the tax base. For example, we have further increased the rate of carbon tax despite considerable opposition. This is a demonstration of our commitment to base broadening reforms.  At the same time, we are also transferring excess tax receipts into the Future Ireland Fund and Infrastructure, Climate and Nature Fund instead of using them to fund day-to-day spending.  Most importantly, we will continue to run budgetary surpluses over the medium term, so we are actively working to mitigate the risks associated with a narrow tax base from multiple directions. ",

        "answerText": " Minister for Finance  The Residential Development Stamp Duty Refund Scheme provides for a partial repayment of Stamp Duty paid on the acquisition of land where the land is subsequently developed for residential purposes.  The Scheme was introduced to encourage residential property development and, as such, contains strict conditions designed to satisfy this policy intent. These include the condition that construction operations must commence on the land within 30 months after it has been acquired, and the condition that the development must be completed within 30 months after it has been commenced. Where the development is carried out in phases, as is the case in relation to many multi-unit developments, each phase must be completed within 30 months after it has been commenced.  Where the conditions of the Scheme are met, the amount to be repaid is the difference between the Stamp Duty paid at the rate of 7.5 per cent on the acquisition of the land and the amount that would have been paid had the rate of 2 per cent applied.  The Scheme is being extended by five-years in Finance Bill 2025 so that it will now operate until the end of 2030. A number of amendments are also being made to it, some of which are primarily technical in nature, however two are designed to enhance the overall effectiveness of the Scheme.  One of these provides that a full repayment of Stamp Duty can be claimed once construction on a multi-phase development commences. Currently, repayments can be claimed either in respect of each phase after construction on it commences, or after the entire development has been completed. This change will improve cash-flow for developers and also cut down on red-tape for them.  I am also extending both of the time limits that apply, i.e. from acquisition to commencement, and from commencement to completion, for large-scale residential developments (also known as ‘LRDs’). Instead of the 30-month limits that normally apply, 36-month limits will apply in the case of LRDs. This change is intended to reflect the fact that such developments can take longer to get off the ground and to complete than small scale developments.  As with all tax reliefs and exemptions, my Department continues to monitor the effectiveness of this relief, engaging with Revenue, the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage, and other interested parties as necessary. In turn, and as exemplified by the proposed changes set out in Finance Bill 2025, my Department will then recommend actions to me intended to enhance that effectiveness where a need for them has been identified.  To conclude, I would also point out that the application of sunset clauses, such as the one that applies to the Scheme whereby it is currently due to close to new commencements on 31 December 2025 but is being extended to 31 December 2030 in Finance Bill 2025, ensures that tax reliefs and exemptions are reviewed in depth, and with a regularity commensurate with their uptake and the level of potential revenue foregone.

As one element of the Government's overall strategy to accelerate housing delivery, in Budget 2026 I introduced a new enhanced corporation tax deduction of 125% of certain qualifying costs, up to a maximum additional deduction of €50,000 per apartment. This has the potential to providing a net cost reduction of up to €6,250 per apartment, with a view to improving viability of apartment construction.  The enhanced deduction will be available in respect of a qualifying apartment block consisting of 10 or more apartments and is available for both new-build developments and conversion of non-residential buildings into a qualifying apartment block.  A claim may be made, on the company's corporation tax return, once the certificate of compliance on completion for the apartment block is lodged with the relevant local authority.  When making a claim, the company will be required to provide:  • details of the eligible expenditure incurred in respect of the apartment development,  • the number of apartments in the completed development, and  • such other information as Revenue may reasonably require.  As with all tax expenditures, data from tax returns will be used to assess the uptake and effectiveness of the measure. Other non-tax data, such as commencement and completion notices for apartment blocks potentially within scope of the measure, will also provide relevant data.  I would note however that, as this forms part of a suite of measures that have been introduced by the Government to stimulate the housing sector, it would be difficult to isolate and attribute specific impacts to any single measure.

Furthermore, the European Central Bank is prohibited from monetary financing under Article 123 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union. This is in place to safeguard the independence of the ECB.  In relation to our domestic situation, Ireland is making good progress towards the reduction of our debt burden, despite the impact of the pandemic, with the debt-to-GNI* ratio projected to fall to 58.6 per cent next year. The Economic and Fiscal Outlook of Budget 2026 projects interest expenditure of c.1 per cent of Ireland’s GNI*. Compared with other European countries, this is a relatively low level of interest expenditure, reflecting the relatively low debt burden. ",

        "answerText": " Minister for Education and Youth  The Department of Education and Youth, through various funding streams, continues to support youth services that provide vital developmental opportunities for young people across Dublin City. Youth funding is provided by the department through the City of Dublin Education and Training Board (CDETB), which plays a central role in coordinating and delivering youth services across the city. Since 2019, funding allocated by this department to youth services in the ETB area has increased by approximately 25.29%, rising from €16.17 million in 2019 to €20.26 million in 2025. This reflects our ongoing commitment to strengthening youth work provision and responding to the evolving needs of young people.  Youth funding allocations made available to City of Dublin Education and Training Board over the period 2016 to 2025 is provide in the table below:      Year    Allocation      2025    €20,262,364      2024    €19,160,666      2023    €19,012,567      2022    €19,153,097      2021    €17,575,925      2020    €16,744,730      2019    €16,172,325      2018*    €21,221,157      2017    €19,485,853      2016    €18,332,037     To provide a comprehensive picture of total youth service funding across all departments, further coordination and data collation will be required. The department will engage with the relevant bodies to request this information with a view to providing a more detailed response to the Deputy when information is received.  * Before 2019, CDETB managed all funding allocations for Youth Work Ireland and Involve, redistributing these funds to other ETBs nationwide. In 2019, this process changed: funding for these programs is now allocated directly to each ETB, reducing CDETB’s overall share. For context, between 2018 and 2019, CDETB’s funding decreased by €3,609,649 for Youth Work Ireland and €389,037 for Involve—amounts now distributed to other ETBs. This explains the apparent drop in CDETB’s allocation. ",

Since then, this calculation has been prepared and submitted annually to Government as part of preparations for the Budget.  The Government has also committed, under the Programme for Government - \"Securing Ireland’s Future\", to increase core welfare payments, ensuring that resources are also targeted at people who are unable to work over the lifetime of the Government. Consequently Budget 2026 included increases in core social welfare rates.  I trust this clarifies the matter for the Deputy. ",

        "answerText": " Minister for Social Protection  The Carer's Allowance payment is an income support for carers those who cannot earn an adequate income in the open labour market due to their caring responsibilities.  In this regard it forms part of the system of social assistance supports that provide payments based on income need.  It is not a payment for caring and the question of a basic income for caring does not fall within my remit.  There are currently 103,696 people in receipt of Carer's Allowance.  Expenditure on the scheme this year is estimated to exceed €1.24 billion.  Considerable progress has been made in recent years to support carers, including providing increases in the rates of payment and income disregards.  The current rate for Carer’s Allowance is one the higher rates within the social welfare system.  As part of Budget 2026, I announced a further €10 increase in the weekly rate of Carer’s Allowance, bringing the basic rate to €270, or €308 for carers aged 66 and over.  Recipients will also receive a Christmas bonus of a double week's payment in December.  Weekly carer income support payment rates have increased by €51 over the past five years.  The Programme for Government contains a commitment to progressively increasing weekly carer income support payments.  It is important to note that a 50% increase is applied to the weekly personal rate where care is provided to more than one person.  For carers with children the Child Support Payment also applies.  The highest weekly income disregard also applies to the Carer's Allowance payment.  At the start of July when the weekly income disregard increased from €450 to €625 for a single person, and from €900 to €1,250 for carers with a spouse or partner.  As part of Budget 2026, I announced more improvements to the means test that will be introduced next year.  For carers who work, the weekly income disregard will be increased by 60% from €625 to €1,000 for a single person, and from €1,250 to €2,000 for carers with a spouse/partner/co-habitant.  Since June 2022, this will amount to cumulative increases to the disregards of €667.50 for a single carer and €1,335 for a carer who is part of couple, or an increase of just over 200%.  These are the largest ever increases in the Carer’s Allowance income disregard and will mean that even people with what are considered to be relatively high incomes will qualify for a carer’s payment for the first time.  The Programme for Government commits to significantly increasing the income disregards with a view to abolishing over the lifetime of this Dáil.  My department also makes a number of non-means-tested income supports to carers including the annual Carer's Support Grant, the monthly Domiciliary Care Allowance payment and the weekly social insurance based Carer's Benefit.  All of which have seen increases in rates and or widening of eligibility criteria over the last number of years.  I am satisfied that my department provides a comprehensive suite of income supports to carers and that these apply across a range of income brackets.  I trust this clarifies the issue for the Deputy.

        "answerText": " Minister for Social Protection  The Government is committed to supporting disabled people into secure and sustainable employment. It is critical that the welfare-to-work journey is as smooth as possible for those who want to and are able to work.  As a result of Budget 2026, where people move off Disability Allowance or Blind Pension and into employment they will be able to retain their Fuel Allowance payment for up to five years.  In addition, where such people have children, they will now be eligible for the Back to Work Family Dividend which pays the equivalent of their Child Support Payment in year one and half of that amount in year two, for up to a maximum of four children.  Disability Allowance has been structured to support recipients to pursue employment opportunities, be that self-employment or insurable employment.  People in receipt of Disability Allowance can take up employment or self-employment and continue to receive all or part of their social welfare payment, depending on their income.  A person can earn up to €165 a week and keep their full rate of Disability Allowance and up to €517.60 a week and still keep their entitlement to the minimum rate of payment and their secondary benefits.  Partial Capacity Benefit allows a person who is in receipt of Illness Benefit for 26 weeks, or Invalidity Pension to enter or return to employment or self-employment and to continue to receive a partial or full payment.  Partial Capacity Benefit has been designed so there are no restrictions or limits on earnings from employment or on the number of hours a person can work.  As well as income supports, my Department offers a range of employment supports to enable disabled people access to the workplace and provide ongoing support to help them retain employment.  The Intreo service is a single point of contact for all employment and income supports in the State.  Disabled people can access mainstream employment schemes such as Community Employment and Tús as well as referral to tailored supports such as Employability, a service that offers a professional job-matching service, on-going support and advice and information on employment supports for disabled people.  Disabled people can meet with a Designated Disability Employment Personal Advisor to discuss employment and training options.  There is now a Designated Disability Employment Personal Advisor in each of the 62 Intreo offices nationwide.  Launched in 2024, the new Work and Access scheme addresses barriers to the workplace for disabled people and offers continuous support. Seven supports are available for disabled people and their employers including job coaches, work equipment, communication support and training.  Supports are available for both the business premises and remote workplaces.  The Wage Subsidy Scheme supports employers to hire disabled people through a subsidy.  In August 2024, my Department published a review of the scheme to make it more accessible and flexible.  As a result, the minimum hours for the scheme were reduced from 21 to 15 hours.  The scheme was expanded to some of those on Partial Capacity Benefit and to the community and voluntary sector.  An additional €3.7 million has been allocated to the scheme. In June this year, we launched the revamped scheme.  A media campaign to raise awareness of this very beneficial scheme for employers and employees followed the launch.  It is hoped that the implementation of the recommendations of the review will result in an expansion of the scheme and support more disabled people into work.  Budget 2026 has provided for a further expansion to people who acquire a disability while in employment and to those who transfer from Invalidity Pension to Partial Capacity Benefit and provided for an increase in the subsidy rates.  We also reduced the number of bands from six to three and increased the subsidy rates across all bands.  As a result, most of the employers in receipt of the subsidy will see their level of subsidy increase by €1.20, from €6.30 to €7.50 per hour.  My Department is committed to supporting disabled people into employment and the Government recognises that more needs to be done for disabled people who want to work.  The Programme for Government commits to expanding successful programmes like WorkAbility and Work and Access and to work with employers and across Government to improve employment of disabled people and this commitment is echoed the recently published National Human Rights Strategy for Disabled People 2025-2030.  These commitments will be advanced over the lifetime of the Government in light of the prevailing policy and budgetary context.  I trust this clarifies the position of the Deputy. ",

As Minister for Health, I am determined to support our screening programmes, which are a valuable part of our health service, enabling early treatment and care for many people, and improving the overall health of our population.  Currently, all babies (between 3 and 5 days old) are offered newborn bloodspot screening (generally known as the ‘heel prick’ test), which tests for nine rare but serious conditions that are treatable if detected early in life. The Programme for Government commits to continually reviewing the number of conditions babies are screened for.  Incremental progress continues to be made on the expansion of the National Newborn Bloodspot Screening Programme (NNBSP). In 2023, two recommendations from the National Screening Advisory Committee (NSAC) on the addition of Severe Combined Immunodeficiency (SCID) and Spinal Muscular Atrophy (SMA) to the NNBSP were approved.  In Budget 2024, an additional €1.4 million of new development funding was provided to support the SMA/SCID implementation process. Once both conditions have been fully implemented, the number of conditions screened for in Ireland will increase to 11.  In terms of the current implementation status, the HSE has advised that the equipment needed to enable the roll-out testing for SMA and SCID has been purchased, delivered and successfully installed at the newborn screening laboratory and significant progress continues with regards to the laboratory verification process. The recruitment process to hire the additional staff required to support the expansion of the NNBSP has been completed and work continues on developing screening pathways for both conditions.  In relation to concerns raised around the length of the implementation process, it should be emphasised that Ireland is not taking longer than other comparable countries to assess and implement additions to the NNBSP.  The Health Council of the Netherlands first recommended screening for SMA in 2019 and implementation was completed three years later in October 2022. In the United States of America, it took six years to fully implement SMA screening after it was added to the Recommended Uniform Screening Panel (RUSP) in 2018. In the United Kingdom, screening for SCID and SMA have been under consideration by the UK National Screening Committee since 2017 and 2018 respectively.  Nevertheless, I am acutely aware of how difficult it is for parents, families and children who have received a diagnosis of a rare disease, and how challenging daily life can be for them. This is why I remain committed to the further expansion of screening in Ireland in accordance with internationally accepted criteria and best practice. ",

        "answerText": " Minister of State at the Department of Health  A Healthy Weight for Ireland, the Obesity Policy and Action Plan (OPAP), was launched in September 2016 under the auspices of the Healthy Ireland Framework (Healthy Ireland: A Framework for Improved Health and Wellbeing 2013-2025). OPAP covers a 10-year period up to 2025 and aims to reverse obesity trends, prevent associated health risks, and reduce the overall burden for individuals, families, the health system, and the wider society and economy. It recognises that obesity is a complex, multi-faceted challenge and needs a multi-pronged response, with every sector of society playing its part.  Since the implementation of OPAP, levels of obesity and overweight have stabilised in Ireland.  According to the Healthy Ireland Survey 2024, the rate of obesity (for all ages from 15 years old) is at 21% and the rate of overweight at 35%. This data is collected every second year of the Healthy Ireland survey and overweight and obesity rates have been just under 60% for a number of years. There has been little change in our rates since OPAP was launched.  Data for children is collected separately through the WHO Childhood Obesity Surveillance Initiative (COSI) – the latest round, published last year shows that overall, one in five primary school children are now living with overweight or obesity, a small overall improvement over the lifetime of the OPAP. However, this figure remains at one in four for children in DEIS schools.  It is welcome that obesity rates are not rising. However, given the projected increase to the overall population and in particular the aging profile of our population, with greater numbers of older adults living with the health impacts of overweight and obesity in the coming decades, it is key that we seek to reduce the prevalence of overweight and obesity to reduce associated risks and costs to future healthcare.  Work on the drafting of a successor to OPAP is well underway. Several workshops and focus groups with stakeholders have been held to date, with a public consultation on draft strategic priorities held during August and September 2025. As a new policy has developed over the course of this year, research gaps and evidence-needs have been reviewed and will be taken into consideration in the next obesity policy to ensure all initiatives are evidence-based.  The new strategy will aim to capture all aspects relating to supporting a healthier weight for everyone in Ireland, including, but not limited to, education, health promotion, obesity prevention, with a particular focus on enabling measures for a healthier food environment and continuing the implementation of the HSE Model of Care for the Management and Treatment of Overweight and Obesity.
