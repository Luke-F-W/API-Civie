        "answerText": " Minister for Transport  As the Deputy may be aware, BusConnects is a transformative programme of investment in the bus system, providing better bus services across our cities, including Dublin. BusConnects is the largest investment in the bus system in the history of the State and is managed by the National Transport Authority (NTA).  Following on from three rounds of public consultation which concluded in 2020, new bus services in Dublin have been delivered, with the first seven phases of the Network Redesign rolled out in recent years. The most recent phase, Phase 7, which commenced in October 2025, saw the introduction of the F Spine connecting Finglas to Tallaght.  Matters relating to bus service delivery and planning, including the B Spine, fall under the remit of the NTA, in co-operation with the relevant transport operator, and are subject to funding and/or resource availability.  Noting the NTA's responsibility in the matter, I have referred the Deputy's questions to the NTA for a direct reply. Please contact my private office if you do not receive a reply within 10 days. ",

Anti-social behaviour is a serious issue, to which public transport is unfortunately not immune.  As the Deputy may be aware, the individual operators are responsible for the management of anti-social behaviour and the implementation of safety measures on their services. In all cases, issues of safety and concerns about anti-social behaviour are taken very seriously by the National Transport Authority (NTA), who a responsible for the organisation of public transport services, and by all operators across the public transport network. Passengers are encouraged to report all incidences of anti-social behaviour and safety concerns to the operators through the TFI Customer Service Team.  Due to Dublin Bus's responsibility for the management of anti-social behaviour and safety dangers on their services, I have forwarded the Deputy's question to them for direct reply. Please advise my private office if you do not receive a response within ten working days.  The Government is committed to delivering a safe and secure public transport network. In this regard, my Department is actively progressing the legislative proposals required to deliver on the Government’s commitment to establish a Transport Security Force and is working closely with the NTA in this regard. The introduction of this Force will require the development of legislation, which can have a significant lead time, but it will be expedited. This legislation is expected to progress during 2026, with a view to having the Force operational by 2027. I hope to update Cabinet in early 2026 on the progress of the work that my Department has carried out on the Transport Security Force. ",

        "answerText": " Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Tourism and Employment  The European Commission’s 2025 Annual Report on the State of the Digital Decade, published in June 2025, provides a comparative view of Ireland’s digitalisation progress relative to other EU Member States. The findings indicate that Irish businesses perform well overall, but there is room for improvement.  On measures of AI adoption, 13.8% of Irish SMEs report using AI, which is above the EU average of 12.6%. This has increased steeply from 2023, when only 8% of SMEs reported using AI.  More detailed CSO analysis indicates that while the pace of AI adoption over 2024 has been rapid, a strong digital divide is apparent. 25% of medium (50 or more employed), and 12% of small sized enterprises were using AI compared to almost 51% of larger companies.  The Expert Group on Future Skills Needs (EGFSN) report, AI and the Irish Labour Market , was published in November 2025. A key finding of the report is that enterprise usage of AI has surged, with adoption rates doubling in recent years.  There is currently no specific assessment of AI adoption within the retail sector.  The National Digital and AI Strategy is currently being updated and will have a significant emphasis on AI throughout. A key priority of the Strategy will be to enable SMEs to harness AI to improve productivity, drive efficiencies and enhance competitiveness.  To support this transition, a wide range of enterprise supports are already in place:  • The Grow Digital Voucher offers up to €5,000 to small businesses (under 50 employees) to adopt digital tools like e-commerce, AI, cybersecurity, and website development.  • The Digital for Business consultancy scheme —a free service which connects businesses with expert advisors to assess needs and develop tailored plans.  • The Grow Digital Portal showcases success stories from non-tech businesses embracing digital transformation.  • Ireland’s four European Digital Innovation Hubs (Dublin, Cork, Mullingar, Sligo) help SMEs and public bodies adopt key technologies: AI, cybersecurity, and high-performance computing.  • The Cyber Security Review Grant (worth €3,000), to help businesses strengthen their online security.  Finally, the establishment of a new AI Office of Ireland in 2026, an independent statutory entity which will be the central coordinating authority for the EU AI Act, will be a major milestone, providing clarity and regulatory certainty for enterprise. A critical function of the Office will be to act as the focal point for responsible AI innovation and adoption in Ireland. ",

        "answerText": " Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Tourism and Employment  As the Deputy will be aware, the EU Artificial Intelligence (AI) Act (Regulation (EU) 2024/1689) entered into force in August 2024 and establishes a harmonised regulatory framework for AI systems developed or deployed in the EU. Its provisions will apply in a phased manner through to August 2027. The Government is fully committed to the comprehensive and timely implementation of all aspects of the AI Act, including the establishment of the national AI regulatory sandbox.  The AI Act stipulates that Member States should ensure that their competent authorities establish at least one AI regulatory sandbox at national level, to be operational by 2 August 2026. This obligation can also be fulfilled by participating in a joint programme with other Member States.  Government has agreed to adopt a distributed model of competent authorities, utilising the State's established sectoral regulatory bodies to undertake supervisory and enforcement functions under the AI Act. My Department is coordinating national implementation efforts across Government, working with colleagues in other departments to establish the optimal configuration of competent authorities to ensure comprehensive, robust and efficient implementation in Ireland. To date, thirteen public bodies have been designated as market surveillance authorities and four as notifying authorities. My Department has been designated to act as Ireland's Single Point of Contact, as required by the AI Act, to facilitate coordination and provide centralised functions for the distributed model until the AI Office of Ireland is established on a statutory basis.  The new AI office of Ireland will act as the central coordinating body for EU AI Act and provide a focal point for the promotion and adoption of transparent and safe AI in Ireland, to help leverage the strategic opportunity that AI presents. This office will help facilitate coordination among regulators, while the enforcement of the AI Act remains the responsibility of the designated, sectoral regulators. The AI Office of Ireland will also be responsible for ensuring competent authorities establish a national AI regulatory sandbox.  The EU AI Board, a governance body of the AI Act, has established a dedicated subgroup to provide guidance on the role out of AI regulatory sandboxes across the EU. My officials are actively participating in that subgroup which will inform to protocols and practices necessary to establish the operation of the national AI regulatory sandbox.  My Department will also continue to engage with the European Commission, other member states, industry, and our regulators to explore opportunities for collaboration and participate in a joint AI regulatory sandbox. However, our immediate priority is to ensure that domestic capabilities are securely established for this pioneering project. This approach also reflects the consensus view among Member States that establishing effective domestic sandbox frameworks remains the priority to meet the August 2026 deadline.  The AI Regulatory Sandbox aims to help Irish businesses, especially SME's and startups, across all sectors to understand and navigate the AI regulations they need to comply with, in order to bring new products and services to the market. The Sandbox activity will also provide hands-on opportunities to Irish regulators to gain greater insights into the ongoing trends and developments within the AI systems in Ireland.  It is important to note that throughout the process of developing the AI Act, consideration has been given to the circumstances and needs of SMEs. Member States must provide priority access to the AI regulatory sandboxes for SMEs as well as establish dedicated channels for communication to support SMEs throughout their development journey by providing guidance and responding to queries about the implementation of this Regulation.

        "answerText": " Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Tourism and Employment  Under the EU Artificial Intelligence Act, the European Commission holds exclusive competency in relation to General Purpose AI (GPAI), including responsibility for supervising and enforcing obligations for providers.  In July 2025 the European Commission published the GPAI Code of Practice and guidelines following extensive stakeholder consultation at EU level, ensuring broad input from industry, civil society, and Member States. The GPAI Code of Practice is a voluntary tool designed to help industry comply with the AI Act’s obligations for providers of general-purpose AI Models.  The guidelines reflect the Commission's interpretation and will guide enforcement. They are designed to help stakeholders across the AI value chain innovate with clarity and confidence and businesses can access the official guidance directly. The guidelines provide clear definitions, including straightforward technical criteria to help developers understand their obligations under the AI Act. They take a pragmatic approach by clarifying that only those making significant modifications to AI models are subject to GPAI provider obligations. Additionally, the guidelines outline conditions under which open-source AI model providers are exempt from certain obligations, supporting transparency and innovation.  My Department actively contributed to the development of these guidelines, drawing on significant expertise and insights gained through the ongoing implementation of the AI Act in Ireland.  Obligations for providers of general-purpose AI models entered into application on 2 August 2025. Providers of GPAI models placed on the market after this date must comply and are encouraged to adhere to the voluntary code of practice to achieve compliance, with support available from the EU AI Office.  From 2 August 2026, the Commission’s enforcement powers will come into effect. From that date, the Commission will have powers to enforce compliance with the obligations for providers of GPAI models, including the application of fines for infringements. By 2 August 2027, providers of GPAI models placed on the market before 2 August 2025 must also achieve compliance.  In respect of guidance for Member States, the European Commission has launched an online Single Information Platform, which provides online interactive tools to help stakeholders determine whether they are subject to legal obligations and understand the steps they need to take to comply. The Platform is part of the AI Act Service Desk, which has been launched as a central initiative to help stakeholders navigate the AI Act requirements. This portal will serve as a key resource for Irish stakeholders seeking clarity on obligations and best practices under the EU framework.  Additionally, the National AI Office of Ireland will be established to act as the central and co-ordinating authority for the EU AI act in Ireland and will be the national Single Point of Contact. Key functions of this Single Point of Contact will be to streamline coordination between the various Irish regulators, the European Commission, and stakeholders for the AI Act and will help to raise awareness and inform all stakeholder groups, to help foster the uptake and adoption of AI.

        "answerText": " Minister for Education and Youth  The major building project referred to by the Deputy will be delivered under my Department's ADAPT Programme. The ADAPT Programme uses a professional external Project Manager to co-ordinate and drive the Design Team to achieve the best possible timeframe for the project through the stages of Architectural Planning to Tender and Construction.  The Brief for this project is the development of a 32 Classroom Primary School with 4 classrooms for pupils with Special Educational Needs including Pyrite Remediation, the Refurbishment of Existing Buildings and the construction of a New Build Extension and all associated site works, including associated play areas.  The major building project is currently at an early stage of architectural planning - Stage 1 - Preliminary Design, where the design team assess the site and current buildings, and prepare their initial sketch schemes. A preferred design option, including the scope and extent of works to be carried out will be established during this early stage, to be then further detailed and developed and fully cost-planned, before seeking statutory approvals, including planning permission.  Interim Stage 1 architectural workshops were held between the Design Team and the Department in Q4 2023, and the Design Team submitted their Stage 1 report to the Department in late Q4 2023.  Upon review of the report, a further detailed architectural workshop was held between the School Authorities, the Project Manager, Design Team and my Department in February 2024.  Following that meeting, the Design Team were requested to consider my Department's comments in relation to the site and design options presented.  Department Officials and Design Team members have met on site at St. Patrick's National School in attempts to develop appropriate design solutions that will best meet the needs of the school, and being cognisant of the 3rd party occupiers at the same site.  The Design Team are to prepare a revised Stage 1 submission, which upon receipt, will be reviewed, and a Stage 1 Stakeholders meeting will then be arranged.  In July the Government announced a capital allocation of €7.55 billion for the Department of Education and Youth for the period 2026-2030 under the National Development Plan. As part of this NDP allocation the department will place a strong emphasis on provision for children with special educational needs, with a particular focus on meeting annual school place needs. In relation to project rollout for Large-Scale projects and Additional School Accommodation scheme projects, the approach will be to continue to maximise the capacity of the existing school estate as much as possible in the first instance and provide necessary additional capacity through targeted and prioritised project rollout over the course of 2026 to 2030 period to meet the most urgent and prioritised needs.  Government support for this investment, including by way of supplementary capital funding, has delivered real benefits for school communities. Supplementary capital funding of €210 million approved by Government has brought the total capital allocation for 2025 for my department to €1.6 billion.  Government departments are currently in the process of publishing their sectoral NDP Implementation Plans. The sectoral plan for the Education and Youth sector will be published next week and the first tranche of projects to progress to construction will be published in January. This NDP Implementation Plan will optimise outputs from the NDP allocations, with a strong focus on maximising existing school capacity, progressing priority projects where local capacity across schools in the area is insufficient, and ensuring delivery that is affordable, offers value for money, and meets functional needs.

The Code contains a general obligation for Video Sharing Platforms to use age verification (including age estimation) to protect minors from content that could impair the mental, moral or physical development where it is appropriate.  Coimisiún na Meán determines when it is appropriate for a platform to use age verification. So to support this, officials in this Department are working with the Government’s Chief Information Officer and his office to look at practical technical solutions to age verification as part of the Government's digital wallet being developed using MyGovID. In doing so, we must seek to ensure interoperability and respect users' rights, including data protection rights.  The OGCIO is leading on the technical aspects of an envisaged pilot which will be run on a voluntary basis.

The primary role of the NCSC is to monitor, detect and respond to cyber security incidents of all types in the State, and to build cyber resilience.  Between 2024 and 2025, the National Cyber Security Centre successfully initiated and ran a pilot grants scheme, cofunded with the EU under the Digital Europe Programme, to support cyber security resilience in the SME sector. Over €1.8m was awarded to 51 SMEs. The pilot scheme has resulted in increased cyber security for the beneficiaries of the scheme and has stimulated the cyber security services sector.  The NCSC was granted funding under the National Development Plan to further develop supports for SMEs, and an extended support scheme will be launched in 2026 – the precise timing for the launch of this scheme remains to be decided. The goal of this scheme will be to further improve resilience and cyber security across the country, providing financial support to SMEs to implement cyber security improvements, or remediations, to their existing technological infrastructure, or governance and skills frameworks.  Alongside this, the NCSC will continue to work with the European Network and Information Security Agency (ENISA), to deliver targeted incidence preparedness and response actions for NIS2 obliged entities, implementing its mandate as derived from the Cyber Solidarity Act.  As part of the national Cyber Security Co-Ordination and Response Network Project (CyberCORE, a €3.3m three year EU co-funded programme), the NCSC will be shortly launching an SME CORE website. This website will serve as a centralised resource for all SMEs in the state. This site will contain guidelines, advice and video content on cyber security hygiene and best practice for SMEs.  A risk assessment tool will be available to assist SMEs in pinpointing the three most critical areas of cybersecurity that need their focus. In addition, SMEs will be able to ask a specific cyber question and receive a tailored answer using an ‘Ask the Expert’ form. ",

        "answerText": " Minister for Justice, Home Affairs and Migration  The 2025 National Cyber Risk Assessment (NCRA), published by my Department’s National Cyber Security Centre on 2 December will be the foundation of Ireland's third National Cyber Security Strategy.  Ireland’s second National Cyber Security Strategy sets out 20 collaborative measures with the aim of meeting a range of objectives, including to improve the ability of the State to respond to and manage cyber security incidents and to improve the resilience and security of public sector IT systems to better protect data and services. A Mid-Term Review of the Strategy published in May 2023 saw the inclusion of a further 18 new measures to be met within its lifetime. I expect to be in a position to publish the End-of-Strategy report shortly.  Preparations for a new third National Cyber Security Strategy are underway in my Department. This strategy will also incorporate obligations arising from the revised EU Network and Information Security Directive (NIS2 Directive) alongside other national commitments relating to cyber security such as those set out in the Programme for Government and the National Development Plan.  A number of recommendations in the 2025 NCRA reflect measures which I expected to feature in the new Strategy including: the establishment of a national cyber security research centre of excellence, use of the cyber fundamentals framework to embed security by design and risk management practices in the State to secure critical supply chains and the implementation of National Cyber Security Bill, which will embed a robust framework of cyber security and resilience across 18 sectors of criticality in the State.  A public consultation process will be launched soon to gather input from citizens, academia, industry, and other key stakeholders. These submissions will be reviewed and taken into consideration throughout the process of formulating priorities and specific measurable goals for the third Strategy.  Officials in my Department are currently engaged with the National Cyber Security Centre as well as other relevant Government Departments and agencies including the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade and the Department of Defence on developing this strategy.  Care will be taken throughout the strategy development process to ensure appropriate alignment with other relevant strategies including the Maritime Security Strategy and the Digital and AI Strategy.  I expect to be in a position to bring the third National Cyber Security Strategy to Government in early 2026, after which it will be published. ",

        "answerText": " Minister of State at the Department of Education and Youth  The National Council for Special Education (NCSE) is the statutory body responsible for the provision of special education and allocating supports for children with special educational needs.  In working to develop a more inclusive education system, 15,000 special education teachers have been provided to schools to support students to attend their local mainstream schools. In practical terms this means schools get a substantial additional teaching allocation to support students with special education needs such as dyslexia who are in mainstream classes.  Circular 0039/2025 informs school management and patrons of measures introduced to support forward planning and reiterates the need for parents to inform the NCSE through the Parent Notify process that they are seeking a special educational placement for their child.  This notification process will provide the NCSE with critical information on children who continue to need a special class as they progress to post-primary level as well as details on students who require a place for the first time. This year to facilitate earlier sanctioning of classes for the 2026/27 school year and provide certainty for families an earlier date of 1 October was set for parents to complete the process.  The NCSE is undertaking analysis of information including that provided through the Parents Notify process to plot demand for special class places for the 2026/27 school year. Once this analysis is completed the NCSE will be equipped to engage with schools to open new special classes in relevant areas. It is expected that these special classes will be sanctioned in the coming weeks.  This new timeline was publicised widely and communicated to schools and special education advocacy groups and parent representative bodies. The NCSE also undertook a lot of work at local level to ensure that families were aware of the timeline and process and consequently report a significant level of engagement and contact from families ahead of the 1 October closing date.  The NCSE advise that the majority of children and young people coming to them through the Parent’s Notify process are already enrolled in school supported by existing special education teachers and special needs assistants.  As with other applications for support, it is important that those who come forward after the closing date are assured that they are not forgotten or excluded from the system. The NCSE remains available to provide advice and support to all families seeking specialist placement and will continue to examine where provision is required for the 2026/27 school year.  My department and the NCSE are committed to ensuring that sufficient special education placements remain available for children with special educational needs and the need for new specialist provision is subject to ongoing review.

        "answerText": " Minister for Education and Youth  The rollout of Apply to School marks a significant step towards fulfilling the Programme for Government commitment to introduce a nationwide common application system.  In recent years, demographic shifts and increasing demand for special class provision for students with special educational needs have placed growing pressure on school admissions across the country. Duplicate applications, families choosing specific schools, and students applying from outside the local area can make it seem like schools are more full than they are. These factors can give an incomplete picture of how many places are available in schools.  In response to these challenges and a commitment in the Programme for Government to reforming the admissions process, my department is working towards a nationwide common application system.  As a first step, the Apply to School pilot was introduced to simplify and improve the admissions process for post-primary schools in five pilot areas. This new system provides families, for the first time, with a single online application and introduces synchronised, streamlined timelines for schools to manage admissions, issue offers, and update a central database to record accepted places. Other areas will be taken into consideration for future iterations of the pilot.  I wish to advise the Deputy that schools continue to operate in line with the Education (Admission to Schools) Act 2018 and their own Admissions Policies. Under this process, some applicants may receive more than one offer, while others may not receive an offer until later in the process. The centralised system helps identify duplicate acceptances and supports families in achieving certainty on school places earlier.  The Department will closely monitor the outcomes of the admissions process to ensure that all local children are accommodated and to identify any required solutions if necessary. The Apply to School pilot will provide early clarity and robust data to support this commitment.  Learnings from the implementation of the pilot will inform the way forward for future iterations and deliver on the Programme for Government commitment, including for post primary level in Dublin 15.  I can assure the Deputy department officials will continue to work in consultation with stakeholders to develop an evidence-informed, tested, equitable solution for a nationwide Common Application System and to deliver this in an incremental way that ensures the admissions process safeguards the best interest of children.

        "answerText": " Minister for Education and Youth  In order to plan for school provision and analyse the relevant demographic data, my department divides the country into 314 school planning areas (SPA) and uses a geographical information system, using data from a range of sources, including CSO census data, child benefit and school enrolment data, to identify where the pressure for school places across the country will arise and where additional school accommodation is needed at primary and post-primary level.  Major new residential developments have the potential to alter the demand for school places at a local level. In that regard, as part of the demographic demand analysis, my department monitors planning and construction activity in the residential sector. This involves the analysis of data sources from local authorities and the CSO along with the engagement with local authorities and the construction sector. In this way, up-to-date information on significant new residential developments is obtained and factored into the demographic analysis exercise. This is necessary to ensure that schools infrastructure planning is keeping pace with demographic changes, at a local level, where there is a constantly evolving picture with planned new residential development.  Laurel Lodge and Carpenterstown are in the Carpenterstown_D15 SPA. According to Child Benefit data in this School Planning Area (SPA) there are approximately 2,273 year old and 2,354 year olds that are likely to require junior infant places in the coming years. Porterstown is located in the BlanchardstownVge_D15 SPA. According to Child Benefit data there are approximately 3,443 year olds and 4,024 year olds living in this SPA likely to require junior infant places in the coming years.  The availability of places is a matter for each individual school in the context of admissions legislation and their admissions policies. Enrolment data for previous school years is available on the Department website. Enrolment data for the 2024/2025 school year is available on the Departments website at www.gov.ie.  Each school is required to publish an Annual Admission Notice, which sets out the number of places available for first year for the relevant academic year. These notices are published by the schools themselves and are publicly accessible. ",

At the end of October, the total Garda personnel strength stood at a record level of over 18,000, which included 14,290 Gardaí, 3,487 Garda Staff, and 291 Reserves. I will continue to support An Garda Síochána to increase this number further so that we can see more Gardaí assigned all across the country.

The fishing sector in particular is highly dependent on a healthy marine environment, and its own environmental impacts, where relevant, need to be managed in an appropriate manner.  The majority of the marine Natura 2000 sites in Ireland are inshore, within six nautical miles. It is important to note that Natura 2000 sites can include a variety of habitats and species, each with varying sensitivities and in respect of introducing measures to manage sea-fisheries, regard must be had to the specific conservation objectives set out for each habitat and species within those sites.  I provide below in tabular form a list of the existing Natura 2000 sites (Special Areas of Conservation or Special Protection Areas) where bottom trawling has been restricted.

It is of note that EFSA has concluded that, while food allergies affect a relatively small proportion of the population, an allergic reaction can be severe, even potentially fatal and that it is increasingly apparent that people with food allergies or intolerances experience a very significant reduction in quality of life.  However, there are a number of official controls in place in Ireland relating to allergens. In addition, there are several Regulations at EU level setting out the responsibilities of food business operators regarding allergen management and food information.  FSAI routinely publishes “Allergen alerts” on its website (www.fsai.ie) and it also facilitates the direct notification of food allergen alerts for consumers who have subscribed through the FSAI website. The FSAI website also contains extensive literature, training material and other information on food allergens for enforcement officers, food businesses and consumers.  There are currently no plans to develop a national allergy strategy or national allergen register within the Department of Health. ",

        "answerText": " Minister for Health  In October 2015, the then Minister for Health signed The Medicinal Products (Prescription and Control of Supply) (Amendment) (No.2) Regulations 2015 (S.I. 449/2015) into effect. The regulations increase access to specified prescription-only medicines in an emergency including adrenaline. This allows for the administration of adrenaline for known or suspected anaphylaxis, to be administered by trained members of the public in emergency situations, without the need for a prescription. Of note, there is provision for organisations such as schools and workplaces to store these medications for the administration by a trained person.  The Pharmaceutical Society of Ireland provide guidance on the implementation of this amendment for pharmacists and the Pre Hospital Emergency Care Council has established a course for the education and training of persons to safely and competently administer adrenaline in an emergency.  There is a responsibility to ensure that medications are stored and administered safely and appropriately. Those with a known risk of anaphylaxis should carefully follow their doctor’s guidance regarding carrying an adrenaline pen (‘EpiPen’) on person.  Community pharmacies are among the most accessible and trusted healthcare providers in Ireland. The State recognises the importance of pharmacies being prepared to administer these medicines safely and effectively. This is reflected in the Community Pharmacy Agreement 2025 which establishes an Emergency Medicine Administration Preparedness Allowance. To recognise that community pharmacists are authorised to administer emergency medicines, and that this service is provided on an ad hoc basis requiring pharmacists to be trained and ready to respond, an annual recurring allowance of €525 will be made available to community pharmacy contractors, commencing in 2026.

        "answerText": " Minister for Health  I propose to take Questions Nos. 958 to 960, inclusive, together.  The Influenza Vaccination Programme provides a free flu vaccine to those most vulnerable to the effects of the flu.  Every year the WHO reviews global surveillance data and recommends the specific influenza strains that manufacturers should include in the season's vaccines based on the flu strains that are considered most likely to circulate.   Vaccine production takes several months and this allows the manufacturers sufficient time to have vaccine available in time for the start of the flu season.  All licensed influenza vaccines included for the 2025/2026 season comply with WHO and NIAC recommendations.  In 2024, HIQA carried out a Health Technology Assessment, or HTA, on enhanced flu vaccines.  The HTA noted that studies on the effectiveness of enhanced flu vaccines are limited due to the small number of studies and a paucity of data over multiple seasons.  Due to the variability of seasonal influenza, a single study may misrepresent the 'on average' vaccine effectiveness.  Based on the limited data available, the HTA found that switching from a standard to an enhanced flu vaccine for those aged 65 and older would likely reduce the burden of flu. Whether such a switch would represent a good use of public monies would depend on the price of these enhanced vaccines compared with the standard flu vaccine.  Overall, ECDC reported low to moderate relative vaccine effectiveness for the adjuvanted influenza vaccine against laboratory confirmed influenza and against laboratory confirmed influenza related hospitalisation. They concluded that the evidence of the relative vaccine effectiveness of enhanced influenza vaccines compared to standard vaccines is still limited and that further studies are needed to allow more substantial conclusions on the potential benefits of enhanced influenza vaccines.  It should be noted that the UK is experiencing a significant influenza A wave with medium-level impact in terms of hospitalisations up to 29 November 2025. This is in context of a programme using enhanced influenza vaccines.  Australia also offered enhanced influenza vaccines and experienced a severe flu season.  In Ireland amongst both hospitalised influenza cases with severe acute respiratory infection and ICU admissions due to influenza this season, where influenza vaccination status was known, 73% had not received the current season influenza vaccine.  For those in recommended groups, the influenza vaccine currently offered as part of the Influenza Vaccination Programme reduces the risk of serious illness and death from influenza. Ensuring high vaccine coverage is the key public health intervention that is required. While Ireland performs well compared to other countries in Europe, achieving high vaccine coverage in older age groups, it is essential that all those in recommended groups continue to be supported and encouraged to avail of the influenza vaccine.  The HSE was asked to commence a tender process to determine if the enhanced vaccines could be purchased at a price that was cost effective and from within their existing budget. The HSE carried out an analysis of the tenders received and on 4 February 2025, advised the Department that neither of the enhanced vaccines for older people met the criteria set out in the HTA for net monetary benefit compared to standard flu vaccine and was over twice the price of the standard flu vaccine.  The HIQA HTA estimates increasing costs of procurement of the enhanced influenza vaccines at between approximately 4 and 19 million euros/year. Actual costs are commercially confidential and are not known until tenders are evaluated each year.  The healthcare budget is finite. Decisions regarding increased spending in one area could impact the provision of other health technologies and treatments within the healthcare system. Therefore, cost-effectiveness must be considered in any decision-making process.  The introduction of an enhanced vaccine can be reconsidered when the cost effectiveness is more favourable. ",

        "answerText": " Minister for Health  I propose to take Questions Nos. 958 to 960, inclusive, together.  The Influenza Vaccination Programme provides a free flu vaccine to those most vulnerable to the effects of the flu.  Every year the WHO reviews global surveillance data and recommends the specific influenza strains that manufacturers should include in the season's vaccines based on the flu strains that are considered most likely to circulate.   Vaccine production takes several months and this allows the manufacturers sufficient time to have vaccine available in time for the start of the flu season.  All licensed influenza vaccines included for the 2025/2026 season comply with WHO and NIAC recommendations.  In 2024, HIQA carried out a Health Technology Assessment, or HTA, on enhanced flu vaccines.  The HTA noted that studies on the effectiveness of enhanced flu vaccines are limited due to the small number of studies and a paucity of data over multiple seasons.  Due to the variability of seasonal influenza, a single study may misrepresent the 'on average' vaccine effectiveness.  Based on the limited data available, the HTA found that switching from a standard to an enhanced flu vaccine for those aged 65 and older would likely reduce the burden of flu. Whether such a switch would represent a good use of public monies would depend on the price of these enhanced vaccines compared with the standard flu vaccine.  Overall, ECDC reported low to moderate relative vaccine effectiveness for the adjuvanted influenza vaccine against laboratory confirmed influenza and against laboratory confirmed influenza related hospitalisation. They concluded that the evidence of the relative vaccine effectiveness of enhanced influenza vaccines compared to standard vaccines is still limited and that further studies are needed to allow more substantial conclusions on the potential benefits of enhanced influenza vaccines.  It should be noted that the UK is experiencing a significant influenza A wave with medium-level impact in terms of hospitalisations up to 29 November 2025. This is in context of a programme using enhanced influenza vaccines.  Australia also offered enhanced influenza vaccines and experienced a severe flu season.  In Ireland amongst both hospitalised influenza cases with severe acute respiratory infection and ICU admissions due to influenza this season, where influenza vaccination status was known, 73% had not received the current season influenza vaccine.  For those in recommended groups, the influenza vaccine currently offered as part of the Influenza Vaccination Programme reduces the risk of serious illness and death from influenza. Ensuring high vaccine coverage is the key public health intervention that is required. While Ireland performs well compared to other countries in Europe, achieving high vaccine coverage in older age groups, it is essential that all those in recommended groups continue to be supported and encouraged to avail of the influenza vaccine.  The HSE was asked to commence a tender process to determine if the enhanced vaccines could be purchased at a price that was cost effective and from within their existing budget. The HSE carried out an analysis of the tenders received and on 4 February 2025, advised the Department that neither of the enhanced vaccines for older people met the criteria set out in the HTA for net monetary benefit compared to standard flu vaccine and was over twice the price of the standard flu vaccine.  The HIQA HTA estimates increasing costs of procurement of the enhanced influenza vaccines at between approximately 4 and 19 million euros/year. Actual costs are commercially confidential and are not known until tenders are evaluated each year.  The healthcare budget is finite. Decisions regarding increased spending in one area could impact the provision of other health technologies and treatments within the healthcare system. Therefore, cost-effectiveness must be considered in any decision-making process.  The introduction of an enhanced vaccine can be reconsidered when the cost effectiveness is more favourable. ",
