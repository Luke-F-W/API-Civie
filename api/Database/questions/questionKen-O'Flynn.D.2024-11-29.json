        "answerText": " Tánaiste and Minister for Finance  The Central Bank of Ireland is the independent supervisor of all regulated financial service providers.  The Central Bank serves the public interest by safeguarding monetary and financial stability and by working to ensure that the financial system operates in the best interests of consumers and the wider economy. As part of its work the Central Bank engages with a range of stakeholders and, in particular, it works closely with the Department of Finance.  The Central Bank indicates that it is aware of the system generated error that affected certain former customers of Ulster Bank in relation to historical mortgage repayments. Under the Consumer Protection Code, regulated entities must correct errors and handle complaints speedily, efficiently and fairly.  The Central Bank expects all regulated firms to have robust systems and controls in place. When failures or breaches occur that impact customers, the Central Bank expects regulated entities to remediate and rectify without delay to ensure that customers are treated fairly and are put back in the position they would have been in had it not occurred.  If customers are not satisfied with the outcome of their engagement with their financial services provider they are entitled to lodge a complaint with the Financial Services and Pensions Ombudsman.

All CSRs are available at the following link: www.gov.ie/en/collection/cb885-social-housing-construction-projects-status-reports/  My Department assesses, approves and records local authority social housing delivery on a project basis, rather than on the basis of individual units. All publicly-funded construction programmes must comply with the Infrastructure Guidelines (Public Spending Code) and Capital Works Management Framework. My Department periodically issues Basic Unit Costs (BUCs) for each local authority area, for use as a key benchmark for the development and costing of scheme designs at capital appraisal stage. While not a record of actual delivery costs, BUCs are based on an analysis of returned data from tendered social housing schemes over an extended period and updated based on published tender index information as required.  To monitor tender cost trends and to inform BUC levels, my Department analyses the tender data for the construction cost element of new build schemes approved under the SHIP & CAS four stage approval processes for each unit type, where sufficient information is available to allow such costs to be extrapolated and where the information available is appropriate for comparison purposes. Costs for schemes will vary depending on design, mix of unit types as well as abnormal costs.  Further information may be available from individual local authorities. ",

Whilst the report shows a stabilisation in total development costs, Government recognises that these costs remain high.  Delivering Homes, Building Communities 2025-2030, contains significant initiatives to reduce costs of development including updated apartment design standards, reduced tax liabilities, VAT reduction on apartments and standardised design approaches which have the potential to result in significant cost savings making them more viable to construct.  A range of measures have been put in place to reduce the cost of construction for social housing including, promoting the use of Modern Methods of Construction, the review of the Planning Design Standards for Apartments Guidelines for Planning Authorities; the development of standardised designs for social housing, new procurement approaches, streamlined approval processes and measures to promote careers in construction.  Furthermore, a dedicated work programme will be established to systematically review all available information on development costs on an ongoing basis. The programme will assess the impact of the existing measures and inform future action to be taken to reduce costs and improve viability. This will involve engagement with the private sector and with policymakers across the system as appropriate. ",

        "answerText": " Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage  My Department assesses, approves and records local authority social housing delivery on a project basis, rather than on the basis of individual units. All publicly-funded construction programmes must comply with the Infrastructure Guidelines (Public Spending Code) and Capital Works Management Framework. My Department periodically issues Basic Unit Costs (BUCs) for each local authority area, for use as a key benchmark for the development and costing of scheme designs at capital appraisal stage. While not a record of actual delivery costs, BUCs are based on an analysis of returned data from tendered social housing schemes over an extended period and updated based on published tender index information as required.  To monitor tender cost trends and to inform BUC levels, my Department analyses the tender data for the construction cost element of new build schemes approved under the SHIP & CAS four stage approval processes for each unit type, where sufficient information is available to allow such costs to be extrapolated and where the information available is appropriate for comparison purposes. Costs for schemes will vary depending on design, mix of unit types as well as abnormal costs.  In relation to affordable housing, affordability and the chance to own a home is at the heart of Government’s housing policy, as embodied within the new housing plan, Delivering Homes, Building Communities 2025 – 2030. Government is investing an unprecedented level of funding to support housing supply, which will underpin, inter alia, the new Starter Homes Programme, delivering an average of 15,000 affordable housing supports annually to 2030.  Affordable housing solutions must deliver a significant discount on housing market purchase prices or rents while covering the cost of identifying, developing and delivering viable affordable housing schemes. As such, applications for affordable housing projects are assessed on their own merit in line with the criteria and conditions applicable under the different funding streams. Specific delivery costs per unit are variable and can greatly differ between both the affordable schemes themselves and the typology, location and overall layout of the developments in question.  My Department continues to receive and assess applications for suitability, value for money and compliance with the various requirements of the applicable funding scheme and the Department is committed to the provision of funding to local authorities and Approved Housing Bodies for the delivery of Social and Affordable housing projects.  Under Budget 2026, the total Exchequer funding being made available for the delivery of housing programmes is €7.21bn, comprising:  - Capital Funding - €5.19bn  - Current Funding - €2.021bn  The Exchequer Capital provision of €5.19bn will be supplemented by Land Development Agency (LDA) investment (projected up to €1.6bn) and Housing Finance Agency (HFA) lending (projected over €2bn), resulting in an overall capital provision of over €9bn.

        "answerText": " Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage  In 2023 my Department published the Residential Construction Cost Study Report, informed by in-depth analysis on residential construction costs under Housing for All. Within the study, Irish residential construction costs, processes and models were compared against four European comparator cities.  The Report identified a host of subsequent actions to drive down construction costs and maximise future building capacity through greater standardisation and the adoption of more efficient residential construction processes across tenures. A copy of the Report was published on my Department’s website at the following link: www.gov.ie/en/publication/2bf87-residential-construction-cost-study-report/  This report has been supplemented with the publication of the Total Development Cost Study in 2024 and the most recently published Insights into Total Development Cost Report 2025, which assesses residential development costs across six dwelling types for the Greater Dublin Area and four regional locations. This report is available to view on my Departments website at the following link: www.gov.ie/en/department-of-housing-local-government-and-heritage/publications/total-development-cost-report/  This Government is committed to delivering evidence informed policy decisions, this report will help deliver the initiatives that will see a reset in housing delivery on a scale that is needed. Whilst the report shows a stabilisation in total development costs, Government recognises that these costs remain high.  Delivering Homes, Building Communities 2025-2030, contains significant initiatives to reduce costs of development including updated apartment design standards, reduced tax liabilities, VAT reduction on apartments and standardised design approaches which have the potential to result in significant cost savings making them more viable to construct.  My Department periodically issues BUCs for each local authority area as key benchmarks for developing and costing housing scheme designs at the initial capital appraisal stage. They are not intended to be limits or ceilings on project costs, rather their function is to provide local authorities with guideline costings at an early stage of project development.  While not a record of actual delivery costs, BUCs are informed by analysis of returned tender data from tendered social housing schemes and reflect a ‘base build cost’, excluding abnormals (i.e. project specific requirements such as poor ground conditions, site topography, special needs requirements). Given the nature of construction, all projects would be expected to have some level of abnormal or project specific requirements. However, the extent of such requirements will vary significantly from project to project. ",

The subsequent need to manage a national campaign for everyone to receive a Covid vaccine in a very specific order, in particular locations, in mass vaccination clinics, hospitals, GP surgeries and community pharmacy, and within a shortest time possible, also put the health system and associated IT systems under pressure.  The HSE took steps to address this at the time and continues to invest in these systems for the future. At the time a new CRM solution was developed to provide a state of the art Track and Trace System. The legacy system used by HPSC could not be replaced to tactical actions were taken to respond to the emergency including additional ICT infrastructure and the use of BOTs to automate large volume data processing. A new Covid vaccination system was developed at pace and scale and with sufficient resilience to withstand the ransomware attack in May 2021, which affected many other HSE systems but meant the national vaccination campaign was largely unaffected.  Since that time a national Delivery Director has been in place with her team to accelerate delivery of IT systems in public health. The HPSC system is being replaced and the vaccination system is being developed so that it can cater for all programmes, not just Covid.  Whilst there is still much to be done, the team have a plan, funding and resources are being provided and they are getting on with delivery. ",

Under the Health Act 2004, primary responsibility for funding the Voluntary Hospitals (Section 38s) for the provision of healthcare services on behalf of the HSE, was placed with the HSE. As a result, primary oversight responsibility for the non-statutory bodies including the acute Hospitals is with the HSE and this includes dealing with issues relevant to the delivery of healthcare services as they arise.  Nevertheless, it is prudent for the Department to oversee governance of all aegis bodies including the HSE. The Department in conjunction with the Board of the HSE, conducts a quarterly high-level meeting which involves the CEO of the HSE, the Chair of the HSE Board, the Secretary General of the Department of Health and the Minister for Health.  At the most recent meeting in September 2025, compliance issues relating to the implementation of the new Integrated Financial Management System (IFMS) and other central HSE ICT systems were discussed. The Minister agreed to work with the HSE to resolve the matter. Following this meeting, progress has been achieved and the fifteen (15) larger Section 38 acute hospitals have completed Service Agreements with the HSE to include use of the IFMS and other central ICT systems.  The quarterly Ministerial meeting with HSE top management includes consideration of issues arising from the HSE Statement of Internal Control (SIC) as a standing agenda item. The HSE arrangements for governance of voluntary hospitals is not specifically included on the SIC and arises in the broader context of consideration of issues with potential to impact service delivery.  The Department holds a quarterly Risk Management meeting with the HSE at Officials level to discuss strategic and high-rated risks and the operation of the HSE Risk Register.  By using these meetings, the Department ensures that top level management in the HSE and the HSE Board are accountable to high standards in managing the delivery of healthcare services. ",

Drivers of trams must comply with the road speed limits that are applied under the Road Traffic Acts and with the speed limit regulations that are made under the Transport (Railway Infrastructure) Act 2001. A tram driver is a safety critical worker for the purposes of the Railway Safety Act 2005 and must comply with the safety obligations that apply under that Act.  To apply to drive a tram on a public road a tram driver is required to hold a valid driver licence that is issued under the Road Traffic Act 1961 i.e. a personal driving licence. The training and qualification of persons to drive a tram vehicle on the light railway infrastructure is arranged by the employer (the railway organisation that provides passenger light rail services). The Transport (Railway Infrastructure) Act 2001 provides that a person who is disqualified under the Road Traffic Acts for holding a driving licence is prohibited from driving a tram on a public road.

The Government, on 29 April 2025, agreed to establish the Housing Activation Office (HAO) within my Department to address the critical need to accelerate housing delivery by coordinating and progressing the key enabling infrastructure required for development.  I have now established this Office and its function is to coordinate and accelerate the delivery of infrastructure projects that are essential to unlock housing sites. The HAO includes experts seconded from Uisce Éireann, ESB Networks, the National Transport Authority, Transport Infrastructure Ireland and the local government sector, who will support the work of the office.  Since its establishment, the HAO has been actively engaging with all local authorities and relevant infrastructure agencies to identify and address barriers to housing delivery.  I will shortly be bringing forward a €1 billion Housing Infrastructure Investment Fund, which will provide targeted investment in enabling infrastructure. This new fund will complement existing investment by Uisce Éireann, ESB Networks and other agencies and will form part of a more coordinated, end-to-end approach to infrastructure delivery for housing. It will also operate alongside existing programmes such as the Local Infrastructure Housing Activation Fund and the Urban Regeneration and Development Fund.  The Office is currently working with local authorities to identify infrastructure projects needed to unlock key housing sites. This work is ongoing and the Office will prepare reports for the Minister in due course as to the information gathered. ",

Such extensions and/or additions within the prison estate are considered relatively cost effective, given the host of ancillary facilities and significant infrastructure already in place.  I am advised that the proposed site has temporary polytunnels in place which forms part of the horticulture programme operated within the prison. While plans and design intent are still at a very early stage, the construction of the new Prison Block will require these temporary facilities to be relocated in an adjacent location, in advance of the main construction works, in order to ensure that the horticulture programme will be minimally impacted.  The IPS have further advised that it is not the intention to close the horticulture programme. The Midlands Prison Horticulture Programme is a successful work training initiative which provides prisoners with valuable gardening and landscaping skills, offering therapeutic benefits, supporting community projects which the Irish Prison Service intend to continue. As the project progresses assessments, analysis and stakeholder engagements will be conducted as required. ",

        "answerText": " Minister for Justice, Home Affairs and Migration  As the Deputy will be aware Ireland has opted in to the EU Asylum and Migration Pact which is due to enter operation in June 2026. The Pact will provide a fair, sustainable and efficient asylum procedure. This will be achieved through convergence in asylum practices across the EU.  The EU Migration and Asylum Pact has been designed to enhance the Common European Asylum System and that is based on solidarity, responsibility, and respect for human rights.  My Department continues to focus on preparing for the implementation of the Pact in advance of June 2026.  On 11 November, the Commission published the first European Annual Asylum and Migration Report, the Commission Implementing Decision on Migratory Pressure, and a proposal for a Council Implementing Decision on the Annual Solidarity Pool which make up the first Annual Migration Management Cycle.  Under the solidarity mechanism  Member States will contribute to a Solidarity Pool on the basis of a proportional “fair share” principle (based on the formula 50% population and 50% GDP). It is very important to clarify that the “fair share” contribution for Ireland would apply to the solidarity pool to be established, not to the total number of asylum applications across the EU.  Member States will have discretion on the type of solidarity they contribute. This can take the form of relocations, financial contributions or alternative solidarity measures such as deployment of personnel.  I have decided that Ireland will not be accepting relocations given the pressures on our system but will make a financial contribution to support the EU Member States under the most extreme pressure.  In the Commission Implementing Decision on Migratory Pressure, Ireland was deemed to be ‘At Risk of Migratory Pressure’ and will have priority access to the EU Migration Support Toolbox. The Commission's assessment that Ireland is at risk of migratory pressure is in recognition of the fact that a significant proportion of international protection applicants enter the country arriving across the land border with Northern Ireland, together with the significant arrivals of persons benefitting from temporary protection.  The EU Migration Support toolbox offers tailor-made support to Member States including operational and technical support by EU bodies, offices and agencies; financial support and support to facilitate return and reintegration activities.
