        "answerText": " Minister for Finance  Firstly, I wish to assure the Deputy that I am aware of the issue of access to certain insurance services for individuals who have recovered from a serious illness. This is a very sensitive matter for many in our community and one that my Department monitors closely.  Officials in my Department engage regularly with Insurance Ireland – the official industry body – on a range of consumer issues, including the question raised by the Deputy. It has stated that insurers are obliged to assess the risk involved as part of any application for insurance, which will be specific to the individual applicant, and that the availability of cover depends on a number of factors. If higher risk is identified as a result of this assessment, Insurance Ireland has advised that the policy will be adjusted accordingly, and that cover may be declined if the applicant is judged to pose a risk beyond the insurer’s threshold.  In addition, Insurance Ireland published a Code of Practice for Underwriting Mortgage Protection Insurance for Cancer Survivors, which came into force on 6 December 2023. Under the Code, insurers will disregard a cancer diagnosis where treatment ended more than 7 years prior to application (or more than 5 years if the applicant was under 18 at the time of diagnosis). The Code will apply to mortgage cover applications of up to €500,000 for a principal private residence.  Separately, as the Deputy may be aware, under existing legislation (Section 126 of the Consumer Credit Act 1995), lenders are permitted to provide a mortgage in situations where a borrower may be unable to obtain life insurance, or where such insurance is unduly costly compared to that payable by borrowers generally. For individuals, including those living with certain medical conditions, and who may experience difficulties acquiring mortgage protection insurance when securing a home loan, this is an important provision to be aware of.  It may interest the Deputy to know that in order to assist clients who have had difficulty acquiring life cover due to a pre-existing illness, Brokers Ireland has published a register containing contact details of Brokers who have experience in advising on life cover in this area. This is available at: brokersireland.ie/life-cover-pre-existing-illnesses/  Additionally, Insurance Ireland operates a free information service for those customers who have queries, complaints or difficulties in relation to obtaining insurance cover, which can be contacted at feedack@insuranceireland.eu.

        "answerText": " Minister for Social Protection  The objective of the School Meals Programme is to provide regular, nutritious food to children to support them in taking full advantage of the education provided to them.  The programme is an important component of policies to encourage school attendance and extra educational achievement.  My priority as Minister was the roll out of Hot School Meals to all children in primary schools.  As part of this significant expansion plan, it was as announced in the recent Budget that Hot School Meals will be extended to all remaining primary schools in 2025, meaning that there will be 3,200 eligible schools in respect of 550,000 children.  All schools in receipt of school meals funding must sign and meet Service Level Agreements outlining their responsibilities under headings such as procurement and nutritional standards.  In 2023, I published an independent evaluation of the Programme which sets out the positive impact it is having in terms of children’s education and wellbeing.  This evaluation is evidence-based and sets out a series of recommendations for expanding the Programme into the future.  There is an overwhelming consensus among all participants in the evaluation that the Programme is effective, and it indicates strong support for extending the Programme.  The report also recommended an interim increase in funding rates for all meal options.  In response, I secured government approval for the following rate increases for the various meal options provided on the School Meals Programme effective from 1st January 2023:   • Breakfast  - increase from €0.60 to €0.75 (15c increase).  • Cold Lunch  - increase from €1.40 to €1.70 (30c increase).  • Dinner  - increase from €1.90 to €2.50 (60c increase).  • Hot School Meal - increase from €2.90 to €3.20 (30c increase).  These meals must meet the nutritional standards for the school meals programme.  The Nutritional Standards for School Meals were developed by a working group led by the Health and Wellbeing Programme in the Department of Health, in consultation with Safefood and the Healthy Eating and Active Living Programme in the Health Service Executive.  I trust this clarifies the matter. ",

        "answerText": " Minister for Social Protection  The introduction of an automatic enrolment (AE) retirement savings system is a Programme for Government commitment and a key priority for me as the Minister for Social Protection.  Implementation of the AE system is now well underway, with the enactment of the Automatic Enrolment Retirement Savings System Act 2024 and the signing of a contract with Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) to administer the AE system on behalf of the National Automatic Enrolment Retirement Savings Authority (NAERSA). In addition, I recently signed a Commencement Order to put into effect the provisions of the AE Act. This provides for the establishment of NAERSA on 31st March 2025 and the commencement of enrolments and contribution collection on the 30th September 2025.  The AE system is designed to complement rather than replace existing retirement savings provision. Employees who are already enrolled in a qualifying occupational scheme, PRSA, trust RAC or a PEPP will be exempt from AE.  In respect of occupational or company pension schemes, Section 772(2)(d) of the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997 (TCA) provides that one of the conditions for approval of such a pension scheme is that the employer must contribute to it. In addition, the AE Act provides for the introduction of exemption standards to be developed in consultation with the Pensions Authority within the first six years of the introduction of AE. These standards will, in time, ensure that the employee's pension will be at least on a par with, or will exceed, what is provided for through AE in order to continue to be exempt.  AE will provide a direct State top-up contribution of €1 for every €3 the employee contributes, which is the equivalent of 25% tax relief. Individuals who currently contribute to an alternative pension scheme through payroll, and who will therefore be exempt from AE, already receive support from the State through the provision of tax relief of up to 40% on their contributions, depending on their income tax rate.  I hope that this clarifies matters for the Deputy. ",

Social welfare legislation provides that means tests take account of the income and assets of the person (and their spouse or partner, if applicable) applying for the relevant scheme. The means assessment includes income from employment, self-employment, occupational pensions and maintenance payments. It also includes property owned other than the family home and capital such as savings, shares, and other investments.  Social welfare legislation provides for the disregard of certain compensation awards when assessing the means of a person.  These disregards include, for example, all income derived from payments awarded by the Hepatitis C and HIV Compensation Tribunal, the Residential Institutions Redress Board and payments made in relation to disability caused by Thalidomide.  In addition, ex gratia payments made to women who were admitted to and worked in the Magdalen Laundries, or through the Symphysiotomy Payment Scheme, or payments made by the Minister of Health in accordance with recommendations proposed by the Scoping Inquiry into the CervicalCheck Screening Programme are also disregarded.  All compensation or court awards which are not specifically provided for in social welfare legislation are assessed in the normal manner. However, most social assistance schemes have an initial capital disregard of €20,000. In the case of Disability Allowance and Carer's Allowance the first €50,000 of capital is disregarded.  Any changes to the means assessment of social assistance schemes would have to be considered in the overall policy and budgetary context. ",

        "answerText": " Minister for Social Protection  I propose to take Questions Nos. 169 and 170 together.  Social welfare legislation provides that means tests take account of the income and assets of the person (and their spouse or partner, if applicable) applying for the relevant scheme. The means assessment includes income from employment, self-employment, occupational pensions and maintenance payments. It also includes property owned other than the family home and capital such as savings, shares, and other investments.  Social welfare legislation provides for the disregard of certain compensation awards when assessing the means of a person.  These disregards include, for example, all income derived from payments awarded by the Hepatitis C and HIV Compensation Tribunal, the Residential Institutions Redress Board and payments made in relation to disability caused by Thalidomide.  In addition, ex gratia payments made to women who were admitted to and worked in the Magdalen Laundries, or through the Symphysiotomy Payment Scheme, or payments made by the Minister of Health in accordance with recommendations proposed by the Scoping Inquiry into the CervicalCheck Screening Programme are also disregarded.  All compensation or court awards which are not specifically provided for in social welfare legislation are assessed in the normal manner. However, most social assistance schemes have an initial capital disregard of €20,000. In the case of Disability Allowance and Carer's Allowance the first €50,000 of capital is disregarded.  Any changes to the means assessment of social assistance schemes would have to be considered in the overall policy and budgetary context. ",

        "answerText": " Deputy Verona Murphy  Will the Minister provide a breakdown of the initiatives being rolled out by the Department to reduce emissions and as a result of the carbon tax receipts, and will he make a statement on the matter? \n Deputy Eamon Ryan  The programme for Government commits that carbon tax revenues will be used to ensure carbon tax increases are progressive by spending €3 billion on targeted social welfare and other initiatives to prevent fuel poverty and ensure a just transition; to provide €5 billion to part-fund a socially progressive national retrofitting programme; and to allocate €1.5 billion to encourage and incentivise farmers to farm in a greener and more sustainable way. Between 2020 and 2023, my Department spent €482.1 million of carbon tax funds. A total of €472 million of these funds have been invested in Ireland's world-leading retrofit schemes, delivering 108,000 home energy upgrades, increasing from 17,546 in 2020 to 47,953 in 2023, and an increase in free upgrades under the warmer homes scheme, from 1,473 in 2020 to 5,898 in 2023, at an increased average cost of €25,000 per free upgrade.  A total of €8 million supported Ireland's contribution to the green climate fund to support developing countries to respond to climate change. Half a million was spent on the national just transition fund, supporting 56 locally led projects. In 2020, carbon tax funds were used to fund electric vehicle, EV, grants and EV infrastructure. Responsibility for that has since been transferred to the Department of Transport. This year, an allocation of €388 million of carbon tax funds is in place and will be spent. \n Deputy Verona Murphy  It is fair to say that with the €3 billion the Government collects, what the Minister really did was head off to COP and sign us up to targets that we could never meet. We face fines of between €3 billion and €8 billion as a result. The Minister will be long gone into the sunset when that occurs. The hardship he has caused people who have bought electric vehicles is pretty dismal. They bought them in good faith that the Minister would put the infrastructure in place, having given them a very small partial grant, and that infrastructure is not in place. Now many face the position where they cannot trade those cars because they have halved in value. The car dealers are not able to sell them and therefore cannot take them in, so we are left in a position where the Minister wrote to Ursula von der Leyen to make up for his mistake. He wrote to her on 7 October, along with some other ministers in the EU, and asked her to take advantage of the corporate fleet, those who have a car for work and get benefit-in-kind. He is asking her to look at that and, as he put it, to tap into it. The potential, however, currently remains untapped. The Minister now wants to force the EU to correct his mistake and bring in some further imposition where he lacked the capability to put the infrastructure in place to deal with the electric car market. He put the cart before the horse and now people are left footing the bill. \n Deputy Eamon Ryan  I believe we can meet our climate obligations and targets, which we need to do to protect our people from the incredible damage that will be done if we do not stop runaway climate change. The fact that last year, our emissions dropped by 6.8% shows it is possible. It is not just for environmental reasons. There are many social benefits as we make this switch to green. There are also, critically, benefits for the economy. I happened to be at the European Energy Council today and at the European Environment Council yesterday. We were discussing the Draghi report, which is the centre of the new European economic strategy. It is all about going green. I do not think there was a country there which did not think that if it does not do this, it will fall behind and its economy will not function. I disagree with the Deputy fundamentally. I believe electric vehicles have a real future and that new cars will all be electric, because they are better cars and are cheaper to run, especially when we can run them on our own renewable power rather than having to import and send money to the Middle East, Russia or elsewhere. This transition is coming. It will be good for our people. This Government has made incredible strides in that direction, as we can see with the numbers of houses being retrofitted. The number of electric vehicles on the road has taken a temporary reduction but it will come back because they are better cars and we will have the infrastructure to service them, including the renewable power. \n Deputy Verona Murphy  They are better cars. yet the Minister is putting tariffs on Chinese cars at half the price. He really does not want people to drive them, does he? The Minister did put the cart before the horse. I am not denying that the transition will take place, but the reality is the Minister has left some people in a financially disadvantaged position because of his inability to provide the infrastructure. We have allowed the Chinese to flood the market with cars that are built at half the price, might I add, from coal-powered energy. Sometimes people see the Minister going off and signing up to targets that mean little or nothing except billions in fines for this country. That is what makes them suspicious of the green agenda. Everybody has bought into the green agenda, but it seems to be costing some people more. It seems to be costing our fishing fleet and farmers more, all because the Minister has signed up to targets which are just not achievable, not in the timeframe for which the Minister signed up to them. He has decimated sectors of rural Ireland without a second thought. \n Deputy Eamon Ryan  I fear that the Deputy's words may be stoking suspicion and are not a true reflection of what is actually happening. First, we will likely meet our target for the number of electric vehicles on the road by the end of next year. I would like to see it higher and faster but we are on track. We are providing infrastructure. This summer, we agreed major investment, which is actually happening and being built, with high-speed fast charging in our motorway stations, and in our sports clubs across the country, where people will be able to go to the match or to the kids' training and charge at the same time. We are putting €100 million into exactly that infrastructure. Some 80% of Irish vehicles are charged at home, which gives us a real advantage. Distances are not so long in Ireland. All these new cars can work within the ranges we might need them to do on our island. We have one of the more advanced and better developed systems. We were one of the first, because the Green Party was in government ten years ago. We started this transition then by building out the first national network of charging systems. The Deputy could stoke suspicions by saying it is all terrible and we are the worst. We are not. I agree with the Deputy that Irish people want to make this green leap. They want to make this change. They are doing it in their homes, in how they manage transport and on our farms. It is happening, despite the suspicions the Deputy refers to. \n Deputy Verona Murphy  The reality is that, 20 years ago, the Green Party told everybody to buy diesel, that it was the energy of the future. The Green Party said that was the science. The science suddenly changed to buying electric. Now we are in a position where people bought electric but there is no infrastructure to support it. The electric cars are now coming from China at half the cost and are built with coal-fuelled energy. The Minister talks about suspicion.  There is a delusion in this country that we are going to take the cleanest diesel engines from trucks with euro 6 engines and put them on freight trains that are not even euro 1. \n Acting Chairman (Deputy Darren O'Rourke)  I am sorry Deputy, but the time for priority questions has elapsed. \n Deputy Verona Murphy  That is the point, and the Minister needs to answer it. I am not stoking suspicion, I am stating a fact. \n Deputy Eamon Ryan  We changed the tax code 15 or 20 years ago because we wanted to support lower emissions vehicles. \n Deputy Verona Murphy  What is the euro rating of the trains? \n Deputy Eamon Ryan  Thirty-five years ago we read and understood the science of climate change and the need for action. \n Deputy Verona Murphy  What is the euro rating of the trains the Minister is proposing to carry these trucks on? \n Deputy Eamon Ryan  I would like to see Deputy Murphy supporting----- \n Deputy Verona Murphy  What are the euro ratings of the trains the Minister is proposing to put the clean trucks on? Answer that. \n Deputy Eamon Ryan  What I would love to see Deputy Murphy supporting, as part of this new investment to a green economy, is the investment in Rosslare Harbour. It is at the centre of a new, cleaner way of doing things, including the reintroduction of rail freight and the restoration of the rail line from Wexford to Waterford----- \n Deputy Verona Murphy  What is the euro rating of the trains? \n Deputy Eamon Ryan  -----to revitalise both. \n Deputy Verona Murphy  The Minister does not have it. \n Deputy Eamon Ryan  That is the future. It is going green. ",

        "answerText": " Minister for Education  The new Junior Cycle SPHE specification was introduced in schools for those entering first year in September 2023.  The aim of the course is to build students’ self-awareness and positive self-worth; to develop the knowledge, understanding, skills, dispositions and values that will support them to lead fulfilling and healthy lives; empower them to create, nurture and maintain respectful and loving relationships with self and others; and enhance their capacity to contribute positively to society.  The specification consists of four strands: Understanding Myself and Others; Making Healthy Choices; Relationship and Sexuality; and Emotional Wellbeing.  Teaching and learning is age and stage appropriate, based on research and informed by the extensive consultation.  Learning outcomes over the three years of Junior Cycle range from communicating in a respectful and effective manner, to appreciating the importance of setting healthy boundaries, considering the impact of stress and techniques to manage day to day stresses, and learning outcomes dealing with alcohol, smoking and other addictive substances.  Sensitive topics such as the influence of pornography are also addressed but it is important to be clear that in this regard, key messages would be that pornography is not a good place to go to learn about sex, that it can be disturbing and even damaging for young people, and that it is incompatible with values of human dignity, respect and gender equality. No inappropriate graphic or explicit material should ever be used in a classroom setting.  The curriculum specification is published on curriculumonline.ie and I would urge all interested parties to view the full specification, including aim, rationale and learning outcomes, for themselves.  It should also be noted that, in accordance with Section 30 of the Education Act, 1998, parents have a right to have their children opt out of classes which are contrary to the conscience of the parent if they so wish.

As part of this engagement, a preferred site was identified. Following a lengthy negotiation process between WCC and the Vendor, agreement could not be reached on price. WCC have since progressed the acquisition of the site by way of compulsory purchase order (CPO).  The intention is that a proportion of this site will be used to facilitate a new Wexford Campus for SETU with the reminder of the site being developed by WCC.  The acquisition has significantly progressed with WCC having successfully moved to the final stages of the CPO process with the “Notice to Treat” being served. The issuing of this notice is a significant milestone as it obligates the Local Authority to acquire the property and obliges the owner to surrender same.  The HEA have recently received a business case from SETU outlining their proposed infrastructure requirements for the site. Once the business case is approved, it will feed into the overall masterplan currently being prepared by WCC for the subject lands.  I am aware that it has been a long-term ambition of SETU to secure a suitable permanent campus site in Wexford to facilitate higher education progression and integration in the South East, and I remain fully supportive of this ambition.

The main elements of the proposed Scheme included construction of flood defence walls, river channel widening and deepening, construction of a new road bridge over the River Slaney, and construction of a new pedestrian bridge to replace the removal of the existing Seamus Rafter Bridge. In March 2022 the Minister for Public Expenditure, NPD Delivery and Reform made a decision to refuse this Scheme under Section 7E(1)(B) of the Arterial Drainage Act.  Since March 2022 there has been extensive engagement between the OPW and Wexford County Council (WCC), who are the contracting authority for the Scheme. In Q4 2023, WCC submitted a proposed strategy for the progression of the Scheme to the OPW. The proposed strategy, which was approved by the OPW, comprises two phases for the delivery of the Scheme (i.e. Phase 1 Bridgeworks and Phase 2 Flood Relief Works).  Phase 1 of the Scheme will include the construction of the new River Slaney Bridge, the construction of a new pedestrian bridge and the removal of the Seamus Rafter Bridge, which poses an obstruction to river flow through the town centre during flood events. Phase 2 of the Scheme will include the construction of the remaining flood relief measures for Enniscorthy town.  The Project Steering Group is currently progressing design options for Phase 1 and it is envisaged that a planning application will be submitted to An Bord Pleanála (“the Board”) in Q3 2025. To facilitate a submission to the Board, the relevant environmental surveys are currently being updated and an Environmental Impact Assessment Report and a Natura Impact Statement will be prepared. Additionally, a public consultation will take place in the coming months. With regards to Phase 2 of the Scheme, WCC and the OPW are currently finalising a Project Brief in order to issue a tender for the appointment of a consultant. The Project Brief is in its final stages of development and it is expected to go to tender in Q4 2024. Once a consultant is appointed, the design options for Phase 2 will be progressed.  The OPW and WCC remain committed to the progression of this Scheme, which currently has an approved total project budget of approximately €51m, which will be funded under the Government’s €1.3bn for flood relief measures under the National Development Plan to 2030.

        "answerText": " Minister for Health  I propose to take Questions Nos. 420, 421, 424, 425 and 426 together.  GPs are private practitioners, most of whom hold a GMS contract with the HSE for the provision of GP services without charge to medical card and GP visit card holders.  Where a person who holds a medical card or GP visit card, experiences difficulty in finding a GP to accept them as a patient, that person having unsuccessfully applied to at least three GPs in the area (or fewer if there are fewer GPs in the area) can apply to the HSE National Medical Card Unit which has the power to assign a GMS patient to a GP's GMS patient list in accordance with the GMS contract.  People who do not hold a medical card or GP visit card access GP services on a private basis and can make enquiries directly to any GP practice they wish to register with. As private practitioners, it is a matter for each individual GP to decide whether to accept additional private patients. Where a GP practice has a full list of patients and cannot take on new patients, patients should contact other GP practices in the surrounding areas. The HSE website provides a \"Find a GP\" facility which can assist in finding nearby GP practices.  It is worth noting that eligibility for a GP visit card was extended last year to all those who earn up to the median household income, which has greatly increased the number of persons eligible for a GP visit card. The qualifying threshold calculation takes into consideration the applicant’s particular expenses and the number of dependents as well as their income, allowing for those who have a higher income but also experience high expenses to potentially qualify for a card.  The Government is working to increase the number of GPs practicing in the State and thereby improve access to GP services across the country.  Under the 2019 GP Agreement additional annual expenditure provided for general practice was increased by €211.6m. This provided for significant increases in capitation fees for participating GMS GPs, and new fees for additional services and increased practice supports. The GP Agreement 2023 further increased GP capitation fees, increased the existing subsidy rates for practice staff, and introduced a grant support for additional staff capacity as well a practice staff maternity leave support. These measures make general practice in Ireland a more attractive career choice for doctors.  Annual intake to the GP training scheme has been increased by approximately 80% over the last 5 years. 347 new entrants commenced training this year, a 21% increase on last year’s intake of 286. Furthermore, the recruitment of GPs from abroad is ongoing under the International Medical Graduate (IMG) Rural GP Programme. 121 GPs were enrolled under the International Medical Graduate programme last year and resources have been provided to recruit up to 250 more GPs from outside Ireland this year. The placement of GPs under the programme is targeted to rural and underserviced areas.  Lastly, a Strategic Review of General Practice is underway. The review, with input from key stakeholders, is examining the broad range of issues affecting general practice including issues related to GP capacity. When completed, the review will set out the measures necessary to deliver a more sustainable general practice into the future. ",

The table below outlines the number of open applications that are currently within the Medical Council system and the registration processing time for the various categories of application. The total “open” applications includes all first-time applications in the system which are either; awaiting assessment, are currently under assessment, or have had eligibility granted but have not yet activated registration.  Doctors are made “eligible” once a full assessment of their application has been conducted and it has been established that they meet the necessary requirements for registration. However, many doctors will not activate their registration immediately for a variety of reasons. It is important to note that these doctors remain eligible and their application remains “open” whether they decide to activate their registration or not.  The Deputy should also note that the Medical Council prioritises applications for doctors who have been offered a job with the HSE and operates a “fast-track” registration route for these applicants.

        "answerText": " Minister for Health  I propose to take Questions Nos. 420, 421, 424, 425 and 426 together.  GPs are private practitioners, most of whom hold a GMS contract with the HSE for the provision of GP services without charge to medical card and GP visit card holders.  Where a person who holds a medical card or GP visit card, experiences difficulty in finding a GP to accept them as a patient, that person having unsuccessfully applied to at least three GPs in the area (or fewer if there are fewer GPs in the area) can apply to the HSE National Medical Card Unit which has the power to assign a GMS patient to a GP's GMS patient list in accordance with the GMS contract.  People who do not hold a medical card or GP visit card access GP services on a private basis and can make enquiries directly to any GP practice they wish to register with. As private practitioners, it is a matter for each individual GP to decide whether to accept additional private patients. Where a GP practice has a full list of patients and cannot take on new patients, patients should contact other GP practices in the surrounding areas. The HSE website provides a \"Find a GP\" facility which can assist in finding nearby GP practices.  It is worth noting that eligibility for a GP visit card was extended last year to all those who earn up to the median household income, which has greatly increased the number of persons eligible for a GP visit card. The qualifying threshold calculation takes into consideration the applicant’s particular expenses and the number of dependents as well as their income, allowing for those who have a higher income but also experience high expenses to potentially qualify for a card.  The Government is working to increase the number of GPs practicing in the State and thereby improve access to GP services across the country.  Under the 2019 GP Agreement additional annual expenditure provided for general practice was increased by €211.6m. This provided for significant increases in capitation fees for participating GMS GPs, and new fees for additional services and increased practice supports. The GP Agreement 2023 further increased GP capitation fees, increased the existing subsidy rates for practice staff, and introduced a grant support for additional staff capacity as well a practice staff maternity leave support. These measures make general practice in Ireland a more attractive career choice for doctors.  Annual intake to the GP training scheme has been increased by approximately 80% over the last 5 years. 347 new entrants commenced training this year, a 21% increase on last year’s intake of 286. Furthermore, the recruitment of GPs from abroad is ongoing under the International Medical Graduate (IMG) Rural GP Programme. 121 GPs were enrolled under the International Medical Graduate programme last year and resources have been provided to recruit up to 250 more GPs from outside Ireland this year. The placement of GPs under the programme is targeted to rural and underserviced areas.  Lastly, a Strategic Review of General Practice is underway. The review, with input from key stakeholders, is examining the broad range of issues affecting general practice including issues related to GP capacity. When completed, the review will set out the measures necessary to deliver a more sustainable general practice into the future. ",

Under the Road Safety Authority Act 2006, the operation of the National Driver Testing Service is the statutory responsibility of the Road Safety Authority (RSA) and the information requested is held by that organisation. I have therefore referred the specific questions to the RSA for direct, detailed reply. I would ask the Deputy to contact my office if a response has not been received within ten days.  To address issues of rising demand and wait times for a driving test, in March 2023 the Department of Transport conveyed sanction for the RSA to recruit up to an additional 75 driver testers on a temporary basis.  More recently, in line with the conditions set out in the 2023 sanction, the RSA submitted a business case to the Department in June 2024 regarding long-term, permanent staffing needs for the service to cater to current and future demand. The Department conveyed sanction the beginning of September for 70 additional driver testing posts on a permanent basis, bringing the permanent sanction to 200. This is more than double the sanctioned headcount in June 2022, which was 100 testers. As a condition of sanction for these additional resources, my officials have requested that a plan is put in place to restore waiting times to the service level agreement of 10 weeks as soon as possible.The Deputy may wish to note that the RSA has started to publish detailed monthly information on the driver testing service on the CSO website, including the breakdown of waiting times and distribution of testing capacity by test centre as well as details on the number of testers.

To address issues of rising demand and wait times for a driving test, in March 2023 the Department of Transport conveyed sanction for the RSA to recruit up to an additional 75 driver testers on a temporary basis.  More recently, in line with the conditions set out in the 2023 sanction, the RSA submitted a business case to the Department in June 2024 regarding long-term, permanent staffing needs for the service to cater to current and future demand. The Department conveyed sanction the beginning of September for 70 additional driver testing posts on a permanent basis, bringing the permanent sanction to 200. This is more than double the sanctioned headcount in June 2022, which was 100 testers. As a condition of sanction for these additional resources, my officials have requested that a plan is put in place to restore waiting times to the service level agreement of 10 weeks as soon as possible.The Deputy may wish to note that the RSA has started to publish detailed monthly information on the driver testing service on the CSO website, including the breakdown of waiting times and distribution of testing capacity by test centre as well as details on the number of testers.

[36323/24] ",
        "answerText": " Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage  At the outset, it is important to highlight that my role in relation to local and regional planning matters is to provide the legislative, policy and financial framework at a national level within which local and regional authorities can perform their functions. Section 30 of the Planning and Development Act 2000 (as amended) provides that the Minister shall not exercise any power or control in relation to any particular case with which a planning authority of the Board is or may be concerned.  In January 2024, I issued the Sustainable Residential Development and Compact Settlements Guidelines for Planning Authorities under section 28 of the Planning and Development Act 2000. The guidelines set out national policy for planning authorities and An Bord Pleanála in relation to the planning and development of urban and rural settlements, including policy and guidance in relation to residential density. Planning authorities and An Bord Pleanála are required to have regard to the guidelines in the performance of their functions under the Act.  The guidelines state that dwellings per hectare (dph) will continue to be the primary measure for residential density. This measure is well understood and embedded within the planning system, and when applied alongside other design standards, provides a relatively simple and effective means of reflecting the quantum, scale and form of development within settlements. When calculating net densities for shared accommodation, such as student housing, the guidelines state that four bed spaces shall be the equivalent of one dwelling. It is of note that the Sustainable Urban Housing Design Standards for New Apartments Guidelines (2023) describe shared accommodation as a professionally managed rental accommodation, where individual rooms are rented and have access to shared or communal facilities and amenities. The guidelines describe a studio apartment as a unit with a combined living / sleeping area, generally provided for a single person. ",

I am advised by the Garda authorities that this has seen an increase to over fourteen thousand Garda members nationwide, representing an increase of 10% since the end of December 2015.

I am advised by the Garda authorities that 6,381 people applied.  I am informed that the first intake into the Garda College in 2024 was on 8 April and 186 Trainees commenced training on that date. The second intake into the Garda College was on 1 July with 157 Trainees commencing training. I am also informed that there are a further two intakes planned in 2024.

As Minister, I have no role in these independent functions.  I can, however, assure the Deputy that the Government is committed to building stronger, safer communities and a strengthened, well-resourced Garda Síochána is central to this policy. This commitment is demonstrated by the unprecedented provision of more than €2.35 billion to the Garda Vote this year, which is allowing for sustained and ongoing recruitment and investment in new equipment and new vehicles.  To assist with recruitment, the Government has increased the age of entry from 35 to 50, extended the retirement age to 62 and most recently increased the training allowance to €354. This represents an increase of over 92% in the last 12 months. The Government is determined that An Garda Síochána grows to 15,000 members and beyond.  To be of assistance I have contacted the Garda authorities and have been advised that, as of 13 September, the number of recruits undergoing training in the Garda College, Templemore is 434.  For the Deputy's information, two further intakes into the College are planned for this year as well as two further attestations of Probationer Gardaí. These attestations will be this month and in December. ",

In the meantime, An Garda Síochána is working closely with the OPW to develop a plan to upgrade elements of the training college on a phased basis, to provide enhanced facilities at Templemore.

We are also committed to increasing the number of Garda staff to 4,000 and the Garda Reserve to 1,000 by the end of 2026 and to 2,000 thereafter. I have provided record levels of funding to the Garda Vote, including over €2.35 billion under Budget 2024 which is an increase of over 25% since 2020. This funding is supporting ongoing recruitment of Garda members and staff.  The most recent Garda recruitment campaign, which ran in January and February this year, received a very strong response with over 6,300 people applying to become a Garda. This is a significant increase on the 5,000 people who applied last year. It is good to see that so many people want to join An Garda Síochána with a strong response from people aged between 35 and 50. Well over a third of the applications were in that age group.  To assist with recruitment, I have taken a number of actions with colleagues in Government over the past number of months including:  • Increased the training allowance for Garda recruits to €354.
