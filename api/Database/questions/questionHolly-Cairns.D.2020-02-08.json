        "answerText": " Minister for Education and Youth  The project to which the Deputy refers is devolved for delivery to the National Development Finance Agency (NDFA) as part of a programme of school building projects.  The project brief provides for the development of a New 12 Classroom Primary School with a 2 class Special Education Needs (SEN) base.  The project is currently at Stage 2b of the architectural process (post planning permission), which allows for detailed design/planning, obtaining the necessary statutory permissions and the preparation of tender documents.  The length of time a project takes to go through each stage varies and depends on a number of factors, including scale and complexity. At this early stage it is not possible to provide a timeline for completion of this project.  Since 2020, my department has invested over €6 billion in our schools throughout the country under the National Development Plan, involving the completion of over 1,300 school building projects.  In addition, repurposing and optimisation of existing accommodation capacity across the school estate has been a key enabler of timely, local provision of special class capacity in a way that supports best practice in inclusion and integration. Circa 80% of new special classes in 2025/26 are being facilitated in repurposed classroom accommodation. Government support for this investment, including by way of supplementary capital funding, has delivered real benefits for school communities. Supplementary capital funding of €210 million approved by Government has brought the total capital allocation for 2025 for my department to €1.6 billion.  In July, the Government announced a capital allocation of €7.55 billion for the Department of Education and Youth for the period 2026-2030 under the National Development Plan. As part of this NDP allocation my department will place a strong emphasis on provision for children with special educational needs, with a particular focus on meeting annual school place needs.  In relation to project rollout for Large-Scale projects and Additional School Accommodation scheme projects, the approach will be to continue to maximise the capacity of the existing school estate as much as possible in the first instance and provide necessary additional capacity through targeted and prioritised project rollout over the course of 2026 to 2030 period to meet the most urgent and prioritised needs.  Government Departments are currently in the process of publishing their sectoral NDP Implementation Plans. The sectoral plan for the Education and Youth sector will be published next week and the first tranche of projects to progress to construction will be published in January. This NDP Implementation Plan will optimise outputs from the NDP allocations, with a strong focus on maximising existing school capacity, progressing priority projects where local capacity across schools in the area is insufficient, and ensuring delivery that is affordable, offers value for money, and meets functional needs.

        "answerText": " Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade  I propose to take Questions Nos. 146 and 148 together.  I am deeply concerned by the horrific abduction of children and teachers from St Mary’s Catholic School in Niger State in Nigeria on 21 November.  The Government joins all calls for the swift and safe release of the children and staff. We condemn all abductions including others that have taken place in recent weeks in Nigeria.  Many parts of Nigeria, particularly rural and semi-urban areas, do not have a significant police presence, making the task of providing security to populations and coordinating security responses challenging. Ireland, bilaterally and as a Member State of the EU, works with the Nigerian authorities and with UN and international partners to promote peace and security in areas affected by armed groups and insecurity. I understand that all efforts are being made to locate and secure the release of the abducted students and staff of St Mary's School.  The gravity of the recent abduction at St. Mary’s School and the sharp escalation in violent attacks and mass kidnappings in Nigeria over recent weeks have been recognised by the Government of Nigeria. Following President Tinubu’s decision not to attend the G20 and African Union-European Union Summits in order to focus on a response to the security situation, a nationwide security emergency was declared in Nigeria on 26 November and President Tinubu has ordered the recruitment of additional police and army personnel. On 1 December, Nigeria’s National Security Adviser visited St. Mary’s School community and underlined the Nigerian government’s strong commitment to securing the safe return of all abducted students and staff.  Our Ambassador to Nigeria and officials at our Embassy in Abuja, in cooperation with the EU, are monitoring the situation very closely and engaging with Nigerian authorities on developments.  I have also asked our Embassy to keep in contact with the Missionary Sisters of Our Lady of Apostles, the order managing the school in the Catholic Diocese of Kontagora.  The Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade is also liaising with the Embassy of Nigeria in Ireland.  Ireland has a long history in Nigeria, not least through the work of many Irish missionaries.  St. Mary's School has close links to Irish missionaries.  Through the Irish Aid programme, Ireland  provides some €2.5 million annually for humanitarian and development projects in Nigeria, implemented by missionaries and other partners on the ground.  We will continue to prioritise the strengthening of peace and security in Nigeria and the broader region, as well as addressing persistent poverty levels. We will also continue work with all relevant partners in the country to support St Mary's School and all those affected by this terrible situation. ",

        "answerText": " Minister of State at the Department of Public Expenditure, Infrastructure, Public Service Reform and Digitalisation  I propose to take Questions Nos. 408 and 430 together.  Through the national Catchment Flood Risk Assessment and Management (CFRAM) Programme, the largest study of flood risk was completed by the Office of Public Works, (OPW), in 2018. This studied the flood risk for two thirds of the population against their risk of flooding from rivers and the sea. The Government’s Flood Risk Management Plans, an output of CFRAM, provided the evidence for a proactive approach to designing and constructing flood relief schemes for the most at-risk communities.  Under the national delivery model, Cork County Council is leading the delivery of six flood relief schemes in the first tranche including Bantry Flood Relief Scheme, with nine schemes planned in the second tranche. The OPW is funding nine staff in Cork County Council to support the delivery of its programme of schemes.  Investment of €1.3 billion through the National Development Plan has allowed the OPW, since 2018, to treble the number of flood relief schemes at design, planning, and construction to some 100 schemes, including the scheme for Bantry.  Bantry Flood Relief Scheme, is currently at Stage 1 (Scheme Development and Preliminary Design). The proposed Bantry scheme is expected to provide protection to some 200 properties against significant flood risk.  The scheme consultants have identified an emerging preferred option which, if feasible, will be presented to the public before the end of this year. A date for this event will be confirmed shortly. The submission of this major scheme to planning is currently scheduled for Q3 2027.  Cork County Council is also progressing the installation of screens as an interim measure, one of which is in the Mill River. Cork County Council is engaging with the landowner concerned.  A further screen is scheduled to be installed on the Alley River in Summer 2026.  To mitigate damage from recurring flood events, the OPW, since 2021, has approved some €335,000 to Cork County Council to strengthen its emergency response for the installation of non-return valves, purchase of pumps and large sandbags.  This also includes funding of some €143,000 for Individual Property Protection for affected properties in Bantry.  Cork County Council is continuing to explore, with consultants for the main flood relief scheme, other possible mitigation measures ahead of the scheme’s delivery.  The Mill Culvert Upgrade Project is a separate project to the Bantry Flood Relief Scheme.  Cork County Council is leading this project and has secured Part 8 planning consent. The Council is working with all the project stakeholders, including the OPW and Uisce Éireann on the overall funding proposal for the Mill Culvert Upgrade Project.  To allow the continued progression of the project the OPW recently approved funding for Cork County Council to meet the consultant costs associated with this stage of the project.  Cork County Council appointed a consultant for detailed design, contractor procurement and management in October 2025.  The consultant is undertaking a review of the deliverables for the project and a contract programme for delivery of the project will be finalised shortly.

The OPW currently operates some 450 surface water monitoring stations at rivers, lake and tidal locations nationwide. The data from the OPW Hydrometric Network is available publicly on waterlevel.ie/. The OPW does not have an emergency management role or a role in monitoring river water level gauges/sensors in realtime for the purposes of issuing flood alerts or warnings.  The Government has approved the development of a National Flood Forecasting and Warning Service (NFFWS) and as part of Stage 1 (which is completed) of the development of that service, a Flood Forecasting Centre (FFC) was established in Met Éireann. Stage 1 of the service focused on developing fluvial (river) and coastal flood forecasts and alerts at a National or Catchment level. Stage 2 of the service, which is under development, will focus on local flood forecasting and warning for communities.  The FFC is providing flood forecasts, river and coastal flood advisory services, hydrological observations and issuing daily flood guidance statements.

Local authorities are designated with the responsibility for the response to severe weather emergencies, including flooding.  It is widely acknowledged that local authorities consistently demonstrate both leadership and capacity in dealing with severe weather incidents.  All local authorities prepare and operate individual severe weather and flood plans, which guide their response to flooding and other severe weather events.  All matters in relation to the coordinated response to severe weather events locally, including flooding incidents, lie with the local authority concerned as the principal response agency, including the inter-agency response.  We understand from Cork County Council that  Bantry Fire Service mobilised to flooding in Bantry at 04.09hrs (04.11.25), following heavy rainfall and reported road flooding at the junction of Main Street and New Street. Bantry Fire Service deployed three portable pumps and the Council Road Services were also in attendance until the flooding subsided. The flooding affected a number of business premises.  The Department of Enterprise, Tourism and Employment operate an Emergency Humanitarian Flooding Scheme for business. The scheme is activated for specific flooding incidents. This scheme is targeted at small business, providing a contribution to small businesses of up to 20 employees, as well as to community, voluntary and sporting bodies, which have experienced damage as a result of flooding. A condition of eligibility for these schemes is that a business must not have been able to obtain flood insurance. We understand that the Department of Enterprise, Tourism & Employment has confirmed the premises involved in this flooding incident with Cork County Council and will activate the Humanitarian Flooding Scheme to support the business premises not covered by insurance. Once activated, the scheme is operated by the Red Cross. ",

A blood test for CA-125 can be carried out in primary care, as part of the assessment of an individual with possible signs/ symptoms of ovarian cancer. It is also used to monitor response to treatment for ovarian cancer, including follow up to look for recurrence. The National Cancer Control Programme has advised that CA-125 can be raised in other conditions, including endometriosis, pelvic inflammatory disease and pregnancy, and that it is also possible for CA-125 levels to be normal in a patient who has ovarian cancer, particularly in the earlier stages.  There are several criteria which a test should meet for consideration as a screening test. The National Cancer Control Programme has advised that CA-125 does not meet these criteria as it can be raised for reasons other than the presence of ovarian cancer.  The National Screening Advisory Committee advises the Minister and Department of Health on all new proposals for population-based screening programmes and revisions to existing programmes and outlines criteria for an effective screening test/programme here: assets.gov.ie/static/documents/criteria-for-appraising-the-viability-effectiveness-and-appropriateness-of-a-screening.pdf  As what is included in blood tests for women is a service matter, I have asked the Health Service Executive to respond to the deputy directly, as soon as possible.

Where the school is aware of potential difficulties that may arise as a consequence of a medical condition suffered by one or more pupils, it may be possible for the management authorities, working in conjunction with parents, teachers and children to put preventative measures in place to lessen the possibility of any difficulties arising or to ensure that, if a pupil suffers from an illness requiring, for example, the administration of medication, that appropriate treatment is available.  The administration of medicines in primary schools is the subject of an agreement between the Irish National Teachers Organisation and the organisation representing school management at primary level.  While this agreement specifies that no teacher can be required to administer medicine or drugs to pupils, it also sets out procedures that must be followed where a teacher or teachers agree to do so. The position is that either the parents of the child should make themselves available to administer medication as required, or where they wish the staff in the school to administer it, they should indemnify the school.  My Department cannot direct any member of the Board of Management or the teaching staff of the school to administer medical treatment to pupils, action and procedures which are normally carried out by medical professionals such as doctors and nurses.  Where a child requires adult assistance to assist in the administration of medicine and where the extent of assistance required would overly disrupt normal teaching time, SNA support may be allocated for this purpose. It is a matter for the Board of Management to ensure that SNAs are in a position to effectively meet the care needs of pupils for whom SNA support has been allocated in the school, when appointing an SNA. Where specific training is required, the Board of Management should liaise with the Health Service Executive (HSE) in order to ensure that the HSE provides guidance and training that enables the SNA to meet the care needs of the pupil in an appropriate manner. It is a matter for individual school authorities to make such arrangements locally. ",

The regulations increase access to specified prescription-only medicines in an emergency including adrenaline. This allows for the administration of adrenaline for known or suspected anaphylaxis, to be administered by trained members of the public in emergency situations, without the need for a prescription. Of note, there is provision for organisations such as schools and workplaces to store these medications for the administration by a trained person.  The Pharmaceutical Society of Ireland provide guidance on the implementation of this amendment for pharmacists and the Pre Hospital Emergency Care Council has established a course for the education and training of persons to safely and competently administer adrenaline in an emergency.  There is a responsibility to ensure that medications are stored and administered safely and appropriately. Those with a known risk of anaphylaxis should carefully follow their doctor’s guidance regarding carrying an adrenaline pen (‘EpiPen’) on person.  Community pharmacies are among the most accessible and trusted healthcare providers in Ireland. The State recognises the importance of pharmacies being prepared to administer these medicines safely and effectively. This is reflected in the Community Pharmacy Agreement 2025 which establishes an Emergency Medicine Administration Preparedness Allowance. To recognise that community pharmacists are authorised to administer emergency medicines, and that this service is provided on an ad hoc basis requiring pharmacists to be trained and ready to respond, an annual recurring allowance of €525 will be made available to community pharmacy contractors, commencing in 2026.

Forestry in Ireland operates within a legal and regulatory framework, namely, the Forest Act 2014 and the Forestry Regulations 2017 (SI No 191 of 2017). The regulation of forestry is necessary in order to protect forests, and also to ensure that forestry operations and activities are carried out in compliance with the principles of sustainable forest management. Compliance with forestry licence conditions is an important element of the forestry licencing process and is crucial to maintaining the integrity of the forestry licencing system.  The felling of trees requires a licence, as per Section 7 of the Forestry Act 2014. Felling of trees without such a licence is an offence. Tree felling licences carry an obligation to replant the area felled. Section 26 of the Forestry Act describes offences and penalties, and includes the provision for the issuing of Replanting Orders. Failure to comply with a Replanting Order is also an offence.  My Department carries out monitoring of licence holders for compliance with licence conditions. Typically, a Replanting Order is the primary method used - although prosecutions for non-compliance with the Forestry Act are also used - to ensure the replanting obligation is met in full.  The protection of hedgerows comes under different legislation to that of Forestry, namely, the Environmental Impact Assessment (Agriculture) Regulations. Field boundaries such as hedgerows, stone walls and clay banks are afforded protection under the Environmental Impact Assessment (Agriculture) Regulations (EIA) S.I. 456 of 2011 (as amended by S.I.

The European Commission adopted proposals for new regulations on Plant Reproductive Material (PRM) and New Genomic Techniques (NGT) in July 2023. Ireland supports both proposals and has contributed constructively to discussions on these proposals at Council Working Party meetings. Negotiations on both proposals continue. The NGT proposal is at trilogue stage and discussions on the PRM proposal continue at Council Working Party.  The PRM proposal aims to modernise the regulation of seeds in the EU, as some of the current seed Directives date back to 1966. The Commission’s proposal includes a derogation that exists currently to allow the use of farm saved seed and a new derogation to allow for the exchange in kind, of limited amounts of this seed and other PRM between farmers. Other derogations within the PRM proposal allow for the production and marketing of PRM by organisations and networks for the conservation of plant genetic resources and the marketing of seed to non-professional users (e.g. amateur gardeners).  New technology and innovation in plant breeding such as NGTs have significant potential to help overcome many of the challenges facing the agricultural sector and in doing so contribute to more resilient and sustainable food systems.  Consolidation within the seed sector is a reality for many years. There are many challenges in the agri food sector, and both these proposals will assist in addressing some of those challenges.  The PRM proposal seeks to balance the burden on small seed organisations and suppliers while protecting end users. Furthermore, the proposal recognises the role that farmers play in food systems.

Significant progress has been made in relation to the operational recommendations.  All maternity hospitals in Ireland are providing termination services in accordance with the legislation. There has also been a sustained increase in Community providers which now stands at 468.  Furthermore, the revised model of care introduced in response to the Covid pandemic was approved as the enduring model of care. Under this blended approach, it is possible for one of the two consultations required for termination in early pregnancy to take place remotely. This alleviates the time and expense involved in travelling to the doctor’s surgery twice.  Safe Access Zones legislation came into effect on Thursday, 17 October 2024, under the Health (Termination of Pregnancy Services) (Safe Access Zones) Act 2024.

        "answerText": " Minister for Health  A review of the operation of the Health(Regulation of Termination of Pregnancy) Act 2018 was completed in 2023. The final report of the review made a range of recommendations, most of which are operational in nature and are focused on increasing access to services. Significant progress has been made, in this regard. Termination services in early pregnancy (up to 12 weeks) are currently provided in all maternity hospitals.  There has also been a sustained increase in community providers, which currently stands at 468.  Furthermore, the revised model of care introduced in response to the Covid pandemic was approved as the enduring model of care. Under this blended approach, it is possible for one of the two consultations required for termination in early pregnancy to take place remotely. This alleviates the time and expense involved in travelling to the doctor’s surgery twice.  Safe Access Zones legislation came into effect on Thursday, 17 October 2024, under the Health (Termination of Pregnancy Services) (Safe Access Zones) Act 2024.  My department will continue to work with HSE, to ensure that there is safe and equitable access to termination of pregnancy, for those who need it. ",

I am keenly aware of the case raised by the deputies, and I am cognisant of the challenges the family faces, particularly considering the exceptionally difficult situation on the ground.  Since the beginning of the crisis in Gaza, the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade has supported and facilitated the travel of more than 200 people from Gaza to Ireland. This figure includes both Irish citizens and their immediate dependents.  However, facilitating an exit from Gaza is not straightforward. It is dependent on multiple factors, including, but not limited to, receipt of permissions from the relevant authorities. Much of this rests outside the control of the Government of Ireland.  My Department continues to explore options to assist individuals in Gaza who fulfil certain criteria, but is limited in the assistance if can provide to non-Irish citizens. Unfortunately travel cannot be guaranteed.  In this particular case, officers from my Department have been in regular contact with the family to provide advice and assistance. I can confirm that my Department has secured relevant documentation for the entire family, including visa approvals and permission from the relevant authorities, to exit Gaza.  Unfortunately, one member of the family requires a new travel document to permit exit and onward travel. Issuance of travel documents to non-EU nationals is entirely outside the control of my Department. Consular officers have advised that this individual should engage with the relevant authorities to request issuance of a new travel document.  My Department has also advised the family that those that can travel should do so as soon as possible. Indeed, four out of five members of the family were offered the opportunity to leave Gaza during recent evacuation operations, but they made the decision to remain until the entire family are in a position to leave.  I understand the very difficult decision the family faces. I can assure you that our officials will maintain contact with the family and assist within the limits outlined above. ",

Whitefish Quotas are generally managed on a monthly basis, with catch limits being set monthly.  At the QMAC meeting on 14th May 2025, given the high projected catch for May for the Sole stock in Area 7 f, g (Celtic Sea Sole), my Department contacted the Sea Fisheries Protection Authority (SFPA) to establish the uptake for the stock.  The SFPA advised on 14th May 2025 the total uptake for Sole in Area 7 f and g was 36.99t, therefore the quota of 36t for 2025 was exceeded.  My Department therefore requested, as a matter of urgency, that Industry Representatives engage with counterparts in other Member States to secure quota swaps to allow the fishery to remain open. As swaps could not be secured, it was necessary to close the fishery.  At the QMAC meeting on 20th August 2025, the SFPA indicated that by the end of August the projected uptake for Sole in Area 7 h, j, k (Southwest of Ireland Sole) would exceed the 2025 quota of 78t. The QMAC recommended I close the fishery with effect from 1st September.  My Department continues to work with Industry Representatives to secure quota swaps to address the landings in excess of available quota.  Celtic Sea Sole and Southwest of Ireland Sole would not be among the main stocks targeted by the Inshore sector, but small amounts may be caught as a by-catch. A range of supports are provided to inshore fishers under Ireland’s Seafood Development Programme. The attached document details supports available to the Inshore sector and the sector overall.  A range of supports are provided to inshore fishers under Ireland’s Seafood Development Programme. This programme is co-funded by the Irish government and EU Commission, providing €258M in supports to the Irish commercial seafood sector over the period 2021-2027.  Under the programme training, technical and advisory supports from Bord Iascaigh Mhara (BIM) are in place for inshore fishers. In the past year my Department has significantly improved the funding available inshore fishers, with specific schemes put in place for this sector. These include the Small-scale Coastal Fisheries Scheme which provides unprecedented enhanced grant rates of up to 80% to inshore fishers for both on-board and on-shore investment; grant rates of 100% are now in place for inshore fishers participating in the Lobster V-notching scheme and an innovative scheme to support the economic development of the inshore fishing fleet was put in place in 2024 - the Inshore Fleet Economic Assessment Scheme. All of these schemes are administered by Bord Iascaigh Mhara (BIM) on behalf of the Department, and further details can be found on BIM - Fisheries.  Other schemes available to Irish Fishers include the following:  The Sustainable Fisheries Scheme provides support to all registered fishing vessels (other than the small scale coastal fishing vessels) for on-board investment. Both the Inshore Fisheries Scheme and the Sustainable Fisheries Scheme support investment by fishing vessels in more selective gear that reduces catches of juvenile and/or over quota species, with the ultimate aim of improving the sustainability of fisheries.  The Seafood Training Scheme supports the development of skills and knowledge across the Fisheries, Aquaculture and Seafood Processing sectors  The Young Fishers Scheme provides support to persons under 40, who have 5 years+ experience and/or relevant training, to assist them in purchasing their first vessel. Grant aid up to 40% of the cost of the vessel can be accessed under this scheme, subject to a maximum payment of €250,000. There are some restrictions regarding the age and length of vessels which may be purchased under this scheme. ",

        "answerText": " Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine  In Ireland, quotas are a public resource and are managed to ensure that property rights are not granted to individual operators. The result of this long standing policy is that the Irish fishing fleet involves a balanced spread of sizes and types of fishing vessels, which have retained a strong economic link with our coastal communities and have delivered economic activity including vital employment in these communities, where there are very limited alternative economic activities.  Ireland's fish quota management system is designed to ensure the best possible spread, both between fishing vessel operators and in terms of take up of quota throughout the year, having regard to fishing patterns and market conditions.  Quotas are generally managed on a monthly basis, with catch limits being set for each month. Consultation is carried out each month at the Quota Management Advisory Committee (QMAC) meeting involving fishing industry representatives from the catching and processing sectors, the Department and the Sea Fisheries Protection Authority, which provides up-to-date catch data for stocks. The  Committee makes recommendations to me on regimes for particular stocks and, where appropriate, I follow these recommendations subject to the proper management and rational exploitation of our fisheries.  In regards to the allocation of quota by vessel size; for Whitefish (Demersal) quotas, monthly catch limits are set for vessels over and under 55 feet in length.  Pelagic stocks (such as Mackerel, Blue Whiting, Herring etc.) are managed in line with the policies for those fisheries, which specify how the quota is allocated to the various sectors of the fleet operating in the individual fisheries. These sectors are often defined by the types of gear used. For example, in the Mackerel Hook & Line Fishery, there is a specific allocation for vessels fishing by means of hooks and lines. The specific allocation for each fishery is provided in the monthly Fishery Management Notices, which are available on my Department's website at the following link: Fisheries Management Notices 2025  The attached document provides a breakdown of Ireland's quota for 2025 by species, as set out in the annual Total Allowable Catch (TAC) and Quota Regulation.  The figures in the table do not include quota carried over from 2024 or quota swapped to or from other Member States or the UK.

        "answerText": " Minister for Children, Disability and Equality  In the interest of clarity, transparency and consistent reporting, a service that left Core Funding is defined as any service that had a gap between contracts for Core Funding of 4 or more weeks. There are a number of reasons that a service might fall into this definition, for example a service could have withdrawn from the scheme, been removed from the scheme for breach or rules, or experienced a delay in re-contracting following a change of circumstance application or between programme years. Many services have left and later re-joined the scheme. There may be a small number of services who left the scheme and subsequently closed at a later date and are not captured in the figures below.  A breakdown of services engagement with Core Funding as of 5 August 2025 is below. On this date there were 4,807 services listed as being open on the Early Years Platform.      Engagement with Core Funding      Number of open services      Proportion of open services       Continued participation since first joining the scheme    4,056    84%      Previously left Core Funding but currently participating    336    7%      Left Core Funding and no longer participating    141    3%      Never participated in Core Funding    274    6%       I am aware that between 5 and 31 August 2025, two additional services reached the end of their notice period and withdrew from Core Funding.  The fourth year of Core Funding began on 1 September 2025 and uptake continues to remain on par with the same point in previous years. Every year there are a number of services who sign up to Core Funding in the weeks following the commencement of the programme year. For this reason, it is not yet possible to make an accurate assessment regarding whether further services have made the decision to no longer participate in Core Funding.  The National Childcare Scheme (NCS) is available to families using either partner or non-partner services as a way of reducing their early learning and childcare costs. A minimum of €2.14 per hour, for a maximum of 45 weekly hours is available to families with children aged between 24 weeks and 15 years of age. Higher rates may be available through an Income Assessed award, depending on a family’s individual circumstances.  A valid NCS award can be used with any early learning and childcare provider who has contracted to deliver the Scheme. Families can engage with their local City/County Childcare Committee (CCC) for assistance in sourcing alternative childcare places, if necessary. Details of local CCCs can be found here. Alternatively, a Childcare Search function is available on www.ncs.gov.ie which details a full list of the services offering the NCS and/or other programmes such as ECCE or whether they are contracted to Core Funding (i.e. Partner Services).

As part of this group my Department is currently leading on Action 6 of the Night Time Economy Strategy to “examine the practical implications for planning and other legislative codes to enable the potential for vacant buildings to be used for meanwhile use”, with the aim of providing more accessibility for NTE activity in vacant spaces.  To progress this action, my Department has undertaken a range of consultations with key stakeholders to examine the issues, including potential changes to planning and other legislation, associated with ‘meanwhile use’, which refers to the temporary use of vacant premises, for example, while awaiting a longer term development or commercial tenancy. This included a planning workshop co-hosted with DCCS, sector representative groups, local government and Government Departments.  The output of this work is feeding into the wider current review of the Planning and Development – Exempted Development Regulations which is currently underway in support of a phased implementation of the Planning and Development Act 2024. A public consultation on the Exempted Development Regulations was launched on the 29 July 2025 and any member of the public can make a submission for a period of four weeks until 26 August 2025.

        "answerText": " Minister for Education and Youth  Each year my Department advises schools of the list of prescribed texts for Leaving Certificate English for students entering fifth year. Requirements are different for students studying Higher level and Ordinary level. School authorities and teachers are asked to note that no specific text is compulsory, although at Higher level one of the listed Shakespeare plays must be studied. Dramas for study as a text on their own by 2026 Leaving Certificate students include Macbeth by William Shakespeare, Sive by John B Keane and The Crucible by Arthur Miller. In addition, a further six plays may be studied as comparative texts including Medea by Euripides, Girl on an Altar by Marina Carr, A Raisin in the Sun by Lorraine Hansberry, Once before I go by Phillip McMahon, Colder than Here by Laura Wade, and The Merry Wives of Windsor by William Shakespeare. There is no funding stream in my Department to support specific theatres or theatre companies in staging performance of any of these or other dramas.  However, the Deputy may wish to note that Leaving Certificate Drama, Film and Theatre Studies is being introduced on a phased basis in a number of selected schools from the start of the 2025/26 school year. The introduction of this new subject is being supported by a comprehensive package of supports. These supports include the establishment of a single supplier framework to directly provide Phase One schools in the free education scheme offering Drama, Film, and Theatre Studies with technical resources such as cameras, lenses, tripods, audio equipment, lighting, and staging. All Phase One schools in the free education scheme will be provided with an annual Implementation Support grant of €50 per student to support engagement with the new subject in the 2025/26 school year.  In relation to access for students to screened performances, a further support being offered to schools is an online streaming media service. This service is being provided to allow Phase One schools access to prescribed material from August 2025 and includes access to prescribed screened theatrical performances.  My Department also continues to have an active role in the delivery of a number of actions under the cross-departmental Creative Youth Plan 2023-2027 which aims to provide access and opportunities for children and young people to arts, culture, creativity and education in all of its different forms.

The application and supporting documentation was received in the Lusaka Office on 14 May 2025. The application was received in the Dublin Visa Office on the 05 June 2025 where it awaits examination and processing.  My Departments business target for join family visa applications is 12 months. It must be made clear that these are business targets for the immigration service. The business target reflects the detailed and often complex assessment that is required to be carried out in relation to applications for family reunification.  While I acknowledge the personal difficulties an applicant might be experiencing, it is not possible to give a definitive date as to when this application will be finalised. All applications are processed in chronological order, based on date order of receipt.  While every effort is made to process applications as soon as possible, processing times will vary having regard to the volume and complexity of applications, the possible need for the Immigration Service Delivery function of my Department to investigate, inquire into, or seek further information, and the resources available.  The current processing times for Dublin visa decisions is available here: https://www.irishimmigration.ie/visa-decisions/  The date published on the website is the oldest date of application currently being processed under a given category. However, it should be noted that the Visa team continue to process and make decisions on applications received after the published processing date. If a particular application takes longer to consider this may result in the published processing date remaining unchanged. I can assure you that this does not indicate the processing of these applications has halted overall.  My Department is committed to providing the best possible service to applicants. To provide greater clarity, officials in my Department are currently in the process of updating the Immigration Service website for processing times for decisions on visa applications by the Dublin visa office.  I am acutely aware that join family applications are very important for the persons impacted. I understand that people are eager to have their families join them in Ireland and I am committed to improving the service my Department provides.  The person concerned can now directly check the status of their immigration application on the Immigration Service’s new Customer Service Portal. They can register for, or log in to their existing account, at: https://portal.irishimmigration.ie/en/  As an Oireachtas member, you can also request the status of individual immigration cases by e-mail, using the Oireachtas Mail facility at: IMoireachtasmail@justice.ie, which has been specifically established for this purpose.

Services for all international protection applicants, including healthcare and education are mainstreamed and accessed through the same referral pathways as Irish residents or citizens.  Residents in International Protection Accommodation Service (IPAS) centres access GP services within the local community, and other health services are accessed through GP referral, primary care, and emergency services.  People who apply for international protection are entitled to a vulnerability assessment, in line with the requirements of the European Communities (Reception Conditions) Regulations. This is a voluntary process, and applicants are not required to share information with IPAS.  At the moment, vulnerability assessments are provided to families on arrival and vulnerability triage is provided to all single males on arrival to identify people with specific needs.  Where an applicant states that they or their child has a medical need or disability during the assessment, the person will be referred to the relevant services. The information shared by applicants is also used by IPAS to appropriately accommodate people.  Where appropriate, the applicant may also be provided with information on how to make a self-referral or directly access the relevant service. Transport to medical appointments and services is provided for residents if needed.  Most people seeking international protection are entitled to a medical card and their treatment is provided in the same manner as Irish residents or citizens, through publicly funded health and social care services provided by the HSE or by organisations funded by the HSE.  If a vulnerability or disability emerges or is advised to IPAS after a person or family has already been accommodated and they require accessible or more suitable accommodation in a particular location on medical grounds, they are asked to submit a referral form in accordance with the IPAS Protocol for Medical Transfer (https://assets.gov.ie/static/documents/ipas-protocol-for-medical-transfer-request-update.pdf).  The referral enables the person’s medical professionals to outline the accommodation requirements including mobility, proximity to hospital or other service which are then used by IPAS to identify the most suitable accommodation available within its portfolio.

        "answerText": " Minister for Children, Disability and Equality  The Directives on Standards for Equality Bodies set minimum requirements for the effective and  independent operation of Equality Bodies in a number of key areas, in order to allow them to carry out their work more effectively in all Member States and to ensure a more uniform application of EU equal treatment law.  The Directives provide that the Commission shall, by means of an implementing act, establish a list of common indicators on the functioning of equality bodies. Ireland recently took part in a pilot project aiming to help refine this indicator set.  My officials have participated in expert group meetings and workshops on transposition of these Directives with the European Commission, and are meeting regularly with relevant bodies and departments. Work is ongoing on the preparation of draft Heads. ",
