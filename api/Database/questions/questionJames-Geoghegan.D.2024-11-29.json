        "answerText": " Tánaiste and Minister for Finance  The Deputy has asked for further information in relation to the estimated cost of removing deemed disposal.  As was set out in the response to Parliamentary Question 270 of 27 November 2025, the cost of deemed disposal not applying in a given year had an estimated cost of €142 million based on data for the previous eight years. It is important to note that the information available to Revenue does not allow them to isolate the tax returned due to deemed disposal rules from other events which give rise to a tax liability. The response also noted that the actual cost could vary where the proportion of tax which is deemed disposal is higher or lower, as well as where the gains in a particular year are larger or smaller than the eight-year average used for this estimate.  This estimated cost of removing deemed disposal in a given year was calculated using a revenue foregone model, considering the reduction in the current tax yield for taxation of investments and life assurance policies. This is one of the approaches to costing identified as appropriate in the Department of Finance Guidelines on the Cost of Tax Expenditures.  As the Deputy notes, there is a significant sum currently invested in deposit accounts. There is certainly potential for savings in deposit accounts to move to more active investments. However, any gains arising from a move from savings to investments are likely to take place over the longer term, and would be unlike to impact immediately, in contrast with the immediate impact of a reduction in taxation paid where deemed disposal did not apply.  As part of their work on savings and investment accounts the European Commission considered the potential impact of introducing savings and investment accounts, improving financial literacy among the population, and fostering a broader ‘equity culture’ to increase the retail participation of EU households in EU capital markets. They also considered the potential fiscal impacts of SIAs on Member States at the EU level, while noting that there are a lot of variables that could affect the analysis for different Member States. The analysis suggests that these changes would have a positive impact. The staff working document published with the Commission's Recommendation on Savings and Investment Accounts sets out the analysis undertaken and is available at: eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX:52025SC6800  While the impact of such changes was not included in the calculation of the estimated cost associated with the removal of deemed disposal of €142 million, they are being considered in the context of the work underway on the roadmap for the taxation of retail investments, which I intend to publish in early 2026.

The decision by Government to legislate follows engagement with key stakeholders and reflects the Government’s determination to put these protections on a statutory footing and to provide legal certainty and ensure uniformity across all market participants.  My officials are currently working with the Office of the Parliamentary Council on the draft amendments to ensure the proper functioning of the disregard system once it is placed on a legislative footing. The drafting process is being undertaken with careful consideration of the implications for prudential regulation, the classification of insurance risks, establishing a process that is legally functional, and proper interaction with other financial legislation. This care is being taken to ensure that the objectives of the Bill are achieved without any unintended impacts, and that the ability to obtain mortgage protection insurance moves smoothly from a voluntary code to a legislative framework.  It is my expectation that the Bill will move to Committee Stage early in the new year, where the revised and finalised text may be considered and debated in full. Advancing the Bill represents an important step in ensuring fairer and more compassionate access to mortgage protection insurance for cancer survivors. I look forward to the engagement with colleagues across the Oireachtas on this important piece of legislation so as to ensure its timely passage into law during the early part of 2026. ",

The relevant sections of the Act were commenced on 15 February 2024 and it has been open to all local authorities since that date to put the required procedures in place to allow for the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) compliant use of CCTV to combat illegal dumping.  In order to address data protection concerns, the Act sets a number of conditions to be complied with prior to the use of CCTV by local authorities. In particular, local authorities are required to adhere to Codes of Practice which set standards for the operation of CCTV schemes. These Codes of Practice can be found on the gov.ie website.  In addition, in proposing to install CCTV schemes, local authorities are required to prepare a site management plan in respect of each scheme, setting out arrangements for monitoring, recording, preserving and disclosing the images produced. Data Protection Impact Assessments must also be carried out in accordance with section 84 of the Data Protection Act 2018. The CEO of the local authority is also required to sign off that they are satisfied that the scheme is proportionate to the enforcement needs identified at the site, meets relevant data protection requirements, and can only be accessed by persons of good character in direct employment with the local authority or, where relevant, An Garda Síochána.  It is an operational matter for each individual local authority to determine the most appropriate enforcement response to incidents of illegal dumping, including the use of CCTV. As such, the Department does not collate data on data processing agreements entered into by individual local authorities when installing CCTV schemes in their respective functional areas. ",

        "answerText": " Minister of State at the Department of Public Expenditure, Infrastructure, Public Service Reform and Digitalisation  Circular 1 of 2025 was published by the Department of Public Expenditure Infrastructure Public Service Reform and Digitalisation (DPER) on the 2nd January 2025. This Circular outlines the arrangements and responsibilities for the management and maintenance of State accommodation in Government Departments and Offices. The circular is available online at: assets.gov.ie/static/documents/dpendr-circular-012025-management-and-maintenance-of-accommodation-in-government-depar.pdf  This Circular replaces DPER Circular 1 of 2013 and applies to all accommodation where the Office of Public Works is the legal owner, tenant, lessee or licensee. This Circular takes account of a growing Civil and Public Service with increased demands, and also takes into account the changing economic and political environments, including new policies on blended working.  As described under this Circular, the OPW is responsible for acquiring accommodation and managing space allocation based on accommodation briefs from clients. The OPW clients are responsible for the ongoing day-to-day management and efficient use of their space allocation and will advise the OPW if their space allocation is underutilised including proactively engaging with the OPW on the reallocation of space for alternative purposes.  As part of this new Circular, OPW clients are obliged to submit an annual return to the OPW with occupant numbers, workstation numbers, methodology of information capture, staff attendance numbers, utilisation, and functions within their allocated space. The returns in respect of 2025 are due by the end of January 2026 and the OPW will assess the responses in terms of data maturity and consistency. Subject to the refinement of the process, and consultation with the OPW client base, the OPW will seek to publish information in 2027, or as soon as meaningful and comparable information is available in a consistent manner, in accordance with the C & AG report. This will be done in consultation with the Civil Service Management Board.  Between 2015 and 2024, the number of full time equivalent (FTE) civil servants employed in Ireland increased by 45%. The total area of office accommodation managed, as reported by the OPW, decreased by 1% in the same period. The office space per civil servant has decreased significantly from a level of 24.2 square meters in 2015 to 16.4 square meters in 2024.  During 2023, and building on a series of pre-covid surveys, the OPW began a new programme occupancy surveys to identify how space is being used by clients since the widespread adoption of blended working. Over 200,000 square metres was surveyed nationally, which represents approximately one quarter of the office accommodation portfolio. The observed occupancy in these buildings varied significantly with some buildings operating in excess of 65% utilisation when visited by the team.  The OPW will continue to work with its clients to assess and validate information that is available through the occupier return forms, and will identify additional opportunities for consolidation and optimum usage across the portfolio while ensuring the operational requirements of government can be accommodated.

The first meeting of the Steering Group took place in November 2024. There have been 11 Steering Group meetings since its inception. The next meeting of the Steering Group is planned for January 2026.  The cost range estimate was based on an assessment of accommodating, in outline form, the commitments made by Government. It is anticipated that, subject to the outcomes of a non-statutory public consultation and engagement process, the future GPO Complex will incorporate at least some, or all of the following:  1. Retention of a public post office function  2. A significant cultural use/ uses  3. Public realm enhancements at street level to encourage public use of the GPO complex.  4. High-quality offices on the upper floors to provide critical accommodation to meet ongoing/ additional Government requirements.  5. Reimagined retail components within the existing retail footprint, along Henry Street and in the GPO Arcade.  Technical Consultants will be procured publicly, and they will contracted to provide services to the Office of Public Works.  There are several work streams in operation at present, which include property related matters, the non-statutory public consultation engagement process and meanwhile uses. It is expected that other work streams will be required to support the Steering Group in time.  The Office of Public Works has developed a framework for a non-statutory public consultation and engagement process which aligns with the requirements of the Infrastructure Guidelines and other key statutory consents. A detailed request for tender to provide non-statutory public consultation and engagement services has been drafted. It is anticipated that the successful tenderer will provide services which are structured in the following manner and/ or under the following themes; Educate, Listen, Debate, Define, Describe and Select.  The membership of the GPO Complex Steering Group is as follows:  Assistant Secretary General (Head of Estate Management), Office of Public Works – Steering Group co-chair.  State Architect and Principal Architect, Office of Public Works – Steering Group co-chair.  Higher Executive Officer, Property Management Owned (OPW) – Steering Group secretary.

        "answerText": " Minister for Enterprise, Tourism and Employment  I regularly engage with the enterprise sector and with the agencies under the remit of this department in relation to artificial intelligence (AI) and the labour market. In respect of graduate employment and entry level jobs and the impact of AI, I am not aware of any specific evidence. Instead, I would take a broader look at the labour market and highlight how well our economy is performing despite difficult external conditions.  If you look to the latest CSO Labour Force Survey (LFS), this showed that there were a record number of people at work in our economy, with total employment at 2.8 million. Furthermore, our economy is continuing to add and create jobs with total numbers at work were up 30,700 persons in the year to Q3. Ireland has record low rates of unemployment and record high rates of activity.  There is no doubt that AI will revolutionise many aspects of the labour market and how we go about our day-to-day work. Research from both this Department and the Department of Finance (see: Artificial Intelligence: Friend or Foe - www.gov.ie/en/department-of-finance/publications/artificial-intelligence-friend-or-foe/), pointed to the fact that the Irish labour market is more exposed to AI than many of our peer economies. This points to risks and opportunities. The same work also highlighted that younger workers (those aged 15-24 years) appear to be slightly more exposed to AI, relative to older workers. This reflects factors such as educational attainment (younger workers here tend to be more qualified).  While the pace of job creation within Ireland has slowed in recent months, much of this was anticipated, reflecting global headwinds and capacity constraints. I also note that the Department of Finance and the Central Bank Ireland both expect that unemployment will remain below 5% on average in 2026 and 2027.  We are continuing to monitor the labour market and AI very closely. My department, through the Expert Group on Future Skills Needs (EGFSN) published a very interesting paper on this very theme last October. The paper ‘How AI is transforming the Irish Labour Market’ (see: egfsn-skills-insight-note-2025-2-_how-ai-is-transforming-the-irish-labour-market-final-for-website.pdf - www.egfsn.ie/media/2y5derks/egfsn-skills-insight-note-2025-2-_how-ai-is-transforming-the-irish-labour-market-final-for-website.pdf) highlights the speed at which Ireland is moving in relation to AI. The research noted that Ireland leads in terms of the demand for AI jobs but also has a strong performance in relation to the supply of AI talent.  We have seen a doubling in AI jobs and usage since 2023. While this is a fast-changing field – it shows the inherent dynamism and resilience of the Irish labour market and this bodes well for productivity, growth and incomes. The paper used national level data to compare Ireland with other European and international economies but doesn’t go specifically into graduate or entry level jobs.  I will be keeping a very close eye on the impact of AI over the coming months and I would point to several projects underway within my Department that will shed on this key area. The EGFSN is funding or co-funding a number of very important pieces of AI related work, including a project on ‘Skills for Digital Specialists 2030’. I expect that this will be published in early 2026. This report will identify skills needs and skills gaps for ICT/digital specialists, including AI.  The EGFSN is also co-funding a new ‘ Working in Ireland Survey’ on the Irish labour market being done by UCD. Research from this extensive, all-island study will be available in 2026 and will include work on AI and the labour market. My Department also has a working relationship with the OECD on AI related research and I expect this will continue next year. ",

IDA Ireland’s 2025-29 strategy, Adapt Intelligently, published earlier this year, places a focus on partnering with the existing FDI base to retain and renew their Irish operations, alongside an emphasis on identifying new opportunities. The strategy was developed against a backdrop of developments that are reshaping the global FDI landscape including deglobalisation, digitalisation, and decarbonisation/sustainability and in the context of national policies, including the Programme for Government, Project Ireland 2040, and the Government’s White Paper on Enterprise.  The IDA strategy recognises AI and Digital as a key FDI growth driver that will cut across the core sectors of Technology; Content, Consumer and Business Services; International Financial Services; Pharmaceuticals; Medical Technologies and Engineering and the Green Economy. The targets set out in the strategy are based on extensive analysis and scenario planning related to the national, international, and sector-specific landscape. This included engagement with client companies, IDA teams in Ireland and overseas, my and other Government Departments, national and regional stakeholders, and external economic and FDI experts. Based on this analysis, IDA’s strategic objectives to 2029 are to:  • strengthen long-term investment;  • scale-cutting edge innovation;  • drive sustainable change; and  • maximise regional opportunities.  The strategy targets 1,000 investments to include:  • securing €7bn in new RD&I investment;  • delivering 550 regional investments from a TOTAL OF 1,000;  • reducing IDA client carbon emissions by 35%;  • creating 75,000 jobs and  • upskilling 40,000 people.  Across these growth drivers and within these sectors, IDA is targeting investment with AI-related activity including smart, sustainable manufacturing; intelligent, digitalised services; RD&I; high growth emerging companies; and future skills. Over the 2021 to 2024 period, AI had already become an increasing area of focus within investments won by IDA. This includes \"new name\" investment by emerging AI firms, in addition to AI related RD&I and talent development investment by IDA’s existing clients.

As of September, 67% of Enterprise Ireland’s High Potential Start-up intake for 2025 was in innovative digital sectors.

By facilitating access to resources, expertise, and funding, Enterprise Ireland ensures that Irish companies are well-equipped to embrace AI and digital innovation and thrive in the digital age.  Irish enterprises across all technology sectors, including digital, IT services, life sciences, food technology, fintech and financial services, have embraced AI as an opportunity to deliver enhanced and more sophisticated products and services.

Artificial Intelligence (AI) spans a range of business areas and has no specific NACE code. Therefore, providing insights on employment created in AI related companies requires alternate approaches.  By way of example, data from the company Indeed shows the share of job postings on its website that contain Artificial Intelligence (AI) terms. 11.2% of job posting contained AI terms in November 2025 and this was up from 5.6% in November 2021. The data can be further explored at this link: data.indeed.com/#/ai  Government’s ambition is that Ireland’s future growth will be built on innovation. We want to drive digital and AI innovation across the spectrum of enterprise.  Enterprise Ireland’s Strategy 2025-2029 Delivering for Ireland, Leading Globally includes several strategic initiatives to boost SME digital and AI adoption including to:  • Provide strategic company development and training grants to help Irish businesses to embrace the twin transition of sustainability and digitalisation.  • Partner with the European Digital Innovation Hubs to support Irish businesses to map their digital journeys and identify appropriate technologies to drive growth  As of September, 67% of Enterprise Ireland’s HPSU (High Potential Start-up) intake for 2025 was in innovative digital sectors.  IDA Ireland identified digitalisation and AI as one of the four key growth areas for foreign investment in Ireland over the next five years.  A 2025 report by Trinity Business School estimated that AI adoption could enhance Ireland's GDP by more than €250 billion by 2035. To crystallise this will require widespread adoption of digital and AI technologies across the enterprise base to increase productivity and competitiveness.  Government will drive this adoption, working through its enterprise agencies, with a dual approach strategy that supports both foundational digital adoption for traditional SMEs and advanced AI enablement for technology native firms.

The core principle of Cost Rental is that the rents cover the development, management, and maintenance costs of the homes, so that the long-term future of the homes is financially secure, and that rents are not subject to the demand pressures of the open market.  The primary eligibility condition for accessing Cost Rental housing is a maximum net annual household income (less income tax, PRSI, USC, and employee pension contributions), which is currently set at €66,000 for homes in Dublin and €59,000 elsewhere.  The 2025 Programme for Government includes a commitment to \"keep the income criteria for cost rental under review\". In line with this commitment, the parameters for Cost Rental eligibility are kept under review by my Department, in order to ensure the scheme effectively targets the intended tenant cohort. ",

        "answerText": " Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage  Cost Rental is a key element of the Government's strategy to improve affordability in the rental sector and to provide secure, long-term homes for moderate-income households. The core principle of Cost Rental is that the rents cover the development, management, and maintenance costs of the homes, so that the long-term future of the homes is financially secure, but that rents are not subject to the pressures of the open market.  It is not intended for Cost Rental to overlap with or replace existing social housing supports for low-income households, which remain a parallel priority for the Government. Rather, Cost Rental is an additional scheme designed to assist middle-income households who do not qualify for social housing supports such as the Housing Assistance Payment (HAP), but who may be facing significant affordability pressures in the private rental market.  It is also important for prospective Cost Rental tenants to demonstrate to landlords that they will be able to sustain payment of the cost-covering rent from their own resources, whereas recipients of HAP and RAS have a demonstrated, long-term need for social housing support that is already met with State subsidies. Therefore, Cost Rental landlords do not consider for tenancies those applicants who are already in receipt of social housing supports, including HAP and RAS.  In recognition of the potential changes in household circumstances that may occur over the lifetime of a Cost Rental tenancy, however, the Affordable Housing Act 2021 allows that HAP may be provided to tenants, where they are assessed as eligible for social housing supports, after the Cost Rental tenancy has lasted for more than six months.

The National Transport Authority (NTA) has statutory responsibility for securing the provision of public passenger transport services nationally and for the scheduling and timetabling of these services in conjunction with the relevant transport operators.  BusConnects is a transformative programme of investment in the bus system, providing better bus services across our cities. It is the largest investment in the bus system in the history of the state and is managed by the NTA. The aim of the network is to improve the existing Transport for Ireland system through enhanced services with high frequency spines and new local, Orbital and Radial routes.  It is acknowledged that reliability has been a key concern during the initial rollout of Phase 7, with challenges primarily linked to traffic congestion on new city-centre alignments and driver availability. When implementing new phases of the BusConnects network, the NTA continuously monitors services, identifies any issues that arise, and puts in fixes where appropriate. My Department will continue to work with the NTA to ensure the redesigned network delivers on its objectives and its performance is closely monitored.  In light of the NTA’s responsibility in this area, I have also forwarded the Deputy's question to the NTA for direct reply.

In the cases of all consortia-led apprenticeship programmes, a consortium that is chaired by industry meets regularly to review the content and structure of programmes and ensure alignment with industry needs.An annual grant of €2,000 per apprentice was introduced for employers of apprentices completing consortia-led programmes.  Additionally, the Traveller Apprenticeship Incentivisation Programme (TAIP) offers bursaries to both apprentices and their employers. Employers who employ apprentices who are travellers can avail of a grant of €2,000.Investing in Ireland's apprenticeship system is a priority for government - in Budget 2026 I secured an additional €79 million investment in apprenticeship delivery - the largest since the formation of my department.

        "answerText": " Minister for Public Expenditure, Infrastructure, Public Service Reform and Digitalisation  Last week Government published the Accelerating Infrastructure Report and Action Plan. This sets out 30 high-impact reforms targeted at the most significant barriers to the delivery of critical infrastructure. The actions contained in the report are grouped into four pillars.  Pillar 1 focuses on Legal Reform. While Ireland’s legal system is widely considered to be effective and fair, current regulatory and legal processes are acting as significant barriers to the timely delivery of infrastructure. Reforms to the legal system will support better balance towards the common good by addressing the incentives that drive a disproportionate reliance on the courts. These reforms will reduce incentives for excessive litigation, clarify rules on standing and remedies, and introduce fast-track pathways for nationally significant projects that are in the common good, through the development of new legislation.  Within the package of legal reforms detailed in Pillar 1, Action 2 specifically commits to the development and enactment of legislation to accelerate critical infrastructure.  It is envisaged that a Critical Infrastructure Bill will create a legal obligation for State bodies to recognise and accelerate key projects through planning, licensing, and other consenting stages. In addition, the Bill will explore options during drafting for incorporating statutory timelines, positive presumptions, and other measures to reduce procedural delays. This legislation will be accompanied by governance arrangements to maintain and communicate a critical infrastructure projects list and track delivery outcomes.  In parallel with the development of the legislation, I have committed to the creation of an administrative system that will allow Government to designate specific works as critical infrastructure. During the development of this system consideration will be given to the specific projects that might be suitable for designation as critical infrastructure. Any list that may emerge will be subject to Government approval and on passage of a Critical Infrastructure Bill.  By establishing a clear legal basis for prioritisation, it reduces ambiguity and ensures that critical projects and programmes receive coordinated attention across departments, regulators, agencies and the courts. The Bill’s provisions for statutory timelines and streamlined processes will shorten consenting periods and reduce the risk of judicial reviews. It will give a clear articulation of the projects that are in the country’s long-term interests. This clarity will also encourage early engagement and problem-solving, shifting the focus from compliance to delivery. ",

This Critical Infrastructure Bill will also explore options during drafting for incorporating statutory timelines, positive presumptions, and other measures that might reduce procedural delays. The legislation will be accompanied by governance arrangements to maintain and communicate a critical infrastructure projects list and track delivery outcomes.  Work on the general scheme of the Critical Infrastructure Bill will commence immediately. As committed to in the report, in parallel with the legislation, an administrative system that allows the Government to designate the works that are considered to constitute critical infrastructure will be developed. Through both of these strands of work, it is envisaged that Government will have the power to designate critical infrastructure.  These measures will ensure that critical projects are delivered at pace while maintaining transparency, accountability, and compliance with environmental and planning standards. ",

        "answerText": " Minister for Education and Youth  The Primary School Survey, which was launched on 4 November, is due to close on Tuesday 16 December.  The survey – the largest of its kind ever undertaken in Ireland – is school specific and aims to assess demand and preferences for different types of primary school provision including patronage/ethos, co-education or single-sex school provision and language of instruction (English or Irish).  Through the survey, my department is seeking clear information on the preferences of parents and guardians about the primary schools which their children currently attend, or will attend in coming years, on a number of important areas of primary school provision. The results of the survey will help my department plan how education is provided at primary level.  Parents, guardians, primary school staff and primary school Board of Management members have been invited to complete a survey.  I encourage all parents and guardian with children in primary school and all parents and guardians of children not yet in primary school to take this opportunity to complete a survey and “Have Your Say” about the primary school that your children attend now or will attend in the future. I also encourage all primary school staff and Board of Management members to complete a survey on your primary school.  The survey is not a final step. Where there is clear support for change to be considered, a further process of inclusive dialogue will begin.  My department will use the survey results to input into its analysis of national, local and school-specific data to help the department in respect of planning at primary school level. The department will work with relevant stakeholders on actioning the outcomes from the surveys in the context of future school planning.  Initial high-level summary results will be published in early 2026.  The survey can be completed on [ www.gov.ie/primaryschoolsurvey ].  My department has robust arrangements in place to ensure the integrity and security of the primary school survey process. Arrangements for validating survey returns operate after survey returns are received as this facilitates ease of use for survey users.  Information regarding the survey can be accessed on [ www.gov.ie/primaryschoolsurvey ]. ",

It is not a replacement for existing children’s services from which provision will continue. It will commence in specials schools and rollout in time to special classes and mainstream school. It is anticipated that the service will commence in 45 special schools at a later stage in the 2025/26 school year.  The selection process to identify schools for inclusion in the initial phase is ongoing and being informed by engagement with our colleagues in the HSE and the National Council of Special Education (NCSE). It is anticipated that school selection for the initial phase will be complete early in 2026 to ensure that selected schools have the opportunity to engage with the ETS prior to therapist assignment.  Further roll out of the service will occur on a phased basis with a wider roll-out in special schools commencing in the 2026/27 school year.  In the interim schools have access to the NCSE regional therapy support, which provides Teacher Professional Learning (TPL) with follow on/implementation support. These seminars are available nationally for the 2025/2026 school year.  My Department and the National Council for Special Education (NCSE) are committed to delivering an education system that is of the highest quality and where every child and young person feels valued and is actively supported and nurtured to reach their full potential.

        "answerText": " The Taoiseach  I propose to take Questions Nos. 12 to 28, inclusive, together.  The Cabinet committee on infrastructure last met on 3 November and will meet again early in the new year. The Cabinet committee works to drive infrastructure delivery and the implementation of the revised national development plan. As Members know, last week, we brought to Government the essence of that plan. The reform of the delivery of critical, growth-enhancing infrastructure is a key commitment in the programme for Government. Last week marked a major milestone on this agenda with the publication of the accelerating infrastructure report and action plan.  This plan sets out 30 high-impact and time-bound reforms to speed and scale up delivery of homes, roads, public transport, wastewater plants and energy infrastructure. Actions include legislative reforms to balance individual rights and public good, simplify regulation and consenting systems, cut administrative burden and red tape and build public acceptance and a delivery culture. The reforms align with broader housing, climate and competitiveness goals. These will be achieved by streamlining approvals to allow concurrent processing, introducing statutory timelines for major project decisions, rationalising delivery guidance to reduce duplication and complexity, enhancing procurement practices through clearer project pipelines, and fostering a delivery-focused culture that balances safeguards with urgency.  We are at a critical juncture. We have a strong economy and growing population, but our infrastructure delivery is too slow. We have a once-in-a-generation opportunity to transform this. The Government, private sector and communities must align behind delivery. The plan is underscored by the largest capital investment in the history of the State, with over €275 billion planned over the coming ten years.  Over recent weeks, Departments have published their ambitious sectoral investment plans for the next five years. Areas such as energy, transport and water will see a significant scale-up in funding and delivery, all of which will support us to address our infrastructure deficit and scale up housing. There will also be robust oversight of the Government’s performance in achieving these actions with regular reports on progress to the Cabinet committee on infrastructure. In the period ahead, the Cabinet committee will, therefore, oversee both the investments and reforms required to ensure that infrastructure is delivered as efficiently and quickly as possible. \n An Ceann Comhairle  There are 12 Deputies present. They will have 30 seconds each, which means there will be six minutes for questions and six minutes for a response. That is as fair as I can be. \n Deputy Aindrias Moynihan  The recently published national development plan update sets out an ambitious plan for key infrastructure for the years ahead. Many of the capital works are due to get under way by 2030 and others thereafter. Having a pipeline of projects ready is vital because there is so much background work involved with them. I am particularly focused on the ones after 2030. We have seen how the N22 Macroom bypass took many years to advance through the earlier stages, such as the background works, planning and design and so on. The next phase of that road is the piece between Macroom and Ballincollig. It needs to continue in the background and get through the various background stages so that we have a pipeline of projects ready to roll as soon as possible. \n Deputy Ruairí Ó Murchú  We have all seen a huge amount of flood damage and the danger of nature. While a huge amount of work has been done by local authorities and emergency services, this brings to light the need to deal expeditiously with CFRAM protections that are necessary throughout Louth. With regard to the south part of the Dundalk and Blackrock project, the promise is quarter 2 of 2027 for planning application submission. There have been promises and we have been waiting years. \n The Taoiseach  Is that CFRAM? \n Deputy Ruairí Ó Murchú  It is CFRAM. There are five particular projects throughout Louth, in Drogheda, Carlingford, Greenore, Baltray and Ardee. The lack of wastewater capacity is also causing issues. \n Deputy Albert Dolan  We need to double-track the rail line from Galway city to Athenry. The passing loop at Oranmore is under construction now. Ceannt Station is moving to be a station with five platforms. Huge investment has gone in but we must continue it because we are going to wait years for the Galway city outer bypass and the reality is that rail is the lever we can pull. We can build a double track from Athenry to Galway city which would greatly improve the quality of life for all commuters in east Galway. \n Deputy Darren O'Rourke  We need updated wind and solar farm guidelines. The wind farm guidelines are in draft form since 2019 and the last full version was in 2006. There is a commitment in the programme for Government for solar farm guidelines but recent responses say they are at a very early stage of a scoping process. When will they be ready? \n Deputy Paul Murphy  The new roll-out of BusConnects routes has been a disaster in my constituency. Constituents report that buses on the F spine route, which were supposed to provide a more direct route to the city centre and greater connectivity, are taking 20 to 30 minutes longer to get into town and providing fewer options for people trying to get to work or school. It is made worse by the frequent delays and cancellations seen across nearly all routes in Dublin South-West, including the S and W spines operated by Go-Ahead Ireland. Elsewhere, the NTA has been forced to change routes in Finglas and Chapelizod due to protests and people making their voices heard. Will the NTA do the same here or will people be forced to protest? \n Deputy Séamus McGrath  Central to a good infrastructure system is a good public transport system. I welcome the approval of BusConnects Cork by Cabinet to proceed to the planning phase. That is very welcome but we cannot wait years for improvements to the local bus service. I am sure the Taoiseach, like other public representatives in Cork, is inundated with unreliability issues relating to local bus services, such as buses not turning up, disappearing buses and inaccurate information on the travel app. It is simply not good enough and it has been going on for years. People are tired of excuses from the National Transport Authority and Bus Éireann. I ask the Taoiseach to please take this issue up and look for immediate improvements. \n Deputy Tony McCormack  While we prioritise electricity, water and transport, digital connectivity must now be treated equally. It is essential for Ireland's competitiveness. Europe has fallen behind the US and China. 5G stand-alone is under 2% in the EU and 0% in Ireland, compared with 20% in the US and 80% in China. AI, ehealth and advanced manufacturing cannot run on yesterday’s networks. If we want future investment in next-generation technology, connectivity must be prioritised. Will the Cabinet committee on infrastructure evaluate 5G stand-alone as a national priority? During Ireland's EU Presidency, will the Government push for strong, pro-investment digital policy under the digital networks Act? \n Deputy Peadar Tóibín  The Navan to Dublin rail line is not included in the national development plan review as a project that will start to be built before 2030. It has no start date for construction at all at the moment. It is up to a future government to fund the construction of a Navan to Dublin rail line. No money has been assigned or ring-fenced for that particular project, despite the fact there are 90,000 people commuting from Meath at the moment, 60,000 of whom travel by car and add to the M50 crisis. The M50 is currently grinding to a halt. If the Government wants to help fix the M50 crisis, allow people in Meath to use public transport to get to work without pushing them into cars every single day. \n Deputy Paul Lawless  Ireland faces an emergency crisis in terms of infrastructure, housing, energy and water. According to the ESRI, an additional 40,000 construction workers will be needed for the housing plan and an additional 40,000 will be needed for infrastructure. That is 80,000 construction workers who are required to meet the Government’s plan. Indeed, the Dublin metro will require 8,000 construction workers. What is the Taoiseach’s plan in order to achieve this? I speak to construction workers in Australia all the time. They want to come home but they are simply totally disenfranchised and disengaged. The Government has no interest in bringing them home. \n Deputy Rose Conway-Walsh  I know the Taoiseach will agree that the people in Mayo deserve to have proper road infrastructure. I want to specifically talk to him about the R312, which is the main road connecting Erris to the county town of Castlebar. I want it to be designated a regional strategic road because that is the only way it will get the funding it needs. It is a dangerous road. People have put up with it for years but it is time for it to be fixed. \n The Taoiseach  Which one is that? \n Deputy Rose Conway-Walsh  It is the R312. I thank the Taoiseach. \n Deputy Barry Heneghan  Ba mhaith liom ceist a chur ar an Taoiseach faoin flooding we saw in Clontarf yesterday. I thank the Minister of State, Deputy Boxer Moran, for coming down and sorting out the dreaded sandbags, but households and businesses were very worried yesterday. I had tens of people----- \n The Taoiseach  Where was that? \n Deputy Barry Heneghan  Clontarf. Does the Taoiseach not know I am a Clontarf man? The flood defence is critically needed. Will flood defences be included in critical infrastructure with the recent announcement last week? This needs to be fast-tracked and people and businesses need assurance. \n An Ceann Comhairle  Finally, Deputy Conor D. McGuinness. \n Deputy Conor D. McGuinness  Once again, I am raising with the Taoiseach the N25, which is the transport spine of Waterford's infrastructure and long regarded as the most dangerous national road in the State. There has been no funding for safety improvements. Routine maintenance, resurfacing and line painting are not good enough at this stage. Bus stops are being withdrawn. There was another HGV incident this morning just outside Dungarvan. We need to see serious investment in safety improvements on the N25 right from Rosslare to Cork city, but particularly in Waterford where there has been no funding for safety improvements. \n An Ceann Comhairle  Taoiseach, the floor is yours for five minutes. \n The Taoiseach  I love the demarcation lines. The \"Rosslare to Cork city, but particularly in Waterford\" part of it. I am sorry. I get it. Do not worry. \n Deputy Conor D. McGuinness  There have been no safety upgrades. There was a serious incident there this morning. \n The Taoiseach  It is just an observation. I will start with Deputy Aindrias Moynihan, who made a very good point. Hopefully, with this national development plan and the allocation of ten years, we will avoid this stop-start where we get a project from A to B but C is not provided for at all. We had that over the last two decades, I suppose. I recall how the Cork-Limerick road had planning in an earlier era and then that was all shelved after the financial crash and so on. If they had kept the planning going, they would have been in a much better position now to actually start. I do accept that, and particularly on the N22. The Macroom bypass has been extremely effective but there is the problem that you go along a great road into Ballincollig if you are coming from the Kerry side but then you are suddenly into what, as the Deputy was saying to me the other day, is like a parking lot for the next 20 to 40 minutes. It is a very good point that we should encourage Transport Infrastructure Ireland, TII, and others to keep thinking of the next stage and to have the planning ready and preparatory work done. I will work on that particular stretch the Deputy has referenced.  Deputy Ó Murchú raised the flood damage, CFRAM and the five projects in Louth. Deputy Barry Heneghan had a similar point. In general, flood protection schemes take a long time. Some of that is due to stakeholder engagement and public engagement, and there can be objections and so on. If any projects are of such imperative, these are. We do know that when these projects happen, they are effective in protecting against flooding. Towns that had historical flooding events have stopped them because of good infrastructure being put in. These projects invite a lot of objections. We had it in Cork city and it went the whole way to the top courts. It is only now that work is under way and all of that. There was flooding in Cork city this week. It was there because of the tidal levels, but one could argue that if you had the protections in, then businesses and people would have been protected and people could have gone in and out of town. I am very conscious of that.  With regard to Deputy Dolan's question, I will come back to the Minister. It was a good point. I do no know where we are on it in terms of the national development plan but there is no question that Galway city is facing enormous congestion, including all the areas feeding into Galway city. It is a real problem. Public transport, including rail, does give us an option, but not the whole option. We have to get the ring road done. Equally, though, the rail infrastructure is critical. I will talk to the Minister for Transport, Darragh O'Brien, about that.  Deputy O'Rourke raised the issue of the updated wind farm guidelines. The Deputy is correct that they have been a long time coming and technology has changed in the intervening period. I have asked the Minister, James Browne, to accelerate the work on the guidelines. The unit in his Department is also working on planning exemptions. There is a lot of work there. The Department is also working on rural guidelines for housing and one-off housing. There is a lot of work in that Department but I accept that we do need to bring this to a conclusion. At some stage, we need some collective debate on energy. We are all dealing with individual cases of objections to solar, objections to gas generation, objections to wind onshore, and objections to wind offshore potentially. We desperately need the offshore wind. This is something we have got to progress through planning. I am hoping we can get wind farms built, certainly through 2030 to 2031. If we do not, then we are in trouble from an energy perspective. As a collective - when I say \"collective\", I mean the entire Oireachtas - we have to try to stand back and say that there are huge challenges. We discussed security earlier. We are very dependent on the importation of fossil fuels through the interconnectors. There are real issues here that we need to be clear-eyed about. We can then take decisions once everybody realises that there are pluses and minuses in all of this.  Deputy Paul Murphy raised BusConnects, which he said was a \"disaster\"----- \n Deputy Paul Murphy  Some of it. \n The Taoiseach  That is okay. It is a word that is not uncommon. Anyway, I have had my issues with BusConnects down through the years. There have been issues for habitual users of bus services who feel the changing of services or the reorientation of scheduling and so on has eroded what they would have had prior to it. Then we had all the issues around what were, in my view, over-the-top initial plans, which then got rolled back. This seems to have been a pattern throughout the BusConnects journey and I think lessons could be learned from that. A lot of heat built up that perhaps was not necessary in the first place because a lot of stuff that was proposed was then taken away. We will engage with the National Transport Authority, NTA, in terms of what is happening. It has made a lot of progress now on BusConnects. We need a good bus transport system.  That brings me to Deputy Séamus McGrath's point. Yes, I have heard similar reports in terms of reliability. Originally, a year and a half ago, the shortage of drivers was blamed, but we definitely need to improve reliability. There had been very good stuff happening in public transport growth and so on.  I will talk to Deputy McCormack again. The Deputy is absolutely correct that America, China and others are way ahead of us in some of this in the digital space. We need to catch up fairly quickly. I will look at the 5G stand-alone issue.  Deputy Tóibín mentioned the NDP. The Navan rail line is in the NDP review----- \n Deputy Peadar Tóibín  It is not a Bill. \n The Taoiseach  The Deputy has a great capacity. He is brilliant at it, actually. From a political agitation perspective, the Deputy has a great capacity to turn what others would see as success into defeat. For the Deputy in opposition to say that we are not releasing----- \n Deputy Peadar Tóibín  That----- \n An Ceann Comhairle  Do not interrupt. \n Deputy Peadar Tóibín  I have to, a Cheann Comhairle. \n An Ceann Comhairle  No, Deputy Tóibín, do not even dare. \n The Taoiseach  The Deputy is trying to ask how I can----- \n An Ceann Comhairle  Deputy Tóibín will have to look for it afterwards. \n The Taoiseach  I spoke to the Minister, Deputy O'Brien, about this and he is very clear that the Navan line is going ahead. \n Deputy Peadar Tóibín  There is no date for construction. \n An Ceann Comhairle  Do not even think about it. \n The Taoiseach  The Government is absolutely committed to it.  On Deputy Lawless's question, there is a huge increase in apprenticeships. We are recruiting people back. We are anxious for people to come back into the country, and people are coming back into the country. The construction industry is confident enough in terms of the numbers for getting the housing done, for example, and the huge retrofit programme that is going on as well.  I will talk and engage with the Minister in respect of Deputy Conway-Walsh's query on the R312.  Regarding Deputy Heneghan's question, I have discussed that in terms of Clontarf and flood relief generally. It will be part of critical infrastructure, absolutely. I see it as critical infrastructure because it is a big threat to us. The storms are worse and they are more severe. We need to accelerate the protection of people, households and businesses in that respect.  On the N25, we need to get the bypasses along that road. That is a section of the road that definitely needs improvement.  I thank the Ceann Comhairle. \n An Ceann Comhairle  I thank the Taoiseach and Members. For future reference, if there needs to be back and forth, this is not the forum in which to pose a question. \n Deputy Ruairí Ó Murchú  In the review----- \n An Ceann Comhairle  We have a Dáil reform committee today at which it will be discussed. \n The Taoiseach  We need a bit of entertainment and lively engagement, too. \n An Ceann Comhairle  This is not the forum, Taoiseach.

        "answerText": " Minister for Transport  As Minister for Transport, I have responsibility for policy and overall funding in relation to public transport; however, I am not involved in the day-to-day operations of public transport. The National Transport Authority (NTA) has statutory responsibility for securing the provision of public passenger transport services nationally and for the scheduling and timetabling of these services in conjunction with the relevant transport operators.  BusConnects is a transformative programme of investment in the bus system, providing better bus services across our cities. It is the largest investment in the bus system in the history of the state and is managed by the NTA. The aim of the network is to improve the existing Transport for Ireland system through enhanced services with high frequency spines and new local, Orbital and Radial routes.  It is acknowledged that reliability has been a key concern during the initial rollout of Phase 7, with challenges primarily linked to traffic congestion on new city-centre alignments and driver availability. When implementing new phases of the BusConnects network, the NTA continuously monitors services, identifies any issues that arise, and puts in fixes where appropriate. In that context, and as the Deputy may be aware, the NTA have recently announced changes to certain route alignments for Phase 7, including routes 80, 23, and 24, following feedback from passengers and local representatives. These amendments reflect the NTA’s commitment to improving services in direct response to that input.  Notwithstanding this, I would like to reassure the Deputy that Government remains strongly committed to providing all citizens with reliable and realistic sustainable mobility options, and public transport plays a key role in the delivery of this goal. To support this objective, in Budget 2026, the Department of Transport secured €940 million of funding for Public Service Obligation (PSO) and TFI Local Link services (a significant 43% uplift, an increase from €658.4 million in 2025).  My Department will continue to work with the NTA to ensure the redesigned network delivers on its objectives and its performance is closely monitored.  In light of the NTA’s responsibility in this area, I have also forwarded the Deputy's question to the NTA for direct reply. Please advise my private office if you do not receive a response within ten working days. ",

The OPW will act as Sponsoring Agency and Approving Authority for the project and will be responsible for ensuring that the appropriate governance requirements, as provided for in the Infrastructure Guidelines, are adhered to. This includes the strategic assessment and preliminary business case. The term ‘Approval Gate (AG)’ is a reference to approval points during a project’s lifecycle as outlined in the Infrastructure Guidelines.  A project Steering Group is in place. This Group is co-chaired by the Assistant Secretary General (Estate Management) and the State Architect and Principal Architect (both from the OPW) and has representatives from the Department of Culture, Communications and Sport and Dublin City Council.  The Steering Group will establish work streams to facilitate progress across a number of fronts, for example property matters and potential meanwhile uses. The Steering Group will seek inputs from various Government colleagues for consideration, as and when the need arises. The Steering Group will also draw on inputs from external subject matters experts (Technical Consultants) for consideration, as and when required.  The cost range published with the Sectoral Investment Plan is an estimate only, and will be subject to further analysis. As is required by the Infrastructure Guidelines, a range of options will be developed and these will be costed.  The longlist and shortlist of options will be dependent on the outcomes of a non-statutory consultation and engagement process planned with the general public. It is anticipated that the non-statutory consultation and engagement process with the general public will commence in 2026. Having regard to this process, a project timeline will be developed which will include key milestones relating to statutory consents, procurement of services and works, and overall project delivery in a phased manner.

The NCT is designed for a particular purpose, which is to ascertain does a vehicle meet certain roadworthiness tests at a point in time.  Delivery of the NCT service is currently contracted out to a third-party supplier, with the contract managed and overseen by the RSA's customer operations directorate. The service is subject to a stringent regime of independent audits and inspections carried out by the AA. More than 99 per cent of tests reviewed are deemed to be fairly and correctly assessed. A dedicated internal audit team is in place to manage allegations, investigations, and complaints. This involves random surprise audits to review vehicles that had just completed a test. Auditors repeat critical elements of the test and identify if there are any discrepancies with the original test result.  The Deputy may also wish to note that the NCT is accredited to International Organization for Standardization standards. All NCT Inspectors are fully qualified mechanics who undertake an intensive three-week training programme delivered through classroom, practical and online training methods.

        "answerText": " Minister of State at the Department of Education and Youth  The Department of Education and Youth aims to facilitate every individual through learning, to achieve their full potential and to ensure that the education system upholds the rights of every individual to receive an education appropriate to their needs.  To support this, there has been significant growth and investment in disability and special education related supports for students in Ireland. In 2025, €2.9 billion has been allocated, a €159 million increase on 2024. This funding will deliver up to 2,700 new special educational places, an additional 768 teachers and 1,600 special needs assistants. This will mean we will have over 44,000 qualified and committed people in our schools who are focused wholly and exclusively on supporting children with special educational needs.  Current Department of Education and Youth policy is based on a continuum of provision for children and young people with special educational needs, ranging from fulltime placement in mainstream settings to specialist provision, including special schools and classes.  Primary and post-primary schools make provision for students with special educational needs (SEN) through a continuum of interventions ranging from additional support teaching in mainstream schools through to more specialist placements either in a special class or a special school depending on the level of complexity of need. Schools are required to target their additional resources at those students requiring the greatest level of support. Children/young people do not require a psychological assessment or a diagnosis in order to access additional support at school.  A sensory room in a school can enhance and promote the health and wellbeing of the whole school with a focus on both the culture and the environment. It is a designated area within a school which can support a student’s sensory preferences and needs and can provide students with the individualised sensory input they need to self-regulate, so they can be better prepared for learning and interacting with others.  A sensory room is primarily intended for use by students within the school and is not confined to students within a specific classroom.  Such classrooms for pupils with special education needs are included as standard in the accommodation brief for new school buildings and major extension projects. The overall accommodation suite for students with special education needs also generally includes ancillary accommodation such as a Central Activities Space, a Multi Activity Room and Quiet Spaces as well as an outdoor Secure Play Area and Sensory Garden.  In order to make accommodation provision to meet the needs of students with special education requirements, the department has close engagement with the National Council for Special Education (NCSE) which has responsibility for coordinating and advising on the education provision for children nationwide. When the NCSE sanction a special class in a school, the school can apply to the department for capital funding to re-configure existing spaces within the school building to accommodate the class or to construct additional accommodation. Similarly, where special schools wish to expand provision, the school can apply to the department for capital funding to accommodate additional placements.  In addition to a sensory room, a school may have a calming space, the design of which is different to a sensory room. The calming space should be located within or directly off the classroom base and is intended as a safe quiet area that a pupil, under the supervision of a staff member, can access for a short period of time if they need some quiet time to themselves. The design of the space must allow staff to observe pupils unobtrusively from the classroom.  The calming space is designed to ensure that a student may choose to access to take a break or to help with regulation. Calming activities are made available to the student depending on their individual needs’ preferences, and may include items such as stress balls, books, soft toys, and/or noise cancelling headphones.  The NCSE have updated advice on sensory rooms in schools this year. The booklet titled 'Sensory Spaces in Schools', the content of the booklet is based on research evidence and the therapists’ professional experiences of working in schools. This booklet has been created to provide information on sensory processing and advice on the use of sensory spaces that should be used for general purposes. The booklet can be accessed on the NCSE website: www.ncse.ie.  The department are currently providing a “Towards Inclusion Programme”, it is intended as a first step in establishing closer links between the mainstream and special school system in Ireland or further developing existing links; these links to be rooted in the establishment of communities of practice which are focused on the provision of optimal teaching and learning experiences.  Finally, my department is currently Developing a Roadmap for Inclusive Education, with the aid of the European Commission’s Technical Support Instrument programme to take account of the National Council for Special Education’s policy advice on inclusive education and Ireland’s commitments under the United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities. The roadmap is expected to be finalised in Q1 2026. ",

        "answerText": " Minister for Justice, Home Affairs and Migration  While bail laws in Ireland are comprehensive, I am committed to ensuring they are fit for purpose while ensuring fundamental rights principles are adhered to. Last May, I announced that I intended to appoint a Senior Counsel to undertake an assessment of the current operation of bail in Ireland, both legal and practical.  The commissioning of the report arose from concerns regarding bail processes and their applicability to recidivist offenders. These concerns were acknowledged in my apology to the family of the late Shane O’Farrell, who was tragically killed in August 2011, when struck by a car driven by a person who was on bail for a series of offences at the time.  Mr Lorcan Staines SC was subsequently appointed to undertake the review and was asked to include appropriate recommendations, considering the requirements of constitutional justice and the impossibility of refusing bail to every person accused of an offence, particularly a summary offence. His report ‘An Assessment of the Efficacy of Bail Laws in Ireland’ has been completed and was published by my Department last week. I would like to express my thanks to Lorcan Staines for his work in compiling this comprehensive report.  His recommendations include investment in improved information sharing systems for both An Garda Síochána and the Courts Service; the implementation of an adult bail supervision scheme to ensure the proper management of recidivist offenders; changes to bail legislation to significantly expand the conditions which may be attached to the granting of bail; and further legislative amendments to improve the legal framework surrounding bail, including consideration for the legal supports for the expected operational implementation of electronic monitoring in 2026. The electronic monitoring project is progressing and a request for tender for a pilot phase is expected to be issued later this week, and to be operational in Quarter 1 of 2026.  This examination of our bail laws and subsequent proposals underlines the need for additional actions to be considered to ensure the criminal justice system effectively mitigates against risks that may be associated with individuals on bail.  The presiding judge is entirely independent in the exercise of their judicial functions, and the decision to grant or refuse bail in a particular case is solely a matter for the court. The restriction on a person’s liberty prior to conviction is taken very seriously, given the Constitutional presumption that every person is innocent until proven guilty in a court of law.  With that said, it is totally unacceptable that offences are committed by people on bail. That is a direct breach of their promise made when bail is granted by the court. The report is a detailed analysis that will greatly assist in considering how our criminal justice system might better respond to recidivist offenders who persistently break summary laws.  I am committed to keeping our bail laws under review and any further useful amendments that are identified will be introduced as appropriate. ",

        "answerText": " Minister for Justice, Home Affairs and Migration  As the Deputy will be aware Ireland has opted in to the EU Asylum and Migration Pact which is due to enter operation in June 2026. The Pact will provide a fair, sustainable and efficient asylum procedure. This will be achieved through convergence in asylum practices across the EU.  The General Scheme of a new International Protection Bill to give effect to the measures of the Pact was approved by Government on 29 April 2025. The Oireachtas Committee on Justice, Home Affairs and Migration recently conducted pre-legislative scrutiny of the General Scheme. The drafting of the Bill is well advanced and it is expected that the Bill will be published by the end of the year. Enactment of the Bill and commencement of the Act is required by 11 June 2026.  The measures of the Pact, in particular, the Reception Conditions Directive (Directive (EU) 2024/1346), the Asylum Procedures Regulation (Regulation (EU) 2024/1348), and the Asylum and Migration Management Regulation (Regulation (EU) 2024/1351) set out safeguards and procedural guarantees for unaccompanied minors in the international protection process and will be given effect in the International Protection Bill. The Bill will also provide for appropriate alignment with the Screening Regulation (Regulation (EU) 2024/1356). As required by the Pact measures, the Bill will make provision for the appointment of representatives to assist and safeguard the interests of unaccompanied minors.  Additionally, the International Protection Bill, will propose that the determining authority – the replacement for the International Protection Office - will arrange and be responsible for the management of age assessments. The new legislation will set out in far greater detail how age is to be assessed and provide for regulations governing the standards, qualifications of personnel and so on for the purposes of that process.  My Department works closely with Tusla in relation to all matters concerning minors, and is engaging with Tusla to design the new mechanism envisaged under the proposed legislation, and to bring it into effect ahead of the commencement of the EU Asylum and Migration Pact.
