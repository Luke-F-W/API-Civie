This work is not a cost benefit analysis. Rather, it’s primary focus is to map out the data centre landscape in Ireland and to estimate the economic value of data centres across several strands. These strands include: the economic value associated with the construction and operation of data centres; the economic value associated with activities across sectors in Ireland that are enabled by data centres; and the economic value of data centres as it relates to attraction and retention of foreign direct investment.  The research is also considering wider economic benefits as well as other impacts associated with data centres.  Finally, the potential economic impacts to Ireland if we do not continue to develop our data centre landscape further beyond 2030 are assessed and the challenges and opportunities to any further development are presented.  The study output will provide an important evidence base for informing ongoing data centre policy discussions and the conclusion of the work is expected in Q1 2026. ",

        "answerText": " Minister of State at the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage  The commencement of provisions within Part 3 of the Planning and Development Act 2024 on 2 October 2025 provides the statutory basis for the issuing of National Planning Statements. Under the provisions of the Act of 2024 the Minster may, at any time and with the approval of Government, issue a National Planning Statement in relation to planning matters to support proper planning and sustainable development.  National Planning Statements will replace Ministerial guidelines issued under section 28 of the Planning and Development Act 2000 (as amended). Existing Ministerial Guidelines issued under Section 28 of the Act of 2000 will, over time, be revoked and replaced with National Planning Statements. Section 27 (1) of the Act of 2024 states that, notwithstanding the repeal of Section 28 of the Act of 2000, guidelines issued under that section that were in force immediately before the repeal of that section, shall continue in force until revoked or replaced by a National Planning Statement.  The sequence and timing of replacing existing guidelines with National Planning Statements will be decided based on Government priorities.  The delivery of housing is a top priority for Government. The Government’s new housing action plan Delivering Homes, Building Communities supports the delivery of the revised National Planning Framework housing projections which set out the need to plan for the delivery of approximately 50,000 additional homes per annum to 2040. In order to provide much needed certainty to support housing delivery, and strictly without prejudice to current legal proceedings relating to the 'Planning Design Standards for Apartments Guidelines for Planning Authorities', issued in July 2025, a draft National Planning Statement relating to apartment standards is being prepared.  The Housing Action Plan also commits to the preparation of National Planning Statements with regard to short-term letting, rural housing and housing within Gaeltacht areas. In addition, the recently-published Accelerating Infrastructure Taskforce Report and Plan commits to the preparation of a National Planning Statement relating to critical infrastructure. ",

        "answerText": " Minister for Climate, Energy and the Environment  It is understood that the term ‘islanded’ is intended to refer to a data centre fuelled mainly or wholly by fossil fuel and / or a data centre that does not have an electricity connection sufficient to cover its entire energy requirement.  I am advised that it is important to note that Gas Networks Ireland (GNI) does not assign or classify data centres as between “islanded” and “non-islanded”. The exact status of a data centre is primarily a function of the timelines (if any) pertaining to when that data centre will receive an electricity connection to allow them to move to electricity as their primary source.  The gas connection policy, and so GNI’s application process, does not currently require information as to alternative fuel sources and GNI does not formally collect information as to whether a data centre would be ‘islanded’ or indeed the anticipated duration of same.  GNI has provided the following information relating to the connection agreements entered into by GNI in relation to all data centres, together with information as to additional connection applications. This information relates to all formal applications for connection to GNI’s network, including so called ‘islanded’ data centres.     Category    Number    Aggregated Max Hourly Load (MW)      Data Centres contracted to connect to the gas network    11    2,100      Connected to the gas network (of those contracted)    7    1,778      Awaiting connection to the gas network (of those contracted)    4    322      Formal outstanding applications received from Data Centre Sites (but not contracted)    16    5,456**     *Of the 11 that are contracted, 7 are connected whereby 5 of those data centres connected are currently consuming gas  **Projected demand from these enquiries’ ranges from 40.5MW up to 1,300MW; the aggregated demand represents the total developer’s strategic long-term ambition which would be dependent on multiple factors including; ability to gain planning permission for multiple phases, availability of electricity grid capacity, permitting, data centre storage demand and route to market to fund these projects.  Government policy remains that ‘islanded’ data centres (that are not connected to the electricity grid and are powered mainly by on-site fossil fuel generation) would not be in line with national policy.  The new CRU connection policy focused on electricity connections and did not introduce any new decisions relating to connections to the gas network, however I am advised that CRU is actively engaging and will consult with GNI separately on this in the near term.

For ICT roles, the CSOL currently includes Information Technology and Telecommunications Directors (SOC 4 1136) under the broader ICT Professionals (SOC 3 113) category. Where an ICT role is not expressly listed on the CSOL, it may still qualify for a CSEP if the remuneration is over €64,000 and all other criteria are met; otherwise, employers may consider applying for a General Employment Permit subject to the usual requirements for this permit type.  Employers who wish to have eligibility assessed should submit a full application through the Employment Permits Online System (EPOS).

The new single approval process, which will replace the 4-Stage and existing Single Stage approval process, is designed to align particular requirements related to the delivery of social housing, providing a more seamless approval process, with a clear and intentional focus on embedding standardisation and value for money.  This new process will cover all social housing new build and major refurbishment projects up to a value of €200 million, funded via the Social Housing Investment Programme (SHIP) incorporating regeneration and remedial works schemes; and the Approved Housing Body (AHB) Capital Assistance Scheme (CAS).  The new approval process mandates the use of a standardised design approach, as per my Department’s published Design Manual for Quality Housing, and the Employer’s Requirements for Detail Design of Quality Housing, for all new build social housing projects being developed by Local Authorities and Approved Housing Bodies.  Engagement with Local Authorities and the Housing Delivery Coordination Office in the Local Government Management Agency has been underway since Q2 this year via a Sector Working Group dedicated to the single approval process.  The process is in the transition phase at this time and my Department is finalising the necessary circular, guidance notes, templates and documentation in order to ensure rollout of the new process by the end of 2025.  From January all new social housing funding proposals will follow a single approval process. ",

        "answerText": " Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage  The EU Short Term Rental (STR) Regulation was adopted by the EU on 11 April 2024 and is applicable from 20 May 2026. This Regulation lays down harmonised rules on the collection and exchange of data on short-term rental services for member states, hosts providing short-term accommodation rental services, and online platforms that offer services to hosts providing short-term accommodation rental services within the EU.  The Department of Enterprise, Tourism and Employment (DETE) has drafted the Short Term Letting and Tourism (STLT) Bill General Scheme in full alignment with the STR Regulation. The introduction of the STLT Bill will provide a more effective legal and administrative basis to regulate short term lettings. This Bill when enacted will provide the statutory basis for the introduction of a register for all Short Term Lettings in Ireland, which will be implemented and managed by Fáilte Ireland from 20 May 2026.  Following the approval received from Government on the 15 April to generally preclude new planning permissions for STLs in large cities and towns, my Department is working to give effect to this decision. This involves a review of the current Planning Acts with a view to remove references to Rent Pressure Zones in respect of short-term lets.  To ensure that there is a clear view, both at national level and local authority level, as to the overall policy approach to determining planning applications for Short Term Lets, the Department is currently developing a National Planning Statement (NPS) for the short term letting sector to supplement and support the introduction of the STLT Bill. It will consider a variety of factors, such as existing planning legislation, the long term housing need in the local authority area, the location of the proposed short-term let and balancing housing need with the potential impact on tourism and economic development.  Under the Planning and Development Act 2024, NPSs have been introduced to replace section 28 Ministerial Guidelines issued under the Planning and Development Act 2000. These Statements will be prepared by the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage and ultimately subject to approval by Government. ",

As per the Central Bank’s Annual Report for the year ending 2024, the Central Bank’s balance sheet held €18,286,656,000 of foreign holdings in foreign jurisdictions*. Further details can be found in the 2024 Central Bank of Ireland Annual Report and Performance Statement.  The NTMA have informed me that at end-December 2024, the Exchequer had cash and other liquid assets totalling €34.3bn. Of that total, €14.9bn was invested in Treasury Bills issued by European sovereigns and supra-national agencies.  As per the 2024 NTMA Annual Report, at end-December 2024 ISIF’s Discretionary Portfolio (€8.9bn) was comprised of assets in the Global Portfolio (€5bn) and Irish Portfolio (€3.9bn). With respect to the €5bn in the Global Portfolio, €3.6bn was invested in assets domiciled in foreign jurisdictions.  The jurisdiction of individual investments in the Irish Portfolio is not listed in the Annual Report; however, each investment has a “double bottom line” mandate to invest on a commercial basis in a manner designed to support economic activity and employment in Ireland. Detail of all underlying holdings in the Discretionary Portfolio is available in the Portfolio of Investments of the NTMA’s Annual Report for the year ended 2024 (page 287).  At end-December 2024, the Future Ireland Fund held €8.4bn in bonds issued by European sovereigns and supra-national agencies. At end-December 2024, the Infrastructure, Climate and Nature Fund held €2bn in bonds issued by European sovereigns and supra-national agencies.   *Foreign jurisdictions’ was taken to mean all holdings by issuers outside of Ireland that are held in the Bank’s investment portfolio. The Bank’s monetary policy holdings, IMF holdings, and pension holdings were excluded from the below analysis.  ",

As per the Central Bank’s Annual Report for the year ending 2024, the Central Bank’s balance sheet held €7,844,393,000 of holdings in foreign jurisdictions* outside the EU. Further details can be found in the 2024 Central Bank of Ireland Annual Report and Performance Statement.  The NTMA have informed me that the Exchequer did not hold any assets from foreign jurisdictions outside the European Union at end-December 2024.  As per the 2024 NTMA Annual Report, at end-December 2024 ISIF’s Discretionary Portfolio (€8.9bn) was comprised of assets in the Global Portfolio (€5bn) and Irish Portfolio (€3.9bn). With respect to the €5bn in the Global Portfolio, €2.7bn was invested in assets domiciled outside of the European Union.  The jurisdiction of individual investments in the Irish Portfolio is not listed in the Annual Report; however, each investment has a “double bottom line” mandate to invest on a commercial basis in a manner designed to support economic activity and employment in Ireland. Detail of all underlying holdings in the Discretionary Portfolio is available in the Portfolio of Investments of the NTMA’s Annual Report for the year ended 2024 (page 287).  At end-December 2024, The Future Ireland Fund and the Infrastructure, Climate and Nature Fund did not hold any assets from foreign jurisdictions outside the European Union.   *Foreign jurisdictions outside the EU’ was taken to mean all holdings by issuers outside of the Eurosystem that are held in the Bank’s investment portfolio .The Bank’s monetary policy holdings, IMF assets, and pension assets were excluded from the above analysis.

        "answerText": " Minister of State at the Department of Justice  All applications for a certificate of naturalisation are assessed individually in accordance with the provisions of the Irish Nationality and Citizenship Act 1956, as amended.  Section 15 of the Act sets out the statutory conditions that must be fulfilled for a certificate of naturalisation to be granted. Section 16 of the Act gives discretion to waive the statutory conditions in certain circumstances, including where the applicant is of Irish descent or Irish associations (related through blood, affinity or adoption to a person who is or is entitled to be an Irish citizen).  Earlier this year my Department published guidelines for applications on the basis of Irish Associations under Section 16(1)(a) of the Irish Nationality and Citizenship Act 1956. The guidelines provide clarity to both applicants and decision-makers. They set out the factors that may be considered when deciding whether to waive the statutory conditions in certain circumstances, including where the applicant is of Irish descent or Irish associations.  The guidelines have been developed in the interests of fair and transparent procedures and comprehensive decision making. Details of the guidelines are available on my Department’s website at the following link: www.irishimmigration.ie/how-to-become-a-citizen/.  Following the publication of the new guidelines, my Department then wrote to over 1,500 people with ongoing Section 16 applications advising them of the recently published guidelines and afforded them an opportunity to them to provide additional documentation, should they wish.  I can advise the Deputy that a significant number of submissions relating to Section 16 'Irish Association' applications have been received, and that decisions on these applications have begun to issue. Applications had been on hold pending the publication of the guidelines.  I can inform the Deputy that it is not currently feasible to provide statistics on the current processing times and decisions based on Section 16 'Irish Association'. This would require the manual examination of a large number of files.  Following the introduction of the new Section 16 guidelines, arrangements to separately record such applications have now been put in place and will allow for the provision of better statistical data in the near future. My expectation is that once an appreciable number of decisions have been reached, my Department will be in a better position to provided indicative timeframes for processing.

As announced in the context of Budget 2026, €36 million will be available in 2026 for early learning and childcare capital programmes. This will include investment in new buildings through the State-led early learning and childcare programme, continued investment in expansion of existing early learning and childcare operators through the Building Blocks scheme and a number of quality initiatives including supports to childminders.  The Buildings Blocks Extension Scheme is providing investment to existing early learning and childcare providers to expand their provision by means of extensions to existing buildings, or in the case of community not-for-profit operators, to purchase or construct buildings on new sites. The current scheme closed for applications in January 2025.  Officials in the Department are currently examining options and detailed specifications for future Building Blocks schemes, and I expect to announce details in early 2026. ",

        "answerText": " Minister for Children, Disability and Equality  The Access and Inclusion Model (AIM) is designed to support Early Learning and Care providers in delivering an inclusive preschool experience, enabling children with additional needs to fully participate in the Early Childhood Care and Education (ECCE) programme and benefit from quality preschool provision. As such, AIM is directly linked to ECCE participation and currently applies only to children who meet the ECCE age eligibility criteria. The current arrangements also ensure that all children have the same entitlement of 2 years of ECCE regardless of their birth date.  The ‘First 5’ whole-of-government strategy commits to the phased extension of AIM, a commitment that was reaffirmed by the findings of an independent end-of-year-three evaluation conducted by the University of Derby and published in January 2024. Participants in the evaluation, including providers, educators, and parents, strongly supported the scaling up of AIM. They also expressed a desire to see AIM extended to hours outside of the ECCE entitlement.  Based on the evaluation’s findings, AIM is now being extended on a phased basis as funding becomes available. Since September 2024, targeted AIM supports are available to ECCE-eligible children outside of ECCE hours—both during term time and in holiday periods. Children can now access up to three additional hours per day during the ECCE term and up to six hours per day outside of term, through the National Childcare Scheme (NCS).  The Programme for Government commits to ‘examine and expand the Access and Inclusion Model and make it available to younger children.’ Officials in the Department are currently considering the policy implications and appropriate mechanisms to extend AIM to children aged under three. It is critical that any extension of AIM supports to this cohort are evidence-based and reflective of their needs. It is intended that, over time, all children with additional needs registered in Early Learning and Care services will have access to supports under AIM. ",

The process to conclude the Council Decision concerning the opening of negotiations on the amendment of the 2018 Agreement in the form of an Exchange of Letters between the European Union and the Kingdom of Morocco is nearing its conclusion.  Throughout the process, Ireland has made clear our view that the compatibility of the agreement with the fundamental principle in international law of the right of peoples to self-determination should be paramount in the implementation of this agreement.  Ireland’s position on Western Sahara continues to be guided by the aim of achieving a just and lasting political solution which will provide for the self-determination of the people of Western Sahara.  Officials at HQ and in the Mission network continue to be in contact with relevant parties in support of efforts to achieve a solution to this long-standing dispute. This includes representatives of the Polisario Front, with whom my officials recently met in October and November. During both of these engagements the subject of Western Sahara was discussed. ",

The European Commission, which leads on trade negotiations, has engaged with the UAE on three rounds of negotiations, with a fourth scheduled for early December.  For Ireland, delivering a modern and ambitious FTA with the UAE will not only reinforce EU and Irish relations with the UAE, but also support the important goal of market diversification via an expanded set of EU FTAs.  Our support for enhanced trading relationships does not mean that we avoid difficult issues. Ireland has discussed the engagement of the UAE in Sudan bilaterally with the UAE at Ministerial and official level. The UAE has consistently denied the allegations. We will continue to engage with the UAE on all aspects of the situation in Sudan.  Together with our EU partners, Ireland has been very clear that external engagement in the conflict must end. At the May 2025 meeting of the EU-Gulf Cooperation Council Political Committee, Ireland, speaking on behalf of the EU, stressed the need to use every influence to prevent external actors from providing arms to combatants and to unite in favour of peace.  In a November statement by the High Representative, the EU reiterated the messages set out in October’s Council Conclusions on Sudan. The EU calls on all external actors to take the necessary measures to end the sale or supply of arms and related material to all parties, in accordance with the UN arms embargo. The EU will continue to advocate for the expansion of the arms embargo to the whole territory of Sudan.  Specific allegations of violations of the UN embargo and EU sanctions are pursued through UN and EU channels. Ireland continues to call on all parties to comply fully with their obligations and to refrain from any actions that prolong the conflict and fuel further violence. ",

Each Member State has different rules regarding treaties, both the joining and exiting of them. In Ireland’s case, a decision to withdraw from an international treaty, such as the Energy Charter Treaty, is a matter of executive power under Article 29 of the Irish Constitution and will require a Government Decision.  Regarding the bringing of a Memorandum to Government, this will be brought by my colleague the Minister for Foreign Affairs given her formal role in international treaties, and this decision will formally end Ireland’s membership. My officials are working with the Department of Foreign Affairs to expedite this process.  The Government is committed to exiting the ECT as soon as is practicable, and the relevant Memorandum is expected to be brought to Government in the near future.  Ireland is still a member of the Treaty and will remain so until we officially leave. The modernised treaty provides for less exposure to investor claims than the original treaty, and the modernised Treaty is available to view on the ECT website. However, the Government's position remains that Ireland will exit the Treaty. ",

The Programme for Government acknowledges the increased energy cost pressures on households and commits to bringing forward measures to contain energy costs and tackle energy poverty. Government has introduced a suite of measures over recent years to help households and businesses deal with the cost of energy. In Budget 2026, Government approved an extension of the 9% VAT rate currently applied to gas and electricity until 31 December 2030, saving households up to €100 per year.  From January 2026, the Fuel Allowance payment will increase by €5 to €38 per week equating to an increase of more than 15%. This will provide an additional €140 to over 450,000 recipients during the annual fuel allowance season. This payment has also been expanded to include those in receipt of the Working Family Payment. In addition, people moving from the Disability Allowance or Blind Pension to take up work from September 2026 will keep their Fuel Allowance for five years. The Department of Social Protection can also provide support through the Additional Needs Payment to help households meet expenses, including those who face difficulties with fuel bills.  It is important to note that under the Supplier Energy Engage Code, suppliers will not disconnect customers who engage with them and must provide every opportunity to customers to avoid disconnection. In addition, the Commission for Regulation of Utilities has put in place a range of other regulatory protections to support consumers.  My Department has also established a cross-Government National Energy Affordability Taskforce to identify, assess and implement measures that will enhance energy affordability for households and businesses, while delivering key renewable commitments and protecting security of supply and economic stability. The work programme of the taskforce will examine how targeted schemes can best assist households in energy poverty. The taskforce has developed an interim report, which set out measures for consideration as part of the Budget 2026 process. This report has been published on Gov.ie, in advance of further analysis and the publication of the Energy Affordability Action Plan in 2026. ",

This approach involves prioritising investment in the protection and renewal of existing assets before investing in new ones, on economic and environmental grounds.  This funding will see significant advancements made in a number of public transport projects, including commencing construction on DART+ Programme.

Following the purchase of the complex, the Department contracted the current provider to oversee the management and provision of service for the gym and the existing workforce was maintained under the transitional agreement.  Due to the public disorder outside of the Citywest Hotel and Convention Centre campus, access had to be restricted to the campus for residents, staff, and members of the public accessing services including the leisure centre and restaurant. This measure was taken to protect the safety of all people who may be on the campus. Members of the leisure centre were informed about the access restrictions by the management.  Access to the Leisure Centre was restored to members on a reduced hours basis from Tuesday November 11. Current opening hours are 6am – 6pm Monday to Friday and 8am – 6pm Saturday to Sunday. Under the current measures, the Leisure Centre is open three hours longer than usual at weekends - closing one hour later, at 5pm, on Saturdays and two hours later, at 6pm, on Sundays.  Security huts have been put in place at the entrance to the Citywest campus and at various locations on site, including at the designated car park for members accessing the Leisure Centre. Additional lighting and CCTV have been put in place both in the Leisure Centre car park and along the main route through the campus.  The Department is working closely with An Garda Síochána and keeping security arrangements at the campus under review, including a possible return to previous opening hours of the Leisure Centre and parking arrangements.  While security concerns and assessments are ongoing, the Leisure Centre will operate under the current arrangements. Local public representatives and community members will be kept informed if there is any update for members and people living in the locality. ",

This also means they gain access to the full range of housing supports available to all Irish residents, which are not available to people going through the application process.  To help people move from IPAS accommodation to find housing options in the community, IPAS has a team that works in collaboration with DePaul Ireland, the Peter McVerry Trust, the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage, and Local Authorities.  There is a need for people with status to transition living independently in our communities, improving their integration into our society while also creating space within IPAS accommodation for newer arrivals.  It is essential that IPAS maintains enough accommodation to meet the needs of new applicants, who have a legal entitlement to IPAS accommodation, do not have immediate access to the labour market, and do not have access to standard housing benefits or standard social welfare entitlements.

This also means they gain access to the full range of housing supports available to all Irish residents, which are not available to people going through the application process.  To help people move from IPAS accommodation to find housing options in the community, IPAS has a team that works in collaboration with DePaul Ireland, the Peter McVerry Trust, the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage, and Local Authorities.  There is a need for people with status to transition living independently in our communities, improving their integration into our society while also creating space within IPAS accommodation for newer arrivals.  It is essential that IPAS maintains enough accommodation to meet the needs of new applicants, who have a legal entitlement to IPAS accommodation, do not have immediate access to the labour market, and do not have access to standard housing benefits or standard social welfare entitlements.

        "questionNumber": 1,
        "answerText": " Deputy Eoin Ó Broin  There were many omissions in the Minister's ill-fated housing plan launched only a matter of weeks ago but one that was particularly astonishing is the removal of targets, either across the life cycle of the plan or, indeed, on an annual basis, for cost-rental and affordable purchase homes delivered by local authorities, approved housing bodies, AHBs, and the Land Development Agency, LDA. Can the Minister explain why these targets that were in his predecessor's plan were removed and does that mean he has abandoned targets or he is simply not willing to share them with us? \n Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage (Deputy James Browne)  I thank the Deputy for this important question around targets for the delivery of cost-rental and affordable purchase homes by local authorities, approved housing bodies and the LDA under the Government's new housing plan.  Affordability and the chance to own a home is at the heart of Government's housing policy, as embodied within the new housing plan, Delivering Homes, Building Communities 2025-2030. Government is investing an unprecedented level of funding to support new housing delivery, which will underpin the new starter homes programme, delivering an average of 15,000 affordable housing supports annually to 2030.  To further drive the delivery of affordable housing under the plan, local authorities will shortly commence the preparation of new housing delivery action plans. It is intended that the plans will set out how the starter homes programme will be implemented in each area, including the full suite of affordable housing supports to be provided and taking account of local and national affordability needs. They should be responsive to the housing system landscape in each area, as it is evident that starter homes supports needs and requirements vary by location.  The preparation of housing delivery action plans for starter homes will be undertaken by local authorities, in close collaboration with their delivery partners, including the LDA, and approved housing bodies. Each local authority's starter homes programme, as outlined in its housing delivery action plan, will be informed by the housing needs and demand assessment framework, which will assist in identifying and quantifying new housing need with affordability constraint within their administrative area. Quarterly housing delivery reports will continue to be published on the Department's website, tracking the progress of affordable delivery output in each local authority area. The delivery of 300,000 homes and 15,000 starter homes supports, over the lifetime of the plan, is ambitious but it is achievable. \n Deputy Eoin Ó Broin  I would like the House to note that the Minister, of course, completely avoided the question and instead gave what can only be described as an Orwellian response to a simple question.  There is no new starter home programme. What the Government has done is it has taken a bunch of schemes that existed under the previous Government's plan and, indeed, its predecessor, it has bundled them all up and it has added them into a global figure.  The reason it is important, in particular, that there are targets for the delivery of cost rental and affordable purchase is the Minister funds them. He sets the targets for local authorities, AHBs and the LDA, directly and indirectly, to deliver those homes. Of course, as we know, last year the cost-rental targets were missed by a factor of 15% and the Minister's affordable purchase target was missed by a staggering 61%.  On top of that, of course, increasingly these homes are not affordable. Right across Dublin, for example, the full price of a so-called \"affordable home\" delivered under the Minister's affordable purchase scheme, if you want to own the home outright, is up to €500,000. In nobody's calculations is that affordable.  Similarly, we are now seeing cost rents coming in as high as €19,000 a month for a three-bedroom house, and €17,000 a month for a two-bedroom unit. A growing number of people who are not eligible for social housing are excluded from the Minister's schemes. Can I ask again why he has not included a specific target for cost rental and affordable purchase? Has he ditched the target or is he just hiding it from us? \n Deputy James Browne  We have targets of 300,000 new homes overall, including 15,000 affordable homes annually, and each local authority is now working on their housing delivery action plans. They are looking at and working with their partners as well to ensure they can meet the Government's target of delivering homes. That is what we are doing and that is how we will deliver the homes. \n Deputy Eoin Ó Broin  If that is the case, why would the Minister not say he has a target for new-build social homes? Again, this is a scheme that he funds and a scheme that local authorities and approved housing bodies deliver, some in conjunction with the Land Development Agency. It makes no sense to say that we do not need targets for cost rental and affordable purchase but we do for social housing. Again, it is a very simple question. There were clear targets for next year, some of which the Minister shared with us in the committee only a matter of months ago. My question, which the Minister has not answered, is very simple. Why is there no target for cost rental over the six years? Why is there no target for affordable purchase over the six years? Why is the Minister not accepting that in addition to not producing enough of these homes, increasingly they are unaffordable? Targets are important. They are particularly important for Government schemes funded by the Minister's Department. It allows him to plan, to programme and to be held to account. It sounds like the Minister has effectively abandoned the very meagre targets for cost rental and affordable purchase schemes that his predecessor had in his plan because this Minister knows that cannot be met, and rather than be embarrassed by his failure, he is simply ditching the targets altogether. Frankly, that is not good enough. \n Deputy James Browne  We have not abandoned it. We have our key target of 300,000 new homes and 15,000 affordable homes. What we have learned over the last number of years is that we need to be flexible in figuring out exactly how we are going to manage to deliver the affordable homes that people need across this country. We do have a plan, which is clearly set out and was launched only very recently, with the methods and the means by which we are going to deliver social homes and affordable homes and increase the activity of private homes that also need to be delivered. Without the private investment to deliver private homes, we are never going to solve the housing crisis because we are never going to be able to deliver enough homes. The supply of homes is what is crucial here. We have our target of 15,000 affordable homes annually. This is what we are working towards as we go through each local authority and as we look at the national landscape, for how we can best and most quickly deliver that. Rather than getting obsessed about the minutiae of small targets, we look at how we can unleash the deliverability of homes. My purpose and my aim is to ensure that people can get access to a home.

        "answerText": " Deputy Eoin Ó Broin  The Minister has published legislation that is going to make the most profound changes to the regulation of rents in the private rental sector in over a decade. From March of next year, tens of thousands of renters, progressively, quarter on quarter, are going to lose the meagre protections of the rent pressure zones and over time see their rents reset to market rents. Astonishingly, the Minister's Department conducted no analysis of the impacts of these changes on the rents that renters actually pay. Why did he not conduct that analysis and how can he stand over a Bill when even he does not know the full impact it will have on hard-pressed renters paying rip-off rents? \n Deputy James Browne  Following on from a review of the private rental sector published by my Department in July 2024, the Housing Agency was commissioned to undertake a comprehensive review of the current system of rent controls using RPZs. The key focus of the review was to assess the operation of RPZs since their introduction and consider their impact on the market and relevant stakeholders, including the retention of landlords and new investment. It considered whether RPZs should continue without change or be removed, modified or replaced. The review, which was extensive and detailed, also included options and recommendations in relation to potential amendments to rent control.  On 10 June 2025, the Government approved policy measures including modifications to rent controls to come into effect on 1 March 2026 in order to boost investment in the supply of homes available for rent and keep existing landlords in the market. The modifications to rent controls have been informed by the findings of the Housing Agency review. The policy measures announced by the Government also include significant improvements in security of tenure for renters. The Government has provided additional resources to the Residential Tenancies Board to support the efficient regulation of the rental market. Multiple expert reports, including those from the Housing Agency, the Department of Finance, the ESRI, the OECD and the IMF agree that the current RPZ system is a major obstacle to increasing rental supply. These changes are being introduced in order to attract increased investment in the rental market and thereby increase the supply of properties available for renters. My Department has consulted extensively with the Office of the Attorney General in relation to the proposed legislation. On 14 October 2025, the Government approved the general scheme of the residential tenancies (amendment) (No. 2) Bill 2025. This legislation is now subject to priority legal drafting and pre-legislative scrutiny is currently under way. \n Deputy Eoin Ó Broin  The House should note for the second time tonight that the Minister has studiously avoided the question. What do we know about tenancies? The Residential Tenancies Board tells us that the average length of a tenancy is three and a half years long. In the past 12 months, 70,000 fresh first-time tenancies were created. That is 28% of the total number of private rental tenancies. If those trends continue - trends that have been in train for a number of years - then within four years, the overwhelming majority of renters will be captured by this legislation. Many tens of thousands of them will have their rents reset to market rent at the start and all of them will have the market rent reset at the end of six years. I accept there is a viability problem. I accept there is a lack of investment, particularly in social, cost-rental and affordable for purchase homes. However, renters should not be the ones to pay the bill. What the Minister is proposing, in addition to inadequate and possibly illegal apartment design standards for smaller and darker apartments and huge VAT reductions for developers who are building apartments that are already viable, is to essentially allow landlords to reset the rent to almost double what it is for many tenants. He has not even done an analysis. Why not and why is he making renters pay for viability challenges the Minister and his failing housing policy created in the first place? \n Deputy James Browne  When the Deputy was quoting the statistics from the RTB he left out the fact that in the situation that prevailed in the country at the time around rent pressure zones, it was temporary and partial around the country. We have now created a national rent pressure zone with a view to a national rental control situation. Also, the reason I am bringing in these changes is to bring in, for the first time in this State, security of tenure for tenants. That does not exist in this State. Theoretically, there are tenancies with no end of duration but it is too easy to end those tenancies. We are severely restricting how tenancies can be ended by landlords. That is to ensure there is that security of tenure. I believe that you will see far less frequent notices to quit as a result of this security of tenure being brought in for tenants. That is going to be the crucial difference here. \n Deputy Eoin Ó Broin  With the greatest of respect, security of tenure is no use if you simply cannot afford the rent. The family homelessness crisis started in 2014, not because landlords were selling but because landlords were hitting tenants with double digit rent increases. Over the space of three to four years, the number of children in homelessness went from 800 to over 3,000. As for the so-called security of tenure measures, the Minister is going to create three different types of security of tenure; for existing tenants in existing tenancies, for new tenancies in existing properties of small landlords and new tenancies in properties of large landlords. That is a level of complexity that will be impossible to understand and virtually impossible to enforce. The only reason he has done this is to try to hide behind that while he guts the rent pressure zones and forces renters to pay levels of rent that are simply unacceptable. The Minister has no idea if notices of termination will increase or decrease. Neither he nor his Department have done any analysis on the impact on rents or security of tenure. Landlords are unhappy. Tenants are unhappy. This will not work and who is going to pay the price? Renters. Because Fianna Fáil does not give a damn about them. \n Deputy James Browne  What is crucial is that those who are currently renting and those who are living at home who need somewhere to rent have somewhere to rent. That means increasing supply. That is what----- \n Deputy Eoin Ó Broin  Cost-rental supply, social supply, affordable purchase supply. \n Deputy James Browne  An increased supply of all tenures, including social, affordable and private houses and apartments. \n Deputy Eoin Ó Broin  It is not apartments costing €3,000 per month. Get your head out of the sand. \n Deputy James Browne  We have to drive supply. That will in turn bring about the end of homelessness, so we have the properties that people will live in. It will also drive down rents by increasing supply. \n Deputy Eoin Ó Broin  Utter nonsense. \n Deputy James Browne  We have seen that in the past when the supply increases. \n Deputy Eoin Ó Broin  How will apartments for €3,000 per month lower homelessness and lower prices? \n Deputy James Browne  That is what is crucial from my perspective, delivering the homes that are needed. While the Deputy has endless criticisms of everything that is being done across here----- \n Deputy Eoin Ó Broin  Affordable homes are needed and the Minister is not delivering them. \n Deputy James Browne  You have to have solutions as well, Deputy. This is the usual from Sinn Féin. When you are saying something----- \n Deputy Eoin Ó Broin  Sit down, you are embarrassing yourself at this stage, really. \n Deputy James Browne  The Deputy is the only person embarrassing himself. \n Deputy Eoin Ó Broin  Homelessness will increase month on month as a result of these failed policies. \n Deputy James Browne  It is the usual tactic from Sinn Féin in the lifetime of this Government. When somebody is saying something and you do not want it heard----- \n Deputy Eoin Ó Broin  I do not want to hear it, but I would like an answer to the question that you will not answer, repeatedly, over and over. \n Deputy James Browne  -----you talk them down and shout over them. You shout over them because you do not want anybody to hear. It is a really underhanded tactic. \n An Cathaoirleach Gníomhach (Deputy Pádraig O'Sullivan)  Minister, time is up. \n Deputy Eoin Ó Broin  People can see your housing policy failures writ large. \n Deputy James Browne  You should respect people's democratic right to speak in this Chamber.

        "answerText": " Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage  I recently announced a new partnership approach to enable the private sector to develop wastewater treatment facilities, working in collaboration with Uisce Éireann, for smaller housing developments. This approach will allow the private sector to play a greater role in delivering wastewater infrastructure that is constructed to Uisce Éireann standards. This will provide much needed capacity to facilitate housing delivery particularly in small towns and villages where infrastructure constraints have held back development.  Under the new arrangements, Uisce Éireann will be involved from the outset—from design through to commissioning—ensuring that all infrastructure is built to agreed national standards. Uisce Éireann will take responsibility for regulatory compliance and, once constructed, will own and operate the infrastructure. This provides a clear and reliable pathway for new wastewater assets to enter public ownership, safeguards environmental and technical standards, and avoids the uncertainty that existed under previous developer-provided infrastructure (DPI) arrangements.  The challenges that arose under previous arrangements for developer-provided infrastructure are well recognised. The key safeguard in the new proposals is that Uisce Éireann will ultimately own and operate all new infrastructure, provided it is built to its standards. This ensures that the failures associated with past arrangements cannot be repeated.  In relation to legacy DPI, responsibility for remediation has rested with Uisce Éireann since 1 January 2024. A multi-stakeholder group involving Uisce Éireann, local authorities and my Department is overseeing this work, and a coordinated national plan is being developed to address the approximately 450 estates affected. Given the scale and complexity of the issues, resolving all locations will take time.  Work is underway, led by Uisce Éireann and in close cooperation with local authorities, to review the position in the approximately 450 affected estates and to determine the actions needed to address these legacy issues.  My Department will continue to work with Uisce Éireann and local authorities to support a sustainable and workable approach for both new developments and legacy estates. ",

        "answerText": " Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage  I propose to take Questions Nos. 17, 19, 28 and 103 together.  The Government has published the new housing plan, Delivering Homes, Building Communities: An Action Plan on Housing Supply and Targeting Homelessness’, which aims to deliver 300,000 new homes by the end of 2030.  Under Pillar 1, to increase the supply of additional housing, Action 4.8 commits to increase the number of development types that are exempt from planning permission to enable homeowners to adapt or extend their homes more easily, including attic conversions, subdivisions of existing homes and detached accommodation within the primary dwelling boundary.  This Action will be progressed through the continued commencement of the Planning and Development Act 2024 (Act of 2024), including, inter alia, the consequential review of the current Exempted Development Regulations which is ongoing.  Progress on this review has already been made in 2025, with the successful public consultation that took place over the summer – there was significant engagement with the public and relevant stakeholders on exempted development regulations, with over 900 submissions received via the online consultation portal.  These submissions have been reviewed over the autumn and will inform the new draft Exempted Development Regulations which will be implemented on a phased basis, by theme, with the exemptions relating to domestic dwellings being prioritised and forthcoming in the coming months.  This will includes exemptions for stand-alone detached housing units in the back gardens of residential properties, with final decisions on the specifics of any potential revisions communicated as soon as possible.  When completed, the new draft Exempted Development regulations are subject to Environmental consideration, before being laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas. This will also necessitate engagement with the Joint Oireachtas Committee for Housing, Local Government and Heritage.  It is intended that new Regulations under the Act of 2024 will be signed into law in tandem with the commencement of Part 2 and Part 4 of the Act of 2024 and the updated exempted development provisions will form part of the new Regulations.  While the commencement of Part 4 of the Act of 2024 is awaited, certain elements of the new exempted development provisions, including agricultural effluent storage arising from the need to facilitate compliance with the EU Nitrates Directive, are being progressed for advance inclusion in the current Regulations, which Minister Cummins, as the Minister of State with responsibility for Planning, will sign into law at the earliest opportunity and will also be carried forward into the new Regulations.  In the meantime, the provisions of the Planning and Development Act 2000, as amended (Act of 2000), and associated Planning and Development Regulations 2001 (Regulations of 2001) remain in force until the relevant sections of the Act of 2024 are commenced and the corresponding sections of the Act of 2000 are repealed. Unless specifically exempted, all development requires planning permission and all habitable space must comply with the requirements of building control and fire safety. ",

The review is a scoping report and as such it does not make findings as to the truth or otherwise of allegations that have been made by an individual against named persons. The Attorney General's office has been consulted on both the content of the report and also on the issue of its potential publication and dissemination.  Further, regarding the publication of the Mulcahy Report, the decisions of the Commissioner for Environmental Information (OCE-103174-W9G4J2 (Legacy Reference CEI-18-0019)) of 13 February 2019 and the Information Commissioner (OIC-59426-Q8D7T8) of 27 February 2020 in relation to requests to publish this report will also be taken into account. Both decisions are publicly available on those bodies' websites.  It should be noted that in each of these cases, both the Commissioner for Environmental Information and the Information Commissioner decided not to grant access to the report. The Office of the Information Commissioner decision stated \"placing the details concerned in the public domain would significantly breach the rights to privacy of identifiable individuals.\" Furthermore, the decision of the Office of the Commissioner for Environmental Information notes that the report does not contain \"significant \"wider\" recommendations\" that could be applicable to the planning system as a whole.  Therefore, the publication of the report, or any summary which may allow the identification of individuals, requires careful consideration given that the report details unproven allegations against named persons.

It is a wide-ranging action plan focused on housing supply and targeting homelessness. The Plan aims to create the conditions needed to increase private investment and development to support the delivery of 300,000 homes. This includes the provision of more zoned land, providing more housing-related infrastructure, reforming the planning system, measures to address viability and improving access to finance to support the residential construction sector. The Plan also encourages and supports the development of the SME homebuilder sector directly in a number of ways.  To improve access to equity finance, the Plan commits to a new €400 million equity risk capital investment programme for homebuilding over the next three years.  To ensure that Home Building Finance Ireland has the capacity to provide finance to homebuilders across the country, particularly SME homebuilders, Government has committed a further €200 million of additional external funding.  To increase SME participation and competition in public procurement, a new national procurement strategy will be introduced.  To support the growth of SME homebuilders, the Land Development Agency will actively seek to engage the sector in the roll out of its regional programme of work.  Enterprise Ireland will also double overall investment in SME firms in the residential construction sector, under its Built to Innovate programme, to drive adoption of efficient construction practices and the use of MMC.  They will also introduce a tailored training and mentorship programme on Strategic Financial Leadership to assist with financial management in ambitious SMEs.  Additionally, I will establish a contractor-led renewal programme which will afford opportunities for local trades-persons and contractors to work with local authorities and AHBs to tackle vacancy and dereliction and I intend to expand the Ready to Build Scheme, opening it up to SME homebuilders.  Taken together, this action will create the conditions for the expansion of private sector activity, particularly SMEs. ",
