        "answerText": " Minister for Transport  The Electric Small Public Service Vehicle Scheme (eSPSV) supports the uptake of EVs in the SPSVs sector (taxis, hackneys, and limousines).  In recognition of the important role the sector plays in decarbonising the broader transport system, the scheme increased from €2m in 2020 to €15m in 2021, 2022 and 2023, with grants of up to €20K available to existing SPSV drivers who scrap older, high mileage vehicles for new full electric models. Drivers can apply for grants of up to €10,000 towards the purchase of a new full battery eSPSV with a further €2,500 available to convert it to a wheelchair accessible model.  Those scrapping older, more polluting, or high mileage vehicles are now eligible for double the normal grant if they make the switch to electric with €20K available for a new full electric or €25K for a wheelchair accessible new battery electric vehicle. The scheme is continuing in 2024 with an overall allocation of €12.5m.  As of end of September there were 398 grants paid under the 2024 Electric SPSV scheme to the value of €6,949,000.  The eSPSV scheme will continue in 2025 with budget allocation to be confirmed. "

        "answerText": " Minister for Transport  The Climate Action and Low Carbon Development Acts 2015-2021 commit to a net-zero carbon future in Ireland by 2050 and an economy-wide 51% reduction in emissions by 2030. For the transport sector specifically, this translates to a reduction of 50% of 2018 emissions by 2030 as per sectoral emissions ceilings set by Government in July 2022.  While it is clear that meeting these targets will present challenges, my Department remains committed to providing sustainable alternatives to private car travel, and accelerating a range of measures that will help us reach our sustainable transport targets as laid out in the Climate Action Plan. Measures have included an unprecedented level of investment in sustainable transport, as well as supports for electrification, along with increased use of alternative sustainable fuels in transport.  The EPA Provisional Greenhouse Gas Emissions Inventory Report 2024 shows that 2023 transport emissions only increased marginally by 0.3% on 2022 data, with emissions now 4.3% below 2019 pre-Covid levels. During the same time, our economy grew by 5% (GNI) pointing to a decoupling between economic growth and transport emissions.  The decarbonisation pathway is naturally skewed to deliver the greatest share of emissions abatement in the second half of this decade as electrification efforts increase and major public transport infrastructure and services continue to be rolled out. Sustainable transport initiatives, including the uptake of electric buses will enable the transport sector to meet its carbon emission reduction targets, as set out under the Climate Action Plan.  Continuing to invest in our public transport infrastructure and services is vital to ensure that we enable modal shift from private vehicles towards more sustainable transport modes. Ongoing investment also has an important role to play in reducing the emissions of our public transport fleets as we move away from diesel fuelled vehicles towards electrified fleets. The full transition to a zero-emission urban bus fleet is expected to be completed by 2035, as non-zero-emission buses reach the end of their service lives and are replaced by zero-emission vehicles.  BusConnects is an example of a major investment programme which will enable the electrification of the bus fleets in our cities. The first order of 100 double-deck electric buses for the Dublin network was placed in 2022 and so far 94 of these buses have entered service. An additional 50 buses have been accepted by the National Transport Authority, and a further 70 have been ordered. Earlier this year 34 double-deck electric buses entered service in Limerick while Athlone became the first all-electric town bus service in Ireland in 2023. BusConnects also provides for continued investment in charging infrastructure at depots to support the further roll-out of an electrified bus fleet.  There have been other sustainable transport initiatives under the Climate Action plan to meet Ireland’s carbon emission reduction targets and I’m pleased to say we reported a positive 75% delivery rate for Q3 actions which included the following completed actions:  • An annual National Sustainable Mobility Policy Year Two Progress Report - www.gov.ie/en/publication/21cc7-national-sustainable-mobility-policy-year-two-progress-report/ - was published which outlines progress in delivering the Sustainable Mobility Policy (SMP) Leadership Group work programme, including oversight and delivery of the SMP Action Plan and Progression of the SMP Pathfinder Programme.  • Kick-off of a pilot integration project for school and public transport in the Limerick/Shannon/Ennis corridor commenced and has post-primary pupils going to/from schools using ‘open’ public transport (PSO) services for the first time rather than the ‘closed’ School Transport Service (STS).  • In terms of decarbonising the freight sector, following consultation with stakeholders the Department of Transport accepted a set of standards for the delivery of eco-driving courses in September. Further work will now commence to analyse what incentives and measures could be introduced to increase the number of drivers undertaking available courses.  My Department expects more positive output in the sustainable transport and electrification space going into Q4 with actions such as the targeted delivery of 110km of walking/cycling infrastructure, and the launch of electric bike trials in Limerick and Cork, due for delivery by the end of this year.

        "answerText": " Minister for Finance  The Deputy may be aware that prior to 1 January 2023, where the combined contributions by an employer and an employee to the employee’s Personal Retirement Savings Account (PRSA) did not exceed the employee’s annual percentage limit (between 15% and 40% of “net relevant earnings”, varying depending on age, up to a maximum relieved salary of €115,000) the contributions were relieved from tax. However, where the combined contributions exceeded the applicable threshold, the amount above the threshold was treated as a taxable benefit in kind (BIK) in the hands of the employee.  Section 22 of Finance Act 2022 removed the difference in treatment between PRSAs and occupational pension schemes. The amendment abolished the Benefit in Kind (BIK) charge on employer contributions to an employee’s PRSA. In addition, employer contributions to an employee’s PRSA no longer counted towards an employee’s age and salary related percentage limits on tax deductible contributions.  As with any change in tax policy, Revenue has actively monitored developments since the introduction of these changes in Finance Act 2022. The examination of employer contributions to PRSAs in 2023 identified a number of cases that give rise to concerns. Revenue data shows that in these cases, the employer contributions to PRSAs were significantly higher that the salary associated with the employment and, in most of these cases, the employee for whom the contribution was made had a connection to the employer (for example, the company owner or a family member of the owner). Following consideration of the data, it would appear these cases are giving rise to behaviour that is not in keeping with the policy intention of the changes made in Finance Act 2022.  Section 12 of Finance Bill 2024 aims to address these concerns. If enacted by the Oireachtas, the measure will provide for an “employer limit” on employer PRSA contributions of 100% of the relevant employee’s salary. Any contributions above the “employer limit” will be considered a BIK for the employee and therefore subject to tax. Where an employee’s salary in a particular year is lower than in the previous year because of unpaid leave such as maternity leave, parental leave or extended sick leave, the limit will be 100% of the employee’s emoluments for the previous year of assessment. In addition, an employer will only be able to take a deduction for Corporation Tax purposes for PRSA contributions for an employee up to the “employer limit”.  While addressing the concerns raised by Revenue I am also cognisant of ensuring a balance and not returning to the overly restrictive limits on employer contributions to PRSAs. The introduction of a 100% of salary limit achieves this balance.  Employers currently get full tax deductibility against their profits for pension contributions on behalf of their employees and there is currently no upper limit on tax relief for employer contributions. Following enactment of Finance Bill 2024, tax deductibility for employer contributions to PRSAs will only be allowed up to the “employer limit”.  An individual’s overall pension savings (including any employer contributions and including the individual’s aggregate pension savings in all products) is subject to an overall tax relieved limit, known as the Standard Fund Threshold (SFT), which is currently €2 million. ",

Deputy Noel Grealish asked the Minister for Finance the rationale to cap the maximum employer contribution of a PRSA to 100% of an individual’s salary in the year of payment from 1 January 2025; if there was significant evidence of abuse of the previous structure where annual contributions from employers were only limited by the SF; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

The Croí Cónaithe (Cities) Scheme supports the building of apartments for sale to owner-occupiers. The Scheme aims to bridge the current viability gap between the cost of building apartments and the market sale price (where the cost of building is greater).  To date, I have approved the Housing Agency entering into agreements in respect of six proposals for the delivery of 640 units under the Croí Cónaithe Cities Scheme. It should be noted that developments typically take between 18 months and 2 years to complete, so these units are expected to be delivered in 2025 and in 2026.  A third call for Expressions of Interest proposals under the scheme was recently conducted and the Housing Agency are presently assessing the applications. 20 eligible applications have been received with the potential to deliver more than 3,200 units.  The STAR Scheme is intended to bring forward Cost Rental Units at scale and at rents which are more affordable, with the aim of assisting eligible households in the private rental sector, particularly in urban centres where prevailing rents are especially high. 39 applications have been received to date, with the potential to deliver over 4,700 units.  I have approved the Housing Agency entering into Cost Rental Investment and Equity Participation Agreements in respect of six applications to date, for the provision of 1,036 units in total. 426 of these units were delivered in 2023, with the remaining 610 units being delivered this year.  Two further STAR proposals, with the potential to deliver almost 400 units across 2024 and 2025, are currently at the final stage of assessment.  The Land Development Agency (LDA) was established with a focus on managing the State’s lands to develop new homes and regenerate underutilised sites. It has also been tasked with unlocking stalled, private, planning-consented developments in the shorter-term through Project Tosaigh, its market engagement initiative.  The LDA is targeting 8,000 new homes over the course of the Project Tosaigh initiative. They are currently on track to deliver 5,000 new homes for social housing, Cost Rental and Affordable Purchase to eligible households by end 2026. In excess of 2,500 social, affordable purchase or cost rental homes are already either delivered, contracted or approved to proceed within the LDA to date under Project Tosaigh's first phase.  To deliver the next phase of Project Tosaigh, a framework panel consisting of 15 of Ireland’s largest and most experienced home-builders to accelerate the delivery of affordable homes was announced on 12 June 2024. It is anticipated that the first projects from this framework panel will be agreed in the coming months ",

At the heart of this policy is the principle that every community has the right to be and feel safe in order to thrive and flourish.  Our approach to community safety is a whole-of-government one. We want to bring the relevant social service providers, including the Gardaí, together with the community in a collaborative manner, by focusing on the concerns identified by the local community itself.  Local Community Safety  Partnerships (LCSPs) will operate at local authority level will replace and build upon the work of Joint Policing Committees (JPCs). The LCSPs will have a wider membership than JPCs and will include residents, local councillors, community representatives (including representatives of young people, older people, new and minority communities), business and education representatives and a range of public services including the HSE, Tusla, An Garda Síochána and the local authority.  Each newly established LCSP will be required to develop and implement its own tailored community safety plan and will take a strategic approach to their work so that issues arising can be dealt with in a coordinated manner; addressed collectively by relevant service providers in partnership with the community.  The role of the chairperson will be to lead the work of the LCSP and find consensus among the partnership's members so that a tailored local community safety plan can be developed. The chairperson will also drive forward the implementation of the community safety plan across the community, in order that it delivers tangible benefits for the relevant community.  The learnings from an independent evaluation of LCSP pilots delivered in three areas -  Dublin’s North Inner City, Longford and Waterford - concluded that the role of the chairperson, particularly in terms of leadership competence and experience, is central to the success of the Partnership.  The chairperson will:  • Provide leadership and strategic direction,  • Focus the LCSP on making informed decisions and solutions tailored to the needs of the specific community within which they are working,  • Develop and implement the local community safety plan in conjunction with both the community and public services, and  • Act as an advocate for the LCSP and represent the LCSP to the public, media and other stakeholders as appropriate.  While each LCSP and chairperson will be supported by a paid coordinator and a paid administrator funded by the Department of Justice, the role of the chairperson itself is a high-level volunteering role.  I have recently announced the appointment of chairpersons to the first seven Local Community Safety Partnerships being established across the country.  Further local authorities, including Galway City Council, have now finalised their recruitment process and recommendations are being received by my office. I hope to announce the appointment of further chairs in the coming weeks and at that point I expect to be in a position to announce the details of the nominees for Galway City Council and other local authorities.

Section 3(3) of the 1995 Act provides that the Board shall, subject to the provisions of the Act, be independent in the exercise of its functions.  I can advise the Deputy that the funding allocation to the Legal Aid Board for 2024 was approximately €59.1m, which was 11.4 % increase from the 2023 budget of €53.060m.  There was a further 8.5% increase in the recent budget allocation for the Legal Aid Board for 2025, with an allocation of €64.122m for the year.  Given the statutory independence of the Board, it is a matter for the Board and its management team to allocate their allotted funding as they deem appropriate.  Officials from my Department are in regular contact with the management team in the Legal Aid Board and have ongoing interaction with the Board, including on the question of resourcing, through the mechanisms of biannual governance meetings, an ongoing Oversight Agreement and an annual Performance Delivery Agreement.

        "answerText": " Minister for Finance  On the introduction of the Local Property Tax (LPT), the Government decided that a liability to the tax should apply to all owners of residential properties with a limited number of exemptions. Limiting the exemptions available allows the rate to be kept low for those liable persons who do not qualify for an exemption. There is no specific exemption from the requirement to pay LPT for property owners on fixed pensions under the Finance (Local Property Tax) Act 2012 (as amended), though such persons may be entitled to an exemption on other grounds or may qualify for a deferral subject to meeting the qualifying conditions.  The LPT legislation provides for the possibility of deferring the charge to LPT in certain circumstances to assist individuals who may have difficulty paying the tax. A qualifying person may opt to defer, or partially defer, payment of the tax. Where a person qualifies for a full deferral then 100% of the liability can be deferred. Where a person qualifies for partial deferral, then 50% of the liability can be deferred. The balance of 50% of the tax must be paid. The deferred tax remains as a charge on the property and must be paid before a sale or transfer can be completed. Interest is charged at 3% per annum on the deferred amount.  The income thresholds were increased in 2022 and are €18,000 for a single person and €30,000 for a couple to qualify for a full deferral. The income limits to qualify for a partial deferral are €30,000 for a single person and €42,000 for a couple. It is also possible to apply for a deferral on the grounds of hardship if a person suffers an unexpected and unavoidable significant loss or expense as a result of which a person cannot pay their LPT liability without suffering financial hardship. Further information regarding the deferral of LPT is available on the Revenue website at: www.revenue.ie/en/property/local-property-tax/deferral-of-payment/index.aspx.  Any property owners experiencing financial difficulties can avail of a wide range of flexible payment options both in respect of 2024 liabilities and for any previous years where liabilities remain outstanding. The full range of payment options, which includes phased arrangements, are available to property owners on the Revenue website at: www.revenue.ie/en/property/local-property-tax/paying-your-lpt/index.aspx.  Finally, property owners experiencing difficulties in meeting their LPT obligations can contact Revenue through MyAccount at www.revenue.ie or by calling the LPT helpline (01) 7383626. ",

        "answerText": " Minister of State at the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage (Deputy Alan Dillon)  My Department provides Exchequer funding to local authorities under the Housing Adaptation Grants for Older People and People with a Disability scheme, to assist people in private houses to make their accommodation more suitable for their needs. The grants include the Housing Adaptation Grant for People with a Disability, the Mobility Aids Grant and the Housing Aid for Older People Grant, which are 80% funded by my Department, with a 20% contribution from the resources of the local authority. The detailed administration of the scheme including assessment, approval, prioritisation and budgetary apportionment is the responsibility of local authorities.  The Regulations underpinning the scheme state that the Minister may from time to time issue guidelines to housing authorities in relation to the level and nature of income to be disregarded for the purposes of the operation of the scheme. These guidelines are available on request from local authorities. A number of payments from the Department of Social Protection are disregarded for the purpose of the means test. Typically these payments are paid in respect of individuals who are either caring or financially supporting a third party, for example a child, a relative with an enduring impairment or a child in foster care. Specific payments related to basic needs such as fuel allowance etc. are also disregarded. These disregards are designed to ensure that the provision of financial assistance for living costs or care do not disadvantage an individual applying for grant assistance under the scheme. Payments such as Disability Allowance, Jobseekers Allowance/Benefit or Non-Contributory Pension are not disregarded as they are income subsidies paid directly to an individual, and are therefore assessed as income under the means test in line with the regulations. The applicant can identify the relevant disregards being applied for on the application form.  On the 26 September 2024, Minister O'Brien and I published the Report on the Review of the Housing Adaptation Grants for Older People and People with a Disability. Amongst the recommendations included in the Report are a proposed increase in the grant limits by over 30% and the income thresholds by 25% as well as number of other measures in relation to the means test.  The Report on the Review of the Housing Adaptation Grants for Older People and People with a Disability is available on my Department’s website at the following link: www.gov.ie/en/press-release/ef265-ministers-obrien-and-dillon-announce-reforms-following-review-of-the-housing-adaptation-grants/#:~:text=The%20planned%20proposed%20changes%20follow%20today’s  My Department is proceeding to implement the review recommendations through bringing forward a statutory instrument, for consideration and signature, with the aim of introducing a revised scheme together with updated guidelines for local authorities.

The plan is of strategic national importance and, in order to ensure compliance with relevant environmental directives, it was necessary to bring it through the various stages of the Strategic Environmental Assessment process. Furthermore, as all seven of the Western Lakes are designated Natura 2000 sites, it was also necessary to bring the plan through the appropriate assessment process, to ensure compliance with articles 6(3) and 6(4) of the European Habitats Directive.  Following a long public consultation process, this Plan was advanced through the required Strategic Environmental Assessment and Appropriate Assessment processes. My officials have been advised by IFI that it is intended to shortly bring the Plan to the IFI Board for its consideration. Following IFI Board approval, the Plan would subsequently be submitted to my Department. ",

I am satisfied that the steps being taken by agencies such as those referred to are appropriate.  The four steps are a commonly referred to as \" procedures that may be followed when certain plans and projects are assessed in terms of their potential adverse effects on sites in the Natura 2000 network\" .  The first of these steps is \"Stage 1. Screening for Appropriate Assessment\", a process that addresses and records the reasoning and conclusions in relation to the first two tests of Article 6(3) of the Habitats Directive, namely  • i) whether a plan or project is directly connected to or necessary for the management of the site, and  • ii) whether a plan or project, alone or in combination with other plans and projects, is likely to have significant effects on a Natura 2000 site in view of its conservation objectives.  If the potential effects of the proposals are deemed to be significant, potentially significant, or uncertain, or if the screening process becomes overly complicated, then the process must proceed to Stage 2 (Appropriate Assessment).  The process of screening is carried out by the competent authority. Agencies such as those referred to in the details supplied have published \"Screening determinations\" or \"conclusion statements\". Publishing such a determination after screening for Appropriate Assessment is a requirement of Regulation 42(18)(a) of the European Communities (Birds and Natural Habitats) Regulations 2011 (S.I.

Deputy Noel Grealish asked the Minister for Social Protection if the normal average rule for calculating a State pension (contributory) can be used when a person continues to work between 66 and 70 years or if the total contributions approach must be used; and if she will make a statement on the matter. [40076/24] ",
        "answerText": " Minister for Social Protection  Following on from the Pensions Commission's recommendations, a number of State pension reforms were enacted in the Social Welfare (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2023, which represent the biggest ever structural reform of the Irish State pension system.  Among these reforms was the introduction of a flexible State pension system for those turning 66 on or after the 1st January 2024.  Those who avail of the flexible pension option can, on reaching pensionable age (66), defer access to their State Pension (Contributory) up to the age of 70 and receive an actuarially adjusted higher rate of payment. A person can use the period between 66 and 70 years of age to build up additional entitlements and, if a person has less than 10 years PRSI reckonable paid contributions, they may be able to use this period to establish entitlement. Those who defer claiming their State Pension (Contributory) and continue to work, will have access to certain short-term contingency payments during the period of deferral.  A further reform introduced under the 2023 Act is the ten-year phased transition from the Yearly Average (YA) method of calculation of State Pension (Contributory) to the Total Contributions Approach (TCA) as the sole method of calculation.  TCA resolves many of the anomalies arising from the YA calculation model. The main anomaly within the YA calculation method is that it is possible for people to start paying social insurance later in their working life and yet qualify for a pension at maximum rate. Entitlement to a full pension can in some cases be achieved from as little as ten years of social insurance contributions. Another anomaly arises where a person has a gap in their social insurance contribution record, possibly from periods spent caring for family or travel, and qualifies for a lower pension entitlement than a person with the same number of social insurance contributions. This occurs as their Yearly Average is calculated over the person’s entire ‘working life’.  TCA is a fairer and more transparent method of calculating the contributory pension as it more closely reflects the social insurance contributions made by a person during their working life.  The ten-year transitional arrangements are to avoid a ‘cliff edge’ effect. The first year of phasing-out begins in January 2025. During this transition period, pension rates will be based on best of the TCA, or a combined rate based on mix of Yearly Average and TCA, with the proportion accounted for by Yearly Average reducing from 90% to zero over 10 years and the proportion accounted for by the TCA increasing commensurately. From 2034, all State Pension (Contributory) calculations will be through the TCA method only.  If a person chooses to defer their State Pension (Contributory), the rate will be calculated based on the methods of calculation in the year that they drawdown their State Pension (Contributory) and not the year they reach pensionable age. For example, If a person reaches pensionable age (66) in 2025 and decides to defer drawing their State Pension (Contributory) until age 67 in 2026, the rate of State Pension (Contributory) will be calculated using the methods of calculation applicable for 2026.  I trust this clarifies the matter for the Deputy. ",

Deputy Noel Grealish asked the Minister for the Environment, Climate and Communications if he is satisfied with the current perverse salmon angling regulations that compel anglers to return alive rod caught escaped farmed salmon in designated ‘catch and release’ fisheries, considering the huge escape of farmed salmon during August 2024 in Killary Harbour, County Galway, with escaped farmed salmon being detrimental to the integrity of special areas of conservation; and if he will make a statement on the matter. [39239/24] ",
        "answerText": " Minister for the Environment, Climate and Communications  Since becoming aware of the escape of farmed salmon in Killary Harbour, Inland Fisheries Ireland (IFI) has been monitoring for escaped farmed salmon and has alerted anglers and fishery owners throughout the region to be vigilant for the potential presence of farmed fish in rivers. IFI has also requested that all encounters with potential farmed salmon be reported.  In catch-and-release designated fisheries where suspected farmed fish have been reported to be present, IFI allocated authorised officers to patrol and liaise with anglers to enable any samples to be retained. However, verification of farmed salmon based only on visual inspection of the exterior of the fish can in some instances prove very difficult and full verification of the farm origin of a fish is only possible through more detailed investigation (scale reading, internal dissection, genetic analyses of tissue samples). This is due in large part to farmed salmon not having any clear visual external markers that distinguish them from wild salmon with a high degree of certainty.  If the harvest and retention of “suspected” farm salmon in catch-and-release fisheries was permitted, it would increase the likelihood that wild salmon may be culled in error and potentially undermines the protection and conservation of wild salmon, particularly on those catch-and-release fisheries which are not currently exceeding their conservation limits.

The NIS2 Directive is a revision of the NIS Directive, which is currently in force in the State via SI 360 of 2018 and represents a major step forward for cyber resilience in Europe and will enhance cyber risk management across the Union including generating significant improvements in our capacity to respond to major incidents and developing the information-sharing platforms which are proving effective to date.  Separately as part of a number of measures to develop the National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC), which is a Division within my Department, the Government agreed in 2021 to establish the NCSC on a statutory basis and provide for related matters including clarity around its mandate and role in general and in relation to other actors in the cyber area. Therefore, transposing of the NIS2 Directive and the additional statutory powers required for the NCSC has been taken forward as a single legislative instrument: The National Cyber Security Bill 2024.  To date, Government has approved the designation of the national competent authorities (NCAs) for each of the sectors set out in the Directive. The NCSC, as the lead national competent authority, has set up and chairs the NCA Forum. This role sees the NCSC acting as a central coordinator providing advice, guidance and support including development of regulatory framework and tools to assist the other competent authorities.  Government also gave approval for the drafting of the National Cyber Security Bill 2024. My Department is currently engaging with the Office of Parliamentary Council (OPC), the Attorney General’s Office and other relevant Government Departments and Agencies on the drafting of the Bill. In tandem my Department is engaging with the Committee on Transport and Communications on the pre legislative scrutiny of the Bill.  Neither I or my officials can pre-empt the outcome or the length of time the legislative process will take, that is a matter solely for the Oireachtas.  However, the ongoing engagement with industry, sectoral entities, and the public administration sector among others, which is being led by the NCSC, will continue throughout the the legislative process and beyond . This is recognised by myself and my Department as a significant pillar of work required to ensure the successful implementation of the legislation in the State ",

The Directive also aims to improve working conditions and regulate the use of algorithms by digital labour platforms. It will make the use of algorithms in human resources management more transparent, ensuring that automated systems are monitored by qualified staff, and that workers have the right to contest automated decisions. The Directive also imposes substantial limitations on the processing of personal data by these systems.  On 11th March 2024, Ministers at the Employment, Social Policy, Health and Consumer Affairs Council (EPSCO) confirmed the provisional agreement reached on 8 February 2024 between the Council’s presidency and the European Parliament’s negotiators on the Directive. Ireland supported the proposal for agreement.  The European Parliament voted to approve the final text of the Directive on the 17 September 2024. It is expected that the Directive will be published in the Official Journal in the coming months after approval by Council. The EU Presidency will keep EU Member States informed of progress.  After the formal steps of adoption have been completed, Member States will have two years to transpose the provisions of the Directive into national legislation.

The declared qualifications for engineering posts in the local government sector specify that a candidate must hold an honours degree (level 8 in the National Framework of Qualifications) in Engineering. The recruitment and filling of posts in the local authority sector is undertaken both by individual local authorities and the Public Appointments Service depending on the level and tenure of the post concerned. Section 160(1)(c) of the Local Government Act 2001 provides that a person is not to be appointed to any employment under a local authority for which qualifications are for the time being declared under section 160 unless he or she possesses those qualifications.  My Department undertakes reviews of declared qualifications as necessary and in April this year a Working Group was established for the purpose of reviewing the existing suite of engineering qualifications in the local government sector and to propose changes to those qualifications where necessary.  To date the Working Group has undertaken an in-depth analysis and review of the engineering qualifications through engagement with local authorities, key stakeholders and other interested parties.
