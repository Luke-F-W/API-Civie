        "answerText": " Minister for Children, Disability and Equality (Deputy Norma Foley)  The delivery of an effective, efficient Assessment of Need system is a priority for the Government. There has been intensive work by the Department of Children, Disability and Equality and the HSE to address delays in the provision of Assessments of Need.  Under the Disability Act, an Assessment of Need is an assessment process carried out by the HSE where a person is of the opinion that he/she may have a disability, for anyone born after 1st June 2002. It first establishes whether the person has a disability (as defined within the Act). It then identifies the health and education needs of the person with a disability and the services required to meet those needs.  It is important to note that children do not require an Assessment of Need to access health services, including Primary Care, Children’s Disability Network Teams or Mental Health Services.  However, demand for Assessments of Need has increased significantly in recent years, reflecting both the increase in population and the number of families exploring all options to access services for their child. The impact of this increased demand has contributed to there being over 18,000 applications overdue for completion nationwide at the end of September- a 42% increase on this time last year.  More positively, there has been continued improvement in the number of completed assessment of need reports. Over 4,500 reports were completed in the first nine months of this year – a 57% increase compared to the same period last year.  This improvement has bolstered by significant investment by the Department of Children, Disability and Equality in the Targeted Waitlist Initiative which focuses on those families waiting longest for Assessments of Need. Under this Initiative, the HSE procures clinical assessments from approved private providers. Over 6,300 clinical assessments have been commissioned from private providers since the Initiative started in June 2024. Budget 2026 provides for the continuation of this Initiative next year with €20 million provided for the delivery of some 6,000 clinical assessments.  Last week, Government announced a series of reforms to the Assessment of Need process which will make the process more effective and efficient for children and families. Over time, this should lead to a reduction in the waiting time to receive an assessment.  This reform includes changes to Part 2 of the Disability Act, 2005, which provides for Assessments of Need. The General Scheme of the Disability (Amendment) Bill 2025 which outlines these proposed changes was approved by Government on 9 December and will be published on the Department’s website shortly.  Any proposed legislative changes will not remove any rights for parents to apply for an Assessment of Need for their child, nor will they alter the statutory six-month timeline set out in the Disability Act.  Other aspects of the reform include:  • The development of statutory guidelines to ensure that AONs focus on identifying a child’s needs, engaging in more intensive assessments only where required to identify need. This should help reduce delays and allow therapists to spend more time delivering services.  • The establishment by the HSE of eleven new teams, initially, to support HSE assessment processes, including Assessments of Need. Each team will include a psychologist, a speech and language therapist, an occupational therapist, and an administrator, providing clinical guidance throughout the process.  The provision of an effective and efficient Assessment of Need system continues to be a priority for the Government. ",

        "answerText": " Minister for Children, Disability and Equality (Deputy Norma Foley)  Foster carers play a vital and valued role in the care of the most vulnerable children in our society. Foster care is the preferred option for children who cannot live with their family of origin, and foster carers provide a safe, secure and stable home environment for these vulnerable children and young people.  This Department has overseen record investment in foster carers, including a 21% increase to the foster care allowance over the past two years, resulting in the current weekly allowance for children in foster care of €400 per week for children aged under 12, and €425 per week for those over 12.  A double payment of the foster care allowance was paid to foster carers at the end of 2023 and this payment was repeated at the end of 2024. This was in recognition of the significant pressures placed on families in the context of high rates of inflation, and was in line with other similar payments, including a double payment of child benefit, which foster carers also received.  Additionally, in 2025 foster carers now receive a bonus payment at the start of each initial foster care placement. This payment aims to alleviate the substantial out-of-pocket expenses that can be incurred by foster carers during the initial period after a child is placed in their care.  A revised Mileage Payment Scheme for foster carers also came into effect in April 2025. This broadens the categories of journeys which may be considered eligible for payment under the Foster Care Travel Payments Scheme. Additionally, the cumulative weekly travel distance to qualify for these payments has been reduced from 300km to 250km.  The Programme for Government 2025 sets out the Government’s intention to provide further support for foster carers, including further increases to the foster care allowance and the new Initial Placement Payment, a commitment to examine pension provision for foster carers, and examine eligibility for the Back-to-School Clothing and Footwear Allowance.  In respect of the double payment to foster carers paid to foster carers last year, I can advise that this payment was made on a once-off basis as there was no intention for this payment to be made on a reoccurring annual basis. Although this payment will not be made to foster carers this year, I can assure the Deputy I fully intend to prioritise foster care and ensure that we build upon the suite of supports of which foster carers can avail.

        "answerText": " Minister for Children, Disability and Equality (Deputy Norma Foley)  While the State cannot mandate providers to participate in the scheme, Core Funding has been designed with maximum participation of providers in mind as reflected in the year-on-year growth of investment in the Scheme (rising from €259 million in year 1 to over €390 million in the current programme year 4). This represents an increase of over 50% in Core Funding in three years.  I was delighted to announce further investment in Core Funding in Budget 2026. The additional funding being made available will see the allocation for Core Funding in the next programme year which begins in September 2026 increase to almost €482 million. That is an additional €89 million on the current full year allocation, or a 23% increase.  The Budget 2026 allocation will facilitate:  • Natural capacity growth of 4.2% across the sector.  • Additional capacity growth created by the new Building Blocks grants.  • Support for providers in adhering to the fee management conditions including the continued fee freeze and reductions to the maximum fee caps in the 2026/2027 programme year.  • Support for improved pay for early years educators and school-age childcare practitioners with implementation of new 2025 Employment Regulation Orders, with further increases in pay to be supported through enhancement in year 5 of the scheme.  In addition to this increased allocation, participation in Core Funding unlocks additional supports for services to access, including:  • access to wider financial supports where a service is experiencing financial difficulty or has concerns about their viability;  • access to enhanced support for services caring for concentrated numbers of children facing disadvantage through Equal Start; and  • opportunities to apply for capital grants through this Department.  Participation in Core Funding is optional, but it remains open to all registered providers subject to their agreement to the terms and conditions of the Core Funding Agreement.  It is a matter for providers to decide whether they wish to sign up to Core Funding and thereby benefit from the significant financial supports it offers to providers and the certainty it gives to parents through the associated fee management measures.  I wish to remind the Deputy that uptake of Core Funding remains strong. The fourth year of Core Funding began on 1 September and as of 12 December there were 4,580 services signed up to Year 4 of Core Funding, a 5 per cent increase on this time last year. This is the highest number of Partner Services in Core Funding at any point since the scheme was launched in 2022 and the number continues to grow.  I am encouraged by this rate of participation: it shows that Core Funding is working as intended, and the vast majority of families will continue to benefit from the scheme’s fee management conditions.

        "answerText": " Minister for Transport  As Minister for Transport, I have responsibility for policy and overall funding in relation to public transport; however, I am not involved in the day-to-day operations of public transport. The National Transport Authority (NTA) has statutory responsibility for securing the provision of public passenger transport services nationally and for the scheduling and timetabling of these services in conjunction with the relevant transport operators.  BusConnects is a transformative programme of investment in the bus system, providing better bus services across our cities. It is the largest investment in the bus system in the history of the state and is managed by the NTA. The aim of the network is to improve the existing Transport for Ireland system through enhanced services with high frequency spines and new local, Orbital and Radial routes.  It is acknowledged that reliability has been a key concern during the initial rollout of Phase 7, with challenges primarily linked to traffic congestion on new city-centre alignments and driver availability. When implementing new phases of the BusConnects network, the NTA continuously monitors services, identifies any issues that arise, and puts in fixes where appropriate. In that context, and as the Deputy may be aware, the NTA have recently announced changes to certain route alignments for Phase 7, including routes 80, 23, and 24, following feedback from passengers and local representatives. These amendments reflect the NTA’s commitment to improving services in direct response to that input.  Notwithstanding this, I would like to reassure the Deputy that Government remains strongly committed to providing all citizens with reliable and realistic sustainable mobility options, and public transport plays a key role in the delivery of this goal. To support this objective, in Budget 2026, the Department of Transport secured €940 million of funding for Public Service Obligation (PSO) and TFI Local Link services (a significant 43% uplift, an increase from €658.4 million in 2025).  My Department will continue to work with the NTA to ensure the redesigned network delivers on its objectives and its performance is closely monitored.  In light of the NTA’s responsibility in this area, I have also forwarded the Deputy's question to the NTA for a detailed direct reply. Please advise my private office if you do not receive a response within ten working days. ",

        "answerText": " Minister for Education and Youth  Languages Connect – Ireland’s Strategy for Foreign Languages in Education 2017-2026 aims to increase and diversify the range of languages taught and learned. As set out in the accompanying Implementation Plan which was informed by a lengthy and detailed consultation process, four new leaving certificate curricular languages were introduced from September 2020 – Lithuanian, Mandarin Chinese, Polish and Portuguese. These new languages were examined for the first time in summer 2022.  The Department of Education and Youth welcomes the efforts of the Romanian government and communities in Ireland to support the maintenance of the Romanian language and acknowledges that where the home language is supported there are better academic outcomes, positive identity, the development of intercultural skills, more opportunities for the future, and children stay connected with their heritage and families, all of which are recognised as important for the well-being of children.  Romanian is included as a non-curricular Leaving Certificate examination in accordance with Article 149 of the Treaty of Nice which states that “ Community action shall be aimed at developing the European dimension in education, particularly through the teaching and dissemination of the languages of the Member States.\"     Romanian    2017    2018    2019    2020    2021    2022    2023    2024    2025      Leaving Certificate Sits    193    267    340    237    325    379    367    421    417     * Non-Curricular Romanian Leaving Certificate Examination Sits (SEC)  Having regard to Ireland's clearly articulated national response to the war in Ukraine, and the principles that have been developed for the school sector which are informed by that position, it is considered appropriate that Ukrainian as a non-curricular language for Leaving Certificate would be developed by the State Examinations Commission for the State examinations 2025. A total of 549 students received a grade.  The model for the non-curricular language examination papers is based on the First Foreign Language final written paper of the European Baccalaureate.  A follow on to the Languages Connect Strategy will be developed with work commencing in 2026.   Introduction of new Leaving Certificate subjects under Senior Cycle Redevelopment   Under the Senior Cycle Redevelopment Programme, announced in March 2022, two new Leaving Certificate subjects, Drama, Film and Theatre Studies (DFTS), and Climate Action and Sustainable Development (CASD) have been introduced a number of selected Phase One schools from September 2025.  The curricula for all existing Leaving Certificate subjects and modules are also being revised in five annual tranches from 2025-2029 There is currently no plan to introduce Romanian (or any other new language subject) as a curricular subject into Senior Cycle under the redevelopment programme.  Ukrainian was introduced as a non-curricular examinable Leaving Certificate language (the same status as Romanian) from summer 2025 and 549 students received a grade.  The actual development of a new or revised subject specification takes around two years; with associated Teacher Professional Learning (TPL) to commence in the academic year prior to teaching and learning commencing in schools. This means that the total time required to introduce a subject from the time its development commences until it is taught in schools is a minimum of three years.  In determining the new subjects to be introduced under the redevelopment programme, a number of relevant factors were taken into account. These included consideration of:  • subjects that were suggested by students, teachers and others during the NCCA’s Senior Cycle Review, which ran from 2016-2020  • anticipated level of interest  • capacity to develop and deliver new subjects in addition to the revision of existing curricula  • providing greater choice for students to better reflect their range of interests and support the development of a wider range of talents and skills. In this regard the extensive range of language subjects already provided on both a curricular and non-curricular basis was a specific dimension to the consideration. In addition to Irish and English, the current language provision amounts to 14 curricular languages and 15 non-curricular languages, representing 34% of all curricular subjects and 52% of examinable subjects overall.   Foreign Languages at Primary level   • A new Primary Languages Curriculum (PLC) was published in September 2025 for introduction in primary schools on a phased basis from September 2026. The new PLC includes Modern Foreign Languages as part of the primary curriculum for the first time.  • Schools will be able to select the language used in the context of their resources and demographic. The curriculum will incrementally build on children’s existing knowledge and awareness of language in 3rd and 4th class progressing to a language competence model in 5th and 6th class.  • Language upskilling for primary teachers is currently underway.  • In advance of implementation of the new PLC, ‘Say Yes to Languages’ a language sampler module for primary schools is being facilitated by Post Primary Languages Ireland (PPLI) on behalf of the department. Over 1,300 primary schools right across the country are participating in this ten-week module selecting 12 languages in 2025/26 including Romanian in two schools.  • PPLI have provided training to the participating teachers and tutors. They have also provided the schools with a range of exciting and engaging resources which are also available on-line on the languages connect website. languagesconnect.ie/primary/ Four schools implemented Say Yes to Languages using Romanian in 2024/25.  • There are a range of Romanian resources for all levels available on the PPLI website here: [ Romanian - PPLI ]   Current supports for the Romanian language   Post Primary Languages Ireland (PPLI) supports the provision of Romanian language classes to encourage more students to maintain and develop literacy in their home or heritage language, by means of financial support to schools to recruit a teacher of Romanian where a critical mass of Romanian-speaking students attends. In 2024/25, funding was provided to three post-primary schools in Dublin, enabling them to deliver classes to over 150 students, as well as to acquire relevant materials. These classes supported students in their preparation for the non-curricular Romanian Leaving Certificate examination.  PPLI also provide support classes in Dublin on Saturdays with students of Romanian heritage taking the non-curricular language. 132 students were enrolled in these classes for the academic year 2024/25 and 111 in 2025/26.  PPLI are also working on the development of resources to support the teaching and learning of Romanian. In 2023 PPLI devised a Romanian language mat and Romanian Z-fold for use in the classroom to encourage communication in the target language. PPLI have also published a TY Beginners’ Module for Romanian.  A toolkit for acquiring foreign language books was developed as a collaboration between PPLI, Dublin City Libraries and Cabra Library and is now available to library branches nationwide. A foreign language category was introduced in the MS Readathon. A School Library Home Languages Funding Scheme facilitated by PPLI has provided 1385 schools (937 primary and 448 post-primary) with reimbursement for acquired materials in 80 different languages. Over 800 book titles in 27 languages have been provided to the JCSP Digital Library. All of the aforementioned include books and resources in the Romanian language. ",

      "question": {
        "answerText": " Deputy Jen Cummins  I wish to ask about the report on the Department’s forward planning for special education places in 2026-27. When I wrote this question, it was mostly to do with the portal at that time. I am now even more concerned since the announcement in relation to assessment of need by the Minister for children. I am just wondering about those two things. I know I got a letter from the Minister of State earlier this week or late last week with regard to the portal. I am concerned, however, because you still cannot log on and no parent is able to access it. I just want to see how this is going to be done. I know the question echoes previous questions, but I ask it in light of the new assessment of need situation. I thank the Minister of State very much. \n Deputy Michael Moynihan  Budget 2026 provides funding for 3,000 new special educational places within our education system for the 2026-27 school year. As the number of special classes and special schools continues to grow, there is also additional capacity created each year through the natural movement of children from primary to post-primary, leaving post-primary and with vacancies in individual classes.  In order to ensure new special classes can open as quickly as possible, the National Council for Special Education and the Department of education are prioritising working with medium and large primary schools that do not already have a special class and have available accommodation or a building to accommodate a new special class, as well post-primary schools with no special class or just one. This approach maximises the use of existing space that can be established and made to conform quickly and efficiently, while also ensuring new provision continues to be established. It also increases the number of schools with special classes, providing parents with greater choice and reducing the distances some students are travelling to access a special class place.  The Department and the NCSE have also had significant engagement with school patron bodies and school management bodies as part of the forward planning. The NCSE is undertaking analysis of the information provided through the parents notification process, which closed on 1 October, to plot the demand for special class places for 2026-27. The NCSE will also consider vacant places in existing special classes and places that will become available through the regular transition of students through the system. Once this analysis is completed, the NCSE will be equipped to engage with schools to open new special classes in relevant areas.  The NCSE expects to start sanctioning new special classes for the 2026-27 school year this week.  This is four months earlier than last year and will bring clarity to parents and schools as to where classes will be located.  I will come back to some of the other points the Deputy made in my follow-up response. \n Deputy Jen Cummins  My concern is that when the portal closed on 1 October, parents were no longer able to apply. Was that a way of saying that, for example, 600 parents applied for their children through the portal and we were able to provide those places? The vacant places that the Minister of State talks about, and I have raised this previously, are phantom places because if there are children at home without an appropriate school place, it does not matter how many vacant places we have. If they are not appropriate, they are a waste of space and a waste for a child.  I am also concerned about the issue of assessment of need. If we are taking away the need for an assessment of need to gain a special educational place but there will be an educational aspect to it, who is going to do that? Are they going to be qualified to do it? If a child rocks up to a school in September, how will the school forward plan for the needs of that child? How do we make sure that the school is the appropriate school for that child? I am really concerned that we have not got a handle on that. We are now entering into a new phase in terms of how we allocate places when we have not managed the phase we are currently in. \n Deputy Michael Moynihan  We have developed an extremely convoluted system of getting appropriate school places for children. That system was developed over many years and it causes frustration for families, children and school communities.  I will deal with the 1 October deadline first. The deadline was brought back from 1 February to 1 October to get a better handle on the system and to understand the level of need earlier in the school year. We will be sanctioning classes in the next couple of days, which is four months earlier than last year. That will be rolled out over quarter 1 of 2026, which will give greater certainty.  In terms of the assessment of need, it is a key component. We have constantly said that parents do not have to have an assessment of need to access special education but we have to bring clarity to that. Departmental officials and the education partners are meeting today in relation to this and their work will be ongoing because we need to bring absolute clarity as to who is making the decisions. The NCSE will be critically involved in this. We need to clarify who is going to support the school communities because if we do not get this process correct, we will not get the goodwill and buy-in from education partners, which is the crucial piece. We need buy-in from parents, teachers and school communities and, most importantly, good outcomes for the children. \n Deputy Jen Cummins  The plan is that the Department will allocate places over the next few days. If it then realises that there is further capacity, is the Department going to reopen the portal so that all of those late applications will be able to be considered as well? We are in one process currently, but an announcement has just been made that will affect the school year after next. It is important not to confuse the two issues because there is huge confusion and fear out there with regard to that. Will the Department be able to open up the portal again so that it can have a true vision of what is actually needed? If an assessment of need is no longer needed, how will schools know what needs a child has? \n Deputy Michael Moynihan  Families have been contacting the NCSE after 1 October, even though the portal is closed. They have contacted their local SENOs and the NCSE informing them that their children will need specialised places in September 2026, either in a special class in a special school or supported within a mainstream school. We will work with all of those families. We are going to continue to work with them and nobody will be forgotten within the system----- \n Deputy Jen Cummins  How? \n Deputy Michael Moynihan  Since 1 October, quite a number of families have contacted the NCSE----- \n Deputy Jen Cummins  They are being turned away. I am sorry to speak over the Minister of State, but they are being turned away. \n Deputy Michael Moynihan  -----through their SENO or directly. They have made contact through the local SENO, which is hugely important. They have contacted us and we are looking at those figures. We have brought the deadline forward to 1 October this year. We have to have a deadline because if we do not have one into the future, and if we constantly break that deadline, it will not work. We need to be sure of the numbers earlier within the system so that we can properly plan and make decisions and families can know with certainty early in quarter 1 of the year. ",

        "answerText": " Deputy Jen Cummins  What plans are there to ensure universities have up-to-date and working equipment for the sciences? We discussed this issue following Science Week. I would like to know how universities can be fully funded to ensure they have the most up-to-date equipment. We need our researchers to be working with equipment that is fit for purpose and fit for the future, particularly in the sciences. \n Deputy James Lawless  This is a timely question. On 26 November, I launched the new INSPIRE research infrastructure programme, which provides €750 million for capital investment in research infrastructure across the State and all our HEIs. It is a landmark moment for Ireland's national research and innovation system. As I am sure the Deputy has done, I have met with various stakeholders from the higher education system, including deans of research and presidents, and members of the research community, including PhD researchers and students, as well as industry representatives and employers, who ultimately will seek to take up the ideas that emerge from research and employ the skilled graduates who flow from the institutions.  INSPIRE will commence early in the new year. It has already been launched and the capital has been secured through the national development plan. It is a successor to the programme for research in third level institutions, PRTLI, which ran in the first decade of the century and was pivotal in sowing the seeds for the very strong research and innovation ecosystem that was built upon it. It withered on the vine to an extent over the past decade or so, having not been renewed since 2010 or 2011. My party promised a new initiative in this area in our manifesto and it was included in the programme for Government. I was particularly pleased to deliver it in our first year in office.  Under the overall NDP capital envelope, there is some €4.55 billion for my Department, €2.45 billion of which is being allocated to research and innovation of different hues. The INSPIRE programme has a number of different layers, one of which is to refresh equipment, systems and facilities across the HEIs. That will give them the base layer of equipment they need to perform world-leading, excellent and impactful research. There is another layer for very large-ticket items that are particularly expensive and complex and which one institution may struggle to purchase and manage on its own. The intention is to have a shared infrastructure portal whereby larger items like supercomputers and wire banks can be purchased by one institution and made available to all that want to avail of it. We will have a national management system for that. \n Deputy Jen Cummins  I am interested to see how that shared portal will work. I understand a lot of this equipment is incredibly expensive but, I assume, very important to have. I would like to hear more about how that will be managed.  Are we ensuring our PhD and postdoctoral researchers are being fully supported to be able to work in this area? I refer specifically to those who receive stipends and I am asking whether they are adequate.  There is a second element to my question. The Minister recently announced that the rent pressure zones, RPZs, will not apply to private student accommodation. I am very concerned that we will put all this equipment into universities but, at the same time, raise student accommodation prices twice in the next couple of years, out of line with what is happening in the rest of the country. I am concerned we will invest in this, which we should, but then we will not have he students or researchers coming in because student accommodation is unaffordable. I am delighted the Minister is able to put this amount of money into higher education but I am concerned that we will get all the equipment and then we may not have the students because accommodation is so expensive, particularly in urban areas. \n Deputy James Lawless  I understand the points the Deputy raised. I will be addressing student accommodation in the response to a later question, so I will not duplicate that now. The framework on which the INSPIRE programme is built was developed in collaboration with the sector. In March of this year, I put together an expert working group made up of people from the Irish Universities Association, people with experience of the PRTLI programme and expert academics. We very much looked to the sector to see what it needed and to seek its inputs, suggestions and guidance as to what was missing and what needed to be taken into the next stage. I had some knowledge of that from previous engagements but I wanted to formally engage as part of the exercise to put the programme in place. INSPIRE is very much based upon that expert guidance and it has been very warmly welcomed by the sector. Many of the presidents have been in touch with me directly and many of them attended the recent launch. It is great to be in a position now to be able to do this. \n Deputy Jen Cummins  Will the Minister explain how the sharing part will work? He said he will address student accommodation presently. I will have to step out of the Chamber but I will listen to what he says. All of these things are interlinked. When we are trying to make third level as accessible as possible, it is really important that all aspects are there to support learners but also the universities. It will put pressure on universities if all those aspects are not there. Is there a timeframe as to when the equipment will be in place? We are in the middle of an academic year and the stuff cannot be magicked out of nowhere. I am sure there are public procurement requirements and all of that. Will it be in place for the academic year of 2026-2027? \n Deputy James Lawless  The programme will be delivered in two phases and will be managed by the Higher Education Authority in the first phase and by Research Ireland in the second. The first phase will establish a strategic baseline across the sector such that all investments are grounded in a systematic alignment with the particular university or HEI. It is a competitive fund and not a case of there being one for everyone in the audience. Funding will be awarded based upon excellence and impact, in alignment with the university. Universities are encouraged to put together their own proposals and they will be considered by an expert panel. That panel will be entirely independent and I will not have an involvement in it. The proposals will be peer-reviewed by expert academics who probably will be external to the country.  That is how it was done in PRTLI before and it is best practice internationally.  In terms of the shared infrastructure, the way it is envisaged to work is this. They are large items with a minimum €500,000 price tag; some may be multiples of that, depending on the item. Again, it would be a competitive call. All universities, effectively, would be invited in to put forward their proposals. There would be a competitive process that would then go into a central portal, which other universities can share it from. ",

        "answerText": " Minister for Education and Youth  Since 2020, my department has invested over €6 billion in our schools throughout the country under the National Development Plan, involving the completion of over 1,300 school building projects. Over €52m has been invested in school in Dublin South Central in that period. This investment has supported the completion of 12 school building projects. Currently 7 projects are in construction.  In July the Government announced a capital allocation of €7.55 billion for the Department of Education and Youth for the period 2026-2030 under the National Development Plan. As part of this NDP allocation my department will place a strong emphasis on provision for children with special educational needs, with a particular focus on meeting annual school place needs.  In relation to project rollout for Large-Scale projects and Additional School Accommodation scheme projects, the approach will be to continue to maximise the capacity of the existing school estate as much as possible in the first instance and provide necessary additional capacity through targeted and prioritised project rollout over the course of 2026 to 2030 period to meet the most urgent and prioritised needs.  The NDP Implementation Plan for the Education and Youth sector will be published next week and the first tranche of projects to progress to construction will be published in January.  The current status of all projects is set out on my department’s website at www.gov.ie. This is updated on a regular basis to reflect project progress through the various stages of capital appraisal, site acquisition, design, tender and construction. ",

        "answerText": " Minister of State at the Department of Education and Youth  The National Council for Special Education (NCSE) is the statutory agency with responsibility for the provision of special education places.  The NCSE sanctioned 407 new special classes for the 2025/26 school year bringing to 3,742 the number of special classes in our schools.  Combined with 300 new special school places this brings to 2,700 the number of new school places for children with special educational needs. This additional capacity, together with the movement of children across existing classes, means that my department and NCSE has created more capacity than children made known to the NCSE through the Parent’s Notify process.  In addition, the NCSE has worked closely with families who came forward post the Parent’s Notify deadline in February to support them through a range of measures.  For the 2026/27 school year the NCSE is undertaking an analysis of the information provided through the Parents Notify process which closed on 1 October to plot demand for specialist places for the new school year.  The NCSE will have a clear picture of the local demand for special class places for the 2026/27 school year after they review and assess all of the information which has been provided through the parents' notification process. The NCSE report a very significant level of engagement and contact from families.  The NCSE advise that the majority of children and young people coming to them through the Parent’s Notify process are already enrolled in school and are being supported by existing special education teachers and special needs assistants.  My department and the NCSE are committed to ensuring that sufficient special education placements remain available for students with special educational needs and will continue to review and monitor the situation as to where new specialist provision is required.  An exercise conducted by the NCSE at the start of this school year confirmed a number of vacant special class places across the country. ",

Under the Short-Term Activation Programme, the initial target was to deliver circa 1,000 additional student beds. Following due diligence and value-for-money assessments, the revised total now stands at 967 beds that have either been delivered or are progressing. Maynooth University has successfully completed its 116-bed project. University College Dublin is advancing its 493-bed development, with approval to proceed to construction given in September 2025. Trinity College Dublin’s 358-bed project is progressing to the tender stage this year. These developments will provide additional capacity in the short term. The Dublin City University 405-bed project will not be progressed at this time, reflecting cost and value-for-money considerations. In parallel, the Technological Sector Student Accommodation Programme, or TSSAP, is supporting technological universities to expand student accommodation. Phase 1, completed in 2025, generated 53 strategic proposals for future developments, while Phase 2, starting in early 2026, will develop preliminary business cases, including financial and operational models. This will ensure that future projects are strategically aligned, financially viable, and responsive to local demand.I will publish the new Student Accommodation Strategy 2025–2035 in the coming days. It will prioritise increasing supply and improving affordability for students facing the greatest financial challenges.The Strategy will provide a clear framework to expand provision nationwide and ensure student housing is sustainable, accessible, and responsive to need over the next decade. It will separately address affordability through supports such as Student Universal Support Ireland (SUSI) and targeted bursaries, and viability through private investment and state support to deliver high-quality, purpose-built accommodation at scale.

        "answerText": " Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage  The Housing (Traveller Accommodation) Act 1998 provides that the role of my Department is to ensure that there are adequate structures and supports in place to assist housing authorities in providing accommodation for Travellers, including a national framework of policy, legislation and funding.  The Act provides that housing authorities have statutory responsibility for the assessment of the accommodation needs of Travellers and the preparation, adoption and implementation of multi-annual Traveller Accommodation Programmes (TAPs) in their areas.  My Department ceased the practice of allocating specific budgets to individual local authorities following a review of arrangements for the disbursement of funding provision and related supports for Traveller-specific accommodation. Since 2020, it is open to all local authorities to apply for and drawdown funds at any time throughout the year and this is actively encouraged by my Department.  Full spend of the Traveller accommodation capital budget has been achieved for the past 5 years from 2020 to 2024, amounting to €14.6m in 2020, €15.5m in 2021, €21.1m in 2022, €29.8m in 2023 and €21m in 2024. In 2025, the budget allocation for capital funding is €23 million and current funding is €7 million.  My Department is committed to supporting Dublin City Council in the redevelopment of Labre Park. In April 2016, a Stage 1 application for the redevelopment of this site was submitted to my Department, and in September 2016, my Department granted approval for a budget provision of €8.7 million. In July 2019, a Stage 2 application was received by my Department and approval was granted subsequently for funding of €13.2 million.  In December 2022, a revised Stage 2 application was received by my Department. In February 2023, further information requested by my Department was submitted by the local authority and subsequently in July 2023 my Department granted approval for an increased overall budget provision of €16.7m for the redevelopment of Labre Park.  My Department provided this funding approval for the redevelopment of accommodation at Labre Park to support the long-term strategy for this site to provide quality accommodation to the residents which will address the current conditions on the site.  My Department met with Dublin City Council most recently in September 2025 to discuss the planned redesign and regeneration of Labre Park. Subsequently, in November 2025, Dublin City Council submitted a further revised Stage 2 application for funding to my Department and this is currently under consideration. ",

        "answerText": " Minister for Health  The Community Pharmacy Agreement 2025 was published on the 18th of September 2025, following the successful conclusion of negotiations with the Irish Pharmacy Union (IPU).  The Agreement marks a significant milestone in the strategic collaboration between the Department of Health, the Health Service Executive (HSE), and the IPU. It sets out a comprehensive and ongoing pathway to modernise and expand the role of community pharmacy in Ireland’s healthcare system.  The Agreement is available on the Department of Health’s website at the following link: www.gov.ie/en/department-of-health/publications/community-pharmacy-agreement-2025/.  It is important to note that the Community Pharmacy Agreement 2025 does not remove phased dispensing.  Phased dispensing was introduced in 1996 for patient safety reasons. The supply of medication in instalments can support patients prescribed certain high-risk medications who are at risk of medication misadventure if these medications were to be supplied monthly, as is the norm under the community drug schemes. Where a phased dispensing claim is submitted, the current requirement is that an item must be dispensed in the pharmacy across multiple supply occasions. Community pharmacies receive additional payments in respect of phased dispensing.  Monitored Dosing Systems (MDS) are systems that enable the individual medicine doses to be organised according to the prescribed dose schedule. These are sometimes referred to as blister packs or compliance aids.  Monitored Dosing Systems and phased dispensing are two separate processes. Phased dispensing requires the patient to present to the pharmacy on multiple occasions in the month, e.g. each week, for dispensing of medicines. Phased dispensing is in place where it is unsafe for the patient to have the totality of their medication in one supply occasion. Monitored Dosing Systems are ordinarily provided in one visit and packaged to indicate when medication should be taken. The State has never agreed to fund Monitored Dosing Systems.  However, a practice has built up whereby the use of Monitored Dosing Systems are charged as if for phased dispensing. The State has never agreed to this. Phased claiming was never intended to be used to submit claims in lieu of the provision of Monitored Dosing Systems.  Whilst Monitored Dosing Systems may have a role for some patients there is significant uncertainty around the robustness of the evidence supporting its use. The National Centre for Pharmacoeconomics carried out an evidence assessment which indicated that the evidence was, at best, equivocal to support such a programme.  Significant expenditure is therefore being incurred where it was never intended by the State. It has been agreed to introduce improved controls in this regard and to limit the use of phased dispensing to specified high risk drugs, where a patient safety concern may exist.  Phased dispensing support is currently available for medical card holders under the General Medical Services (GMS) Scheme for the following reasons:  Reason 1 - at the request of a patient's physician.  Reason 2 - due to the inherent nature of a medicinal product i.e. product stability and shelf life.  Reason 3 - where a patient is commencing new drug therapy with a view to establishing patient tolerance and acceptability before continuing on a full treatment regime.  Reason 4 - in exceptional circumstances where the patient is incapable of safely and effectively managing the medication regimen.  Under the Community Pharmacy Agreement 2025, from January 2026, phased dispensing under reason 1 and 4 will be limited to a defined set of high-risk medication classes. These are:  • Psychotropics;  • Opioids;  • Codeine; and  • Pregabalin and gabapentin.  The approved list of medications under these classes will be provided by the HSE in due course.  For reasons 1 and 4, by focusing phased dispensing reimbursement on the medication categories on the approved list, phased dispensing payments can be targeted to medications with the highest risk or potential for misuse.  Phased dispensing fees will remain payable as per current arrangements under reasons 2 and 3 and will not be subject to the approved list.  The salient point here is that appropriate phased dispensing is not being removed in this Agreement.  The introduction of improved controls around phased dispensing is being done in a way which puts patient safety first and allows the State to repurpose funding to be used to implement new patient-centred services.  It remains open to pharmacies to charge patients for the use of Monitored Dosing Systems as a private service.  The Agreement is designed to support the delivery of safe, equitable, and efficient healthcare, and to ensure that community pharmacists are better equipped to contribute to national health priorities through structured engagement, sustainable funding, and integrated service delivery.  Under the Agreement, a Strategic Collaboration Group will be established from early 2026 which will provide a structured forum for dialogue and joint consideration of strategic issues shaping the future of community pharmacy in Ireland.  The Agreement also includes the establishment of a rolling annual medicines optimisation programme with dedicated annual funding. The Strategic Collaboration Group will be tasked with exploring the best way to utilise this fund. ",

        "answerText": " Minister for Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science (Deputy James Lawless)  In general, for student grant purposes, students are categorised according to their circumstances either as students dependent on their parent(s) or legal guardian(s), or as independent mature students.  A student may be assessed as an independent student if  • they have attained the age of 23 on the 1st of January of the year of first entry or re-entry to an approved further education course or an approved higher education course and;  • have not been ordinarily resident with their parent(s) from the previous 1st October.  Otherwise, they are assessed as a dependent student i.e. assessed with reference to parental income.  Applicants who do not meet the criteria to be assessed as an independent student for grant purposes, or who cannot supply the necessary documentation to establish independent living for the required period, may still apply to the awarding authority SUSI to have their grant eligibility assessed as a dependent student.  Under Article 21(3) (b) of the Student Grant Scheme 2025, where compelling evidence of estrangement from parents/guardians has been provided, applicants who are under 23 can be assessed without reference to their parents/guardians income or address.  If an applicant is irreconcilably estranged from their parents or legal guardians they can declare this on their SUSI application. Such applications are reviewed on a case-by-case basis by a specialist assessment team who are dedicated to giving these applications the care and thorough consideration required around such a sensitive issue.  Applicants are requested to provide documentary evidence of estrangement to confirm their situation. The type of documentary evidence required is dependent on the applicant’s individual circumstances and may vary widely from case to case.  The requirement to provide sufficient evidence is necessary, due to the fact that, where estrangement is confirmed, applicants may be exempted from having their parent’s or legal guardian’s income taken into account for grant assessment purposes.  Any student experiencing difficult circumstances and issues obtaining relevant documentation for their SUSI application should contact the SUSI helpdesk for assistance.  If a student is dissatisfied with a decision in relation to a grant application they can appeal to a SUSI Appeals Officer. If they remain dissatisfied with the decision of the Appeals Officer, they can further appeal to the independent Student Grants Appeals within the statutory deadlines. ",

Planning for the Convention is ongoing, including the list of people and organisations who will be participating, and further information will be made available in due course.

This will include ensuring diversity of voice in the Convention, as well as ensuring representation is heard from the wide range of all those with a stake in our education system.  With this in mind, ahead of the Convention, we will be launching the first ever National Conversation on Education with school communities and national stakeholders. The National Conversation will allow all citizens and groups to get involved and have their say on the future of education, through surveys and submissions, school community engagements, and regional events. This Conversation will also include outreach to seldom-heard, marginalised voices.  The National conversation will inform what changes may be needed to the education landscape to help ensure responsiveness of the system to children and young people’s needs over the years and decades to come, to reflect on how best to provide for what is working well and to examine what needs to be changed.  The findings from the National Conversation will inform the agenda for the Convention, which in turn will be agreed by Government. The work of the Convention will then inform the development of a long-term education strategy. ",

The Bill, was referred to the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Justice, Home Affairs and Migration for pre-legislative scrutiny on 19 May, and on the 24 September the Committee published its report and made 30 recommendations. Drafting of this Bill is ongoing between the Department and the Office of Parliamentary Counsel and it is on the priority list for publication in this session.  The proposed legislation will deliver on the Programme for Government commitment to “examine proposals to remove guardianship rights from those convicted of killing their partners or a parent of their child”. It upholds a principle that those convicted of the most serious crimes should not retain automatic legal authority over the children they have left behind. The proposal to legislate is also part of ongoing work to implement appropriate recommendations from the Study on Familicide and Domestic and Family Violence Death Reviews.  The Bill seeks to address the particular situation where a guardian has been killed or incapacitated by another guardian of the child - the result may be that the convicted guardian is the only effective guardian of the child. This situation is distinct from situations where a guardian may have committed offences against another guardian, but that guardian is not killed or incapacitated as result. ",

In recent years, Government has introduced several schemes to help people to buy or rent homes, supported by Housing for All. Since 2021, close to 16,900 supports nationwide have been provided via these measures. Under Delivering Homes, Building Communities 2025 – 2030, these supports will be retained, streamlined and expanded to form a Starter Homes Programme to ensure that first time buyers and renters in need of support, are supported by Government.  Single adult households account for around two thirds of households on social housing waiting lists and this proportion is steadily increasing. Studios and one-bedroom apartments provide much needed housing options for these households. In addition to significantly increasing the supply of social homes, the new housing plan will deliver an appropriate mix of house types and sizes, which will ensure that the needs of all social housing qualified households can be met.  To this end, local authorities will be required to develop new Housing Delivery Action Plans (HDAP's), setting out details of both social and affordable housing delivery to 2030. The intent is that these HDAP's will include information relating to the number of one bed homes each local authority intends to deliver, in line with local need. ",

        "answerText": " Minister of State at the Department of Education and Youth  The School Transport Scheme is a significant operation managed by Bus Éireann on behalf of the Department of Education and Youth.  The scheme is made up of three separate schemes, the school transport scheme for primary, post primary and for children with special educational needs.  Transport is also provided for children who have arrived in Ireland from Ukraine and those residing in IPAS/EROC centres.  The purpose of my Department's School Transport Scheme is, having regard to available resources, to support the transport to and from school of children who reside remote from their nearest school.  Under the terms of the School Transport Schemes, children are eligible for transport at primary level where they reside not less than 3.2 kms from and are attending their nearest primary school. At post primary level, they are eligible where they reside not less than 4.8 kms from and are attending their nearest post primary school/education centre. Distance is determined by the Department/Bus Éireann and rules have regard to ethos and language.  Parents of children wishing to avail of school transport services are required to apply on-line to Bus Éireann’s website at buseireann.ie/schooltransport  Families may still apply for school transport after the closing date, but if the application or payment is late they may not secure a seat on a service and will not be considered for a remote area grant.  A minimum number of 10 eligible children residing in a distinct locality, as determined by Bus Éireann, are required before consideration may be given to the establishment or retention of school transport services, provided this can be done within reasonable cost limits.  Children who are eligible for school transport and who complete the application process on time (apply on time and pay on time) are accommodated on school transport services where such services are in operation and where there is capacity to do so.  Children who are not eligible but who apply for school transport are considered for spare seats that may exist after eligible children have been facilitated; such seats are referred to as concessionary seats.  Because of the nature of concessionary transport for non-eligible children and the priority of providing places for eligible children, there may be an excess of demand over supply for concessionary places. In these cases Bus Éireann will allocate tickets for spare seats using an agreed selection process.  Temporary Alleviation Measures (TAMS) at post primary level are continuing for the current school year. Under these measures, transport will be provided where there is a route in operation and where capacity exists for concessionary post primary pupils who are eligible for transport to their nearest school, are attending their second nearest school and who applied and paid on time.  Bus Éireann have advised that 449 pupils are travelling on mainstream services and 283 pupils are travelling on dedicated school transport services for children with special educational needs to schools in Newbridge. In addition, 5 mainstream pupils did not receive tickets for schools in Newbridge, due to late payments or the pupil not being eligible for school transport. ",

        "answerText": " Minister for Education and Youth  I can assure the Deputy that the provision of school places to meet the needs of children and young people at primary and post primary level, including children and young people with special educational needs is an absolute priority of mine.  The annual enrolment process for new Junior Infants at primary and new First Years at post-primary is a very large-scale operation that is transacted at close to 4,000 schools across the country, involving some 140,000 pupils. While my department is aware of enrolment pressures and demand for additional school places in some areas, it is important to note that enrolment pressures can be driven by duplications of applications, applications from outside an area, and school of choice factors. Notwithstanding the above, in some areas, demographic pressures and other factors are driving a requirement for additional school places.  Furthermore, the data sharing arrangements that were in place for the 2025/26 admissions process have been put in place again for the 2026/27 admissions process in school planning areas that are experiencing enrolment pressures, including Newbridge. The admissions data provided by schools will allow the department to analyse duplicate applications as there can be significant overlap in areas.  The Deputy will appreciate that there can often be significant overlap across areas and schools, and the nature of the admissions processes is quite complex. As a result, there can be multiple iterations, where applicants may accept a place but subsequently be offered and accept a place at a second school, freeing up capacity at the first school accepted. In that context, it may take some time for my department to fully review the availability of post-primary school places in Newbridge while the admissions process continues to progress.  My department's main responsibility is to ensure that schools in an area can, between them, cater for all pupils seeking school places in the area. In relation to school admissions, it is the responsibility of the managerial authorities of all schools to implement an enrolment policy in accordance with the Education Act, 1998.  Parents have the right to choose which school to apply to and where the school has places available the pupil should be admitted. However, in schools where there are more applicants than places available a selection process may be necessary. This selection process and the enrolment policy on which it is based must be non-discriminatory and must be applied fairly in respect of all applicants. However, this may result in some pupils not obtaining a place in the school of their first choice.  I can assure the Deputy that my department will continue to keep the school place requirements in Newbridge school planning area, as with other areas across the country, under review. ",
