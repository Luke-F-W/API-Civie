        "answerText": " Minister of State at the Department of Justice, Home Affairs and Migration  As the Deputy will be aware, last week Minister O'Callaghan and I announced a number of new policies and legislative changes to strengthen Ireland’s migration and asylum system.  I published the review of the non-EEA Family Reunification Policy, which has remained largely unchanged since 2013, and sets out how Irish citizens and most non-EEA Irish residents may apply to bring non-EEA family members to live with them in Ireland. The majority of these changes took immediate effect, with longer term measures to be introduced as soon as operational considerations allow.  I can advise the Deputy that the income requirements for healthcare workers on General Employment Permits remain unchanged. They must have a gross income in excess of €30,000 in the previous year to sponsor a spouse or partner, and a gross income in excess of €44,300 to sponsor one child. The income thresholds, as before, are indexed against the Working Family Payment (WFP) based on the number of children a sponsor wishes to bring. This means that the threshold to sponsor one child will rise to €50,200 in January 2026. For such applicants, the requirement to produce financial records has reduced from two years to one year, to align with the existing one year waiting period.  I can also confirm that the income of only one individual sponsor will be considered in assessing whether an application meets the financial requirements. Declared and verifiable savings by the family member or sponsor may also be taken into account in assessing cases that fall short of the income thresholds.  An important consideration in all family reunification applications is the ability of the sponsor to demonstrate a clear capacity to provide for their family members if they are to be granted a permission to come to Ireland. New conditions will also be introduced as soon as operational considerations allow to ensure sponsors have suitable private accommodation for their family before they arrive in Ireland.  The purpose of the revised Policy is not to deter people from integrating or making applications, but to ensure that people who are sponsoring an application have sufficient resources to provide for their family, without the reliance on state funds. The policy also aims to ensure that the needs and welfare of children are considered when determining the eligibility of a sponsor.  The revised policy can be accessed on my Departments website at the following link:  www.gov.ie/en/department-of-justice-home-affairs-and-migration/publications/revised-non-eea-family-reunification-policy-and-final-report-on-the-review-of-the-policy/.

        "answerText": " Minister of State at the Department of Justice, Home Affairs and Migration  The naturalisation application referred to by the Deputy continues to be processed by my Department.  I can advise the Deputy that this naturalisation application has been returned twice as it was incomplete and missing all the required documentation.  In cases where incomplete applications are received, the applicant is notified, and the application is returned with a request to provide the missing documentation within 28 days. A reminder notification is issued after 18 days if the required documentation has still not been provided.  When an application is returned, it is taken out of the queue for processing and will only rejoin the processing queue once the application has been updated and resubmitted by the applicant. It is important to note that the resubmitted application will rejoin the queue based on the date that it is resubmitted, not the date of the original application.  It is important to note that no two naturalisation applications are the same and some take longer than others to process. Given the importance of citizenship, robust and comprehensive checks must take place on each application. Unfortunately, some checks, including international checks, can take a considerable amount of time and are largely outside the control of the Immigration Service.  For that reason, while I expect that, going forward, most applicants will receive a decision within one year, this timeframe cannot be guaranteed in respect of applications made in any specific year.  Citizenship Division has taken a significant number of steps to improve the process for applicants. These include the introduction of an online digital application system, online payments, and eVetting. I am pleased to inform the Deputy that these measures are contributing to reduced processing times.  Applicants can now directly check the status of their immigration application on the Immigration Service’s Customer Service Portal. They can register for, or log in to their existing account, at: [ www.portal.irishimmigration.ie/en/ ]  As an Oireachtas member, you can also request the status of individual immigration cases by e-mail, using the Oireachtas Mail facility at: IMoireachtasmail@justice.ie, which has been specifically established for this purpose. This service enables up to date information on such cases to be obtained without the need to seek information by way of the Parliamentary Question process. ",

It currently offers income or corporation tax relief for qualifying expenditure incurred in the refurbishment and conversion of qualifying residential and commercial buildings located within ‘Special Regeneration Areas' (SRAs) of the cities of Cork, Dublin, Galway, Kilkenny, Limerick and Waterford.  The SRAs were designated following consultation with the relevant city councils and an independent review by a third party advisor. Specific criteria were set down in respect of the areas which should be included within the remit of the LCI which were required to be taken into account by the relevant city councils when putting forward the proposed SRAs for each city. The SRAs were designed to achieve the very specific objectives of the scheme and no more.  In the Budget 2026 address, it was announced that a number of enhancements to the LCI to strengthen the scheme would be included in Finance Bill 2025. The Bill was published on 16 October last and is currently progressing through the Houses of the Oireachtas. It was also announced that the LCI would be extended to the five regional centres identified in the National Planning Framework of Athlone, Drogheda, Dundalk, Letterkenny and Sligo. Work will commence shortly on the designation of SRAs in the five additional towns. ",

        "answerText": " Minister for Education and Youth  Tackling education disadvantage and helping students realise their full potential is a key priority for the Minister for Education and Youth. The DEIS programme is a key policy initiative to address concentrated educational disadvantage at school level.  Currently, the DEIS programme supports almost 1,200 primary and post-primary schools, reaching approximately 260,000 students, with an annual investment of over €180 million. Budget 2026 allocates an additional €16 millions in 2026, rising to €48 million in 2027, to support the implementation of the new DEIS Strategy and introduce the DEIS Plus scheme, which will commence in 2026.  The DEIS Plus scheme will provide additional support to schools with the highest levels of need, in line with the Government’s commitment. It will target a cohort of schools with high concentrations of children and young people experiencing intergenerational disadvantage where there is a significant gap in outcomes and there are barriers to those children and young people achieving their potential.  The process to identify schools for inclusion in DEIS Plus will be evidence-informed, using available data. The details of the DEIS Plus scheme are currently being finalised within an overall programme of work to tackle educational disadvantage and will be outlined in the new DEIS Strategy, which I intend to publish in early 2026. Any future expansion of the DEIS programme and inclusion in the DEIS Plus scheme will be considered with the context of the new DEIS Strategy and the availability of resources. ",

I strongly welcome the significant increase in funding for walking and cycling infrastructure projects in recent years. Approximately €290 million was provided to the NTA’s Active Travel Programme this year alone, supporting projects in every local authority. The NTA work with local authorities in identifying projects on an annual basis in the context of future funding allocations.  As the Deputy may be aware, BusConnects is a transformative programme of investment in the bus system, with the aim to provide better bus services across five cities. It is the largest investment in the bus system in the history of the State and is managed by the National Transport Authority (NTA).  In Dublin, the major infrastructure element of BusConnects comprises Core Bus Corridor schemes, which will also deliver improved cycling facilitates along their routes.  An Coimisiún Pleanála has approved all 12 Core Bus Corridor schemes, including the Tallaght-Clondalkin to City Centre Scheme, which encompasses the area referred to by the Deputy. Planning for the construction of the scheme is the responsibility of the NTA.

The Department is currently at an advanced stage in the development of a centralised reporting database. This will make information on employers’ gender pay gaps more accessible to the public and will help our understanding of the gender pay gap in Ireland and how it might be eliminated. The system will enable members of the public to search for and view individual employers’ returns on the database, both overall and by year, including browsing for returns. The public will also be able to compare employers across a range of variables.  The Department will open the portal on a voluntary basis in November 2025 to select employers who have received an invitation link from partner organisations the 30% Club and IBEC, and for Government Departments, their Agencies and State bodies under their aegis.

        "answerText": " Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage  The response to Domestic, Sexual and Gender-Based Violence (DSGBV) is a cross-Departmental and multi-agency issue, with overall policy coordinated by the Department of Justice. Responsibility for the development and provision of services to support victims rests with my colleague the Minister for Justice working in conjunction with Cuan, the statutory DSGBV agency under the remit of the Department of Justice.  In 2017, my Department issued policy and procedural guidance to local authorities relating to the role they can play to assist victims of domestic violence. The issuing of this 2017 policy and guidance was a significant action in the second national strategy on DSGBV 2016-2021, and has since played an important role in addressing the housing needs of victims and survivors of DSGBV, providing direction to local authorities in supporting victims of domestic violence. It covers a range of scenarios that may arise for victims of domestic violence currently in receipt of social housing support and those seeking social housing supports. These include provisions around the use of the Housing Assistance Payment scheme, or the Rental Accommodation Scheme, where a victim has a joint interest in the family home, or ownership of alternative accommodation, but would otherwise qualify for social housing support.  In June 2022 the Department of Justice published Zero Tolerance, the Third National Strategy on DSGBV 2022-2026. As an action in this strategy, my Department committed to a review of the 2017 Policy and Procedural Guidance for Housing Authorities in relation to assisting victims of domestic violence with emergency and long-term accommodation needs in order to ensure continuing effectiveness and consistency in responses to assist victims of domestic violence. My Department is currently engaging with Cuan in relation to this review and proposed recommendations arising from the review. Any updates to the policy and guidance will be communicated to local authorities in due course. In the meantime, local authorities operate in accordance with the 2017 Guidance.  Statutory responsibility in relation to the provision of accommodation and related services for homeless persons rests with individual local authorities. Decisions on the assessment of households for homeless services, the most appropriate form of such support, and the allocation of that support are a matter for the local authority concerned.  Under the Housing Act 1988 it is a matter for each local authority to determine whether a person is regarded as homeless; section 2 of the Act sets out the requirements in this regard. When a household has been assessed as homeless, section 10 of the Housing Act 1988, provides that a local authority may provide accommodation and related services to that household.  Any household assessed as homeless may be placed into temporary emergency accommodation without the requirement to undergo a social housing assessment, allowing local authorities the flexibility that is essential to respond quickly and effectively to the various needs of cases that may arise.  Normally, emergency accommodation is provided by the relevant local authority where an applicant has a local connection, or normally resides, in order to meet an individual’s long-term housing need. However, local authorities have discretion to provide accommodation and related homeless services to a household which has been assessed as homeless and which resides outside the local authority functional area.  Operational issues in the day to day delivery of services, including provision of emergency accommodation provided through a local authority, are a matter for the relevant local authority. The Minister is prevented from intervening in relation to the procedures followed, or decisions made, by local authorities in the provision of housing support in relation to any individual.  With regard to social housing support, the qualification criteria for social housing support are set down in Section 20 of the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2009 and the Social Housing Assessment Regulations 2011, as amended.  A household may apply for social housing support to one local authority only, which may be the authority for the area in which the household normally resides or with which it has a local connection, or where the authority agrees, at its discretion, to assess the household for support.  Therefore, in accordance with the Regulations there is discretion for a local authority to accept applications from any household, including people fleeing domestic violence, that is not resident in its functional area without having established a local connection with the authority’s functional area. Accepting such an application is entirely a matter for the individual authority concerned. ",

'Zero Tolerance,' the Third National Strategy on Domestic, Sexual and Gender-based Violence (DSGBV), set out an ambitious programme of reform to achieve a society which does not accept DSGBV or the attitudes which underpin it.  An Garda Síochána prioritise and proactively respond to incidents of DSGBV.  The nationwide roll out of Divisional Protective Service Units (DPSUs) ensures that when victims of crimes such as domestic abuse and sexual violence present to Gardaí, they are met with a consistently high standard of specialist, sensitive, professional and expert assistance.  There is now a DPSU in every Garda Division.  An Garda Síochána have provided the attached table which details the number of Domestic Abuse Calls reported from 2022 to 2024.  Please note that this does not provide information specific to counties, but instead aligns with An Garda Síochána’s divisional boundaries.  While this data demonstrates a steady increase in the reports to An Garda Síochána, year-on-year and any increase in reports of domestic violence is deeply concerning, there has been significant work undertaken to support victims of DSGBV to come forward and report these matters, and seek the support they have a right to expect.  My Department is continuing to work with agencies in the criminal justice system to strengthen trust and confidence in the system, so that victims will feel more assured in coming forward to report what has happened to them and have access to supports related to the nature of the harm they have experienced.  Domestic Abuse Calls includes the following incidents:  • Breach of Barring Order  • Breach of Emergency Barring Order  • Breach of Safety Order  • Breach of Protection Order  • Breach of Interim Barring Order  • Domestic - No Offence Identified  Or any incident type with a recorded ‘Domestic Abuse’ motive.

'Zero Tolerance,' the Third National Strategy on Domestic, Sexual and Gender-based Violence (DSGBV), set out an ambitious programme of reform to achieve a society which does not accept DSGBV or the attitudes which underpin it.  A key objective of the Strategy is to encourage victims of domestic and sexual violence to come forward and report the heinous crimes being committed against them.  Measures to achieve this have included the 'Always Here' Campaign, a public awareness campaign developed by my department in collaboration with frontline DSGBV services and the 'Hardest Stories' Campaign which has been developed by Cuan in collaboration with my Department, that ran in February 2025. Further campaigns are scheduled to run before the end of this year.  These campaigns, coupled with the establishment of Cuan the DSGBV Agency in 2024, and the DPSU provision by An Garda Síochána are key to addressing the historical and significant under-reporting of such crimes, by supporting victims to come forward and providing services to these victims.  My Department is continuing to work with agencies in the criminal justice system to strengthen trust and confidence in the system, so that victims will feel more assured in coming forward to report what has happened to them and have access to supports related to the nature of the harm they have experienced.  With respect to the Deputy's queries around the numbers of prosecutions, convictions and custodial sentences as they relate to domestic, sexual, and gender based violence between 2022 and 2024, the Courts Service has provided the following tables:  Table 1 - outlines prosecutions  Table 2 - outlines convictions  Table 3 - outlines custodial sentences  Please note that these data have been provided with a number of qualifications.  The Courts Service can only provide the number of offences that have been finalised before the District Court and District Court Appeals for the years 2022 to 2024 under section 33(1) and section 39(1) and (3) of the Domestic Violence Act 2018 by Court Office.  There is no separate code for breach of interim barring order, breach of protection order, breach of barring order, breach of safety order, breach of emergency barring order as they are all prosecuted under the same code.  The data only include offences where offence codes were provided by prosecutors and may not include all relevant offences.  Some of those offences have been sent forward for trial to the Circuit Court At this time, the system in use by the Courts Service in the Circuit Courts cannot produce reports for specific offences.  CAD (Computer Aided Dispatch) incident types are not provided to the Courts Service by prosecutors, therefore the report has been produced using the offence codes which the Courts Service understands meet the information requested.

'Zero Tolerance,' the Third National Strategy on Domestic, Sexual and Gender-based Violence (DSGBV), set out an ambitious programme of reform to achieve a society which does not accept DSGBV or the attitudes which underpin it.  A key objective of the Strategy is to encourage victims of domestic and sexual violence to come forward and report the heinous crimes being committed against them.  Measures to achieve this have included the 'Always Here' Campaign, a public awareness campaign developed by my department in collaboration with frontline DSGBV services and the 'Hardest Stories' Campaign which has been developed by Cuan in collaboration with my Department, that ran in February 2025. Further campaigns are scheduled to run before the end of this year.  These campaigns, coupled with the establishment of Cuan the DSGBV Agency in 2024, and the DPSU provision by An Garda Síochána are key to addressing the historical and significant under-reporting of such crimes, by supporting victims to come forward and providing services to these victims.  My Department is continuing to work with agencies in the criminal justice system to strengthen trust and confidence in the system, so that victims will feel more assured in coming forward to report what has happened to them and have access to supports related to the nature of the harm they have experienced.  With respect to the Deputy's queries around the numbers of prosecutions, convictions and custodial sentences as they relate to domestic, sexual, and gender based violence between 2022 and 2024, the Courts Service has provided the following tables:  Table 1 - outlines prosecutions  Table 2 - outlines convictions  Table 3 - outlines custodial sentences  Please note that these data have been provided with a number of qualifications.

There is no separate code for breach of interim barring order, breach of protection order, breach of barring order, breach of safety order, breach of emergency barring order as they are all prosecuted under the same code.  The data only include offences where offence codes were provided by prosecutors and may not include all relevant offences.  Some of those offences have been sent forward for trial to the Circuit Court At this time, the system in use by the Courts Service in the Circuit Courts cannot produce reports for specific offences.

        "answerText": " Minister for Health  The immunisation programme in Ireland is based on the advice of the National Immunisation Advisory Committee (NIAC). NIAC considers the prevalence of the relevant disease in Ireland as well as international best practice in relation to immunisation when developing its advice.  The current NIAC guidelines state that the shingles vaccine may be considered in those aged 65 years and older, due to the greater burden and severity of disease in this age group and in those aged 18 years and older at increased risk of shingles.  Shingles vaccination is not currently provided as part of the national immunisation programme.  The Health Information and Quality Authority (HIQA) recently carried out a Health Technology Assessment (HTA) on the herpes zoster vaccine which protects against shingles. A HTA is a multidisciplinary research process that collects and summarises information about a health technology. The information can cover a range of fields, including clinical effectiveness and safety, cost-effectiveness and budget impact, organisational and social aspects, and ethical and legal issues. The information is collected and presented in a systematic, unbiased and transparent manner.  HIQA’s HTA examined the evidence on the clinical effectiveness and safety of shingles vaccines. The cost effectiveness and budget impact were also reviewed, along with the ethical, social and organisational implications of including the vaccine in the adult immunisation schedule.  HIQA published this HTA on 19 July 2024. The HTA found that adding the shingles vaccine to the routine immunisation schedule, at the vaccine price at the time, for all adults aged 65 years and over would not be cost effective and would be associated with a substantial budget impact.  Whilst the HTA found that the introduction of the shingles vaccine was not cost effective based on the cost of the vaccine, it found that it could be cost effective for vaccination of those at 75 years and 80 years if the cost of the vaccine was reduced by 80%.  Given that the healthcare budget is finite and decisions regarding increased spending relating to a change in one area could impact the provision of other health technologies and treatments within the healthcare system, the cost-effectiveness must be considered in any decision-making process.  My Department considered the findings of this HTA and determined that the introduction of the vaccine could be reconsidered when the cost effectiveness of the vaccine is confirmed as being more favourable.

        "answerText": " Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage  I propose to take Questions Nos. 47 and 429 together.  Within the Programme for Government 2025 – Securing Ireland’s Future, a commitment was specifically made to continue to accelerate social housing regeneration schemes in Dublin. My Department remains committed to supporting regeneration across towns and cities.  The prioritisation and project plans for the regeneration of estates and flat complexes in Dublin City and other local authorities are a matter for the individual Council.  In order to support local authorities in progressing such regeneration plans, my Department is making a number of funding channels available to Local Authorities and Approved Housing Bodies for such regeneration, including for the redevelopment of flat complexes. These include the:  • Social Housing Investment Programme (SHIP),  • Affordable Housing Fund (AHF),  • Capital Advance Leasing Facility (CALF),  • Cost Rental Equity Loan (CREL) and,  • Regeneration (for remedial works)  For flat complexes that are proposed for refurbishment or a mix of refurbishment and redevelopment, my Department is making funding available through its Estate Regeneration funding channel.  In relation to the referenced projects, I can provide the following updates with respect to social housing regeneration funding applications for the following projects:   Basin Street   This project is included in Bundle 5 of the national Social Housing Public Private Partnership (PPP) programme.  After conducting a review of the proposed costs of Bundle 3 of the Social Housing PPP programme, my Department has decided not to proceed to contract award in the current procurement process for the Social Housing Bundle 3 PPP project. This is due to the overall costs of the Bundle 3 project, which are now considered too high.  In light of the costs on Bundle 3, I have asked my Department to initiate, with the help of the NDFA, a review of Bundles 4 -7 (including the regeneration of Basin View Flats) to determine the most appropriate procurement and delivery strategy in order to ensure the most efficient and effective use of the available public resources.   Oliver Bond House   There is currently no active funding application with my Department for the regeneration of Oliver Bond House. Approval in Principle was issued by my Department in March 2022 for the redevelopment of flats in Blocks L, M and N. A subsequent revised proposal was approved in November 2023.  Dublin City Council (DCC) has advised that work is progressing on the redevelopment of Blocks L, M and N which form part of the Phase 1 proposals.   Dolphin House   There is currently no active funding application with my Department for the regeneration of Dolphin House. Phase 1 of this project was completed in 2018 and delivered 100 homes.  Stage 1B has received Pre-Planning approval by my Department.  The Council has advised that in due course, further phases of the Dolphin house will be submitted for consideration. Once received, my Department will liaise with and review the proposals.   Emmet Buildings   There is currently no active funding application with my Department for the regeneration of Emmet Buildings. A number of improvement and upgrade works have been implemented at Emmet Buildings between 2020 and 2023.   School Street   There is currently no active funding application with my Department for the regeneration of School Street. My Department issued Approval in Principle for School Street in August 2021.   Cherry Orchard   Cherry Orchard Point will deliver circa 1100 homes in a partnership between the LDA and Dublin City Council. My Department has issued Approval to Proceed to Tender for Phase 1 of these works.   Labre Park   The Labre Park Regeneration is being delivered in partnership with Cluid Housing. The Council has advised that an updated funding submission will be issued in Q3 2025. Once received, my Department will liaise with and review the proposal submitted.   Lissadell Maisonettes   My Department has not received a funding application from DCC for regeneration of Lissadel Road Maisonettes. Upgrade and improvement works have been carried out at Lissadell Maisonettes.  In relation to Vicar Street, La Touche Court and Bernard Curtis House, the Council has advised my Department that these sites are not currently on their regeneration programme. ",

I have therefore referred part of the Deputy's question to the RSA for direct reply. I would ask the Deputy to contact my office if a response has not been received within ten days.  Pending this response, I acknowledge that the current waiting times for driving tests, including in the Dublin area, are far in excess of what is acceptable and I would like to assure the Deputy that measures have been taken to address the issue. I met with the RSA last week to discuss this issue and instructed the Authority to return in two weeks with sustainable proposals which will provide a faster resumption to the service level agreement of 10-weeks.  To support the RSA in increasing testing capacity and improving service delivery, in September 2024 my Department sanctioned an additional 70 permanent positions for driver testers. This increases the total permanent sanction for testers to 200, which represents a doubling of permanent posts since June 2022.The recruitment process is underway, with the first tranche of new testers now being deployed into service. As additional testers enter the system, testing capacity will increase and progress should be seen on reducing waiting times in the months ahead.As a condition of the sanction given in September, the RSA was required to put a plan in place to restore the 10-week waiting time target as soon as possible. When this plan was first put forward by the RSA, it envisaged a return to the target by November 2025. This is not acceptable given the level of delays already being suffered by learner drivers. I have instructed the RSA to review the plan and identify further measures that will bring forward the date for achieving the target.  The Deputy may wish to know that driver testing is offered on Saturdays where driver testers are available to do overtime and there are also additional morning and evening test slots offered where daylight allows. This has been the case since the current backlog in driving tests started to build up.  The driver testing booking system has also been updated to allow for any unused test slots to be made available for candidates to take up at short notice. The RSA now make these appointments available for candidates to book on the MyRoadSafety portal. ",

The records on the Irish Genealogy site are updated early every calendar year and the refresh includes an additional year of civil records. This annual release of register data by the Civil Registration Service is part of an ongoing partnership between my Department and the Department of Social Protection.  An additional year of Births, Deaths and Marriages were recently added to the website. The records now available online include birth register records for the years 1864 to 1924, marriage records for the years 1845 to 1949 and death records for the years 1864 to 1974. Civil marriage records from 1954 will not be available on the Irish Genealogy website until early 2030, when these records are 75 years old.  While the indexes for the 1864-1870 death records are on the Irish Genealogy website, the associated images are not currently available. These images are held by General Registration Office (GRO), which is part of the Department of Social Protection.
