        "answerText": " Minister for Education and Youth  The major building project for the school referred to by the Deputy is a large scale capital project for the construction of a new extension and the refurbishment of existing facilities to accommodate 1,000 pupils, including provision for Special Educational Needs (SEN) classrooms.  More than four years has elapsed since the publication of the contract notice and more than two years since the tender submission deadline. Given the passage of time since tenders were returned and the unacceptably high risk that the contract may not successfully be delivered within budget, the ETB were instructed to collapse the tender procedure in July 2025.  My Department officials have engaged with the ETB and School Principal and have proposed to progress a phase 1 of this project through my Department’s timber modular framework which offers an extremely high quality finish and fast delivery.  The proposal relates to Phase 1 of the school extension, covering a gross internal floor area of 1,500 m² includes the superstructure and internal finishes containing additional accommodation for 204 pupils and 4 additional classrooms for pupils with Special Educational Needs with sufficient flexibility to cater for subsequent phases on the site.  In July the Government announced a capital allocation of €7.55 billion for the Department of Education and Youth for the period 2026-2030 under the National Development Plan. As part of this NDP allocation my department will place a strong emphasis on provision for children with special educational needs, with a particular focus on meeting annual school place needs. In relation to project rollout for Large-Scale projects and Additional School Accommodation scheme projects, the approach will be to continue to maximise the capacity of the existing school estate as much as possible in the first instance and provide necessary additional capacity through targeted and prioritised project rollout over the course of 2026 to 2030 period to meet the most urgent and prioritised needs.  Government departments are currently in the process of publishing their sectoral NDP Implementation Plans. The sectoral plan for the Education and Youth sector will be published next week and the first tranche of projects to progress to construction will be published in January. This NDP Implementation Plan will optimise outputs from the NDP allocations, with a strong focus on maximising existing school capacity, progressing priority projects where local capacity across schools in the area is insufficient, and ensuring delivery that is affordable, offers value for money, and meets functional needs.

        "answerText": " Minister of State at the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage  In 2022, the United Nations Convention on Biological Diversity’s Conference of the Parties adopted the Global Biodiversity Framework, setting out a goal of conserving, through protected areas and other effective area-based conservation measures, 30% of terrestrial and marine areas by 2030. This target is reflected in the EU Biodiversity Strategy to 2030, which outlines a similar ambition to protect 30% of the EU’s land area and 30% of the EU’s sea as part of a Trans-European Nature Network. The 30% protection target is a collective commitment at the EU level, rather than a mandatory national target for each individual Member State, reflecting national circumstances. In 2021, government committed to expand Ireland’s Marine Protected Area (MPA) network to 30% of our maritime area by 2030. For the terrestrial goal, the National Parks and Wildlife Service of my Department are assessing the potential for state-owned land to be pledged as protected areas. Progress towards the target is not limited to the designation of protected areas, but may incorporate other effective area-based conservation measures.  The EU Biodiversity Strategy for 2030 led to the creation and adoption of the landmark Nature Restoration Regulation (NRR). The NRR sets out a framework for member states to restore nature, with legally binding targets for the restoration of a wide range of ecosystems; namely rivers, forests, oceans, urban and agricultural areas, and including protected habitats and species. The Regulation came into force in August 2024 and each member state is now required to develop a national Nature Restoration Plan. Ireland has until 1 September 2026 to submit a draft National Restoration Plan to the EU Commission, setting out how we intend to achieve these legally binding targets. Work on the Plan is well underway. The National Parks and Wildlife Service (NPWS) of my Department is coordinating the development of the Plan, working with a wide range of government departments, as well as state bodies and agencies.

Under the Habitats Directive, member states must designate a representative national sample of each habitat listed in Annex I of the Habitats Directive as Special Areas of Conservation (SACs). The criteria for undertaking the selection of sites is set out in Annex III of the Directive. A series of Biogeographical Seminars between EU Member States in the Atlantic region and the EU Commission, and subsequent bilateral meetings between Ireland and the EU Commission, established that the network of terrestrial SACs meets EU sufficiency targets for the protection of Ireland’s habitats and species. The Habitats Directive also defines favourable conservation status of a habitat across the entire national resource, including areas outside SACs. Under Article 17 of the Directive, Member States are required to report on the national conservation status of each habitat listed in Annex I every six years.  The EU Nature Restoration Regulation (NRR) entered into force on 18 August 2024. It sets out a framework for EU Member States to restore nature, with legally binding targets for the restoration of a wide range of ecosystems; namely rivers, forests, oceans, urban and agricultural areas, and including protected habitats and species. The NRR reflects the ambition of the EU Biodiversity Strategy for 2030 by making provision for the non-deterioration of the condition of habitats that are listed in Annex I of the Habitats Directive. Article 4(12) of the Regulation indicates that “…….Member States shall, by the date of publication of their national restoration plans in accordance with Article 17(6) of this Regulation, endeavour to put in place necessary measures with the aim of preventing significant deterioration of areas where the habitat types listed in Annex I to this Regulation occur and which are in good condition or are necessary to meet the restoration targets set out in paragraph 17 of this Article.” Annex I of the NRR comprises the list of habitats listed in Annex I of the Habitats Directive, including Alluvial forests with Alnus glutinosa and Fraxinus excelsior (AlnoPadion, Alnion incanae, Salicion albae). .

        "answerText": " Deputy Paul Nicholas Gogarty  There have been at least 16 meetings of the hearing care plan working group and meetings of subgroups but a report still has not been issued and has now been delayed by over six months into a projected timeline of quarter 1 of next year. Will the Minister outline why the scope has expanded so much beyond initial expectations? Will she confirm a commencement date and a timeline for the related public consultation? \n Deputy Jennifer Carroll MacNeill  The hearing care plan working group was established to develop recommendations for a holistic and sustainable model of hearing care across Ireland. The group initially had a focus on the appropriate linkage of public and private provision to meet increasing demand for services in the short term and to consider the recommendations of the WHO World Report on Hearing in the development of the national hearing care plan.  As the group carried out its work, it realised, through its research efforts and deliberations, that the scope of the work needed to create a holistic model of care, as mandated by the published terms of reference, was greater than initially anticipated. The group saw that as an opportunity to ensure that every aspect of the national audiology service was being addressed thoroughly and, as such, the deadline needed to be pushed back.  While it is unfortunate that the final recommendations are delayed, as per the terms of reference, the group, I believe, will now be in a position to deliver a much more comprehensive and encompassing plan that factors in all aspects of the audiology space and ensures that patients will receive a greater benefit as a result. In response, the group has adjusted its focus and timelines to ensure that all relevant areas of hearing care are appropriately considered. A structured work stream has been established to support this goal, comprising a number of subgroups focusing on key priorities within the overall scope of the project.  The areas being examined by the group include: the existing level and distribution of hearing care provision across Ireland; capacity constraints and opportunities for service enhancement within the HSE; examining the current education structures in place to ensure an adequate number of graduates in public audiology services; workforce planning, with a particular focus on improving recruitment and retention within the public system; the appropriate level and framework for regulation for the audiology profession; improvements to referral pathways in the integration of services between acute and community settings; and mechanisms to strengthen linkages between public and private hearing care aimed at improving patient outcomes and reducing waiting time.  It is wide-ranging work and it is the intention of the group to ensure the final report is comprehensive in the treatment of those matters. \n Deputy Paul Nicholas Gogarty  The Minister mentioned things like workforce planning and obviously there are other issues like paediatric screening, adult rehabilitation pathways and integration with primary care. Can the Minister give any timeline for the public consultation? Will it definitely be in quarter 1 of next year? This arose back in August of last year when the then Minister, Stephen Donnelly, was basically implementing WHO recommendations on providing an holistic package of hearing services. I take the Minister's point and I welcome the fact that the scope has broadened to look at different things. However, has there been discussion of the regulation of the audiology profession? If that has been done, does it include the stakeholders on it? Has best practice abroad been looked at? If not, we are asking people to talk about their own industry. \n Deputy Jennifer Carroll MacNeill  The Deputy is right to identify the difficulty that would create. I do not have an answer at the moment as to the timeline of the public consultation, but I commit to getting that to the Deputy as soon as I can. The revised timeline for submission of a final report is quarter 1 in 2026 but that is more about the timeline for the broad work, as I understand it. Today or tomorrow, I will have a better answer for the Deputy on his very reasonable question on the public consultation element of it. I will also have clarity for him on the question of people reporting on themselves and making sure there is sufficient independence to be able to analyse what needs to be done, particularly on the regulation of professions. \n Deputy Paul Nicholas Gogarty  I know the Minister would be kept up to date on the reports of the subgroups and as she mentioned there have been 16 of them so far and there will be a few more before we get the final report. Can she focus in some way on getting to monitor the specialists? Is there any scope to bring in experts from Northern Ireland, Scotland or England as part of one of the subgroups or is this already happening? This area is not a very well covered nationally but it is hugely important. Hearing loss is a major issue in Ireland and there is a certain stigma associated with it, which is why the WHO made recommendations about having an holistic policy in the first place. I welcome the Minister's response and hopefully we will get to the consultation stage soon. \n Deputy Jennifer Carroll MacNeill  I would like to have a bit more detail that I do not have to hand but I commit to getting it to the Deputy today or tomorrow if that is all right.

        "answerText": " Minister for Health  In recent years significant investment has been made in the health and social care workforce. There have been substantial efforts to build capacity, improve the availability of health professionals and reform their training to support integrated care across the entire health service.  The Department is focused on the need for good and safe working environments, and the need for health-care workers to be provided with the necessary tools and opportunities for career and competence development. This includes initiatives to improve workplace safety, reduce stress and prevent burnout among health-care staff.  Targeting work transformation along with increasing the domestic supply of health and social care professionals will ensure the future workforce planning efforts are cognisant of budgetary and capacity constraints within the health and social care sectors. There is also a need to explore strategies to promote integrated care, maximise capacity and build flexibility and agility in the workforce to deliver on modernised care pathways.  The development of a long term workforce plan is an important step in our future planning to ensure that we have the appropriate health and social care workforce to deliver on Sláintecare, to ensure that the people of Ireland have access to the right care, at the right place in the right time, delivered by the right people with the right skills at the right cost.  Our long-term workforce planning projections tell us that there is an expected shortfall across most of the health and social care staff categories modelled. This is largely due to an insufficient supply of domestic health and social care graduates to replace the existing workforce and meet the increase in demand for health and social care services. Population demographics are the major driver for this increased demand, and it is anticipated that the average annual growth in demand of professions modelled will range from 1.4% to 2%.  Our workforce planning strategies are informed by five interconnected pillars adopted from the WHO’s Framework for Action on the Health and Care Workforce 2023-2030.  - Plan: Using evidence and long-term workforce projections to meet our future workforce needs.  - Build: Building our future workforce supply through expansion of student places and matching the investment in workforce with the needs of the population.  - Optimise Performance: Reforming, maximising capacity and optimising health system performance to support the development of innovative models of care as envisaged under Sláintecare. Having the right mix of healthcare professionals with the right skills, supported by the right technology is essential.  - Recruit and Retain : Considering tailored interventions to improve recruitment and retention. This includes developing career pathways and opportunities to maximise retention. The same strategies may have different effects on different age groups, life stages, professions, locations and genders, and retention efforts need to be tailored accordingly.  - Invest: Targeted and smart investment in health and social workforce is a valuable investment.

The Department is aware that the leisure centre at the Citywest Hotel and Convention centre complex is a valued local amenity with approximately 3,000 members. Following the purchase of the complex, the Department contracted the current provider to oversee the management and provision of service for the gym and the existing workforce was maintained under the transitional agreement.  Due to the public disorder outside of the Citywest Hotel and Convention Centre campus, access had to be restricted to the campus for residents, staff, and members of the public accessing services including the leisure centre and restaurant. This measure was taken to protect the safety of all people who may be on the campus.  Members of the leisure centre were informed about the access restrictions and refund arrangements by the management.  I can further advise the Deputy that community members and representatives were informed on Friday November 7 that members of the gym would be facilitated with access to the Leisure Centre from Tuesday November 11. A number of measures have been put in place to facilitate initial reopening and correspondence has issued to all members to inform them of the reopening of the gym and the new measures in place.  An Garda Síochána is working closely with the Department regarding security arrangements at the campus and this is being kept under regular review.

The Department is aware that the leisure centre at the Citywest Hotel and Convention centre complex is a valued local amenity with approximately 3,000 members. Following the purchase of the complex, the Department contracted the current provider to oversee the management and provision of service for the gym and the existing workforce was maintained under the transitional agreement.  Due to the public disorder outside of the Citywest Hotel and Convention Centre campus, access had to be restricted to the campus for residents, staff, and members of the public accessing services including the leisure centre and restaurant. This measure was taken to protect the safety of all people who may be on the campus.  Members of the leisure centre were informed about the access restrictions and refund arrangements by the management.  I can further advise the Deputy that community members and representatives were informed on Friday November 7 that members of the gym would be facilitated with access to the Leisure Centre from Tuesday November 11. A number of measures have been put in place to facilitate initial reopening and correspondence has issued to all members to inform them of the reopening of the gym and the new measures in place.  An Garda Síochána is working closely with the Department regarding security arrangements at the campus and this is being kept under regular review. Public access to the campus, including the leisure centre, remains restricted at this time and there will be ongoing communication including with local public representatives in respect of any update to this.  It is not appropriate for the Department to disclose detailed information about security arrangements in this context. ",

        "answerText": " Minister for Justice, Home Affairs and Migration  The Community Engagement Team (CET) was established in late 2023 to engage directly with elected representatives, local authorities, community members and service providers, in advance of a new centre opening.  Access to wider public services such as health and education services for IP applicants is set out in Irish and EU law, and this is planned for and provided by the HSE, the Department of Education and other cross-Government services.  As such, IPAS and the CET are in regular contact with NGOs, Community Fora, local services, the HSE, Education services, An Garda Síochána and others, to help prepare for a new centre and new arrivals.  Since its establishment, the CET has worked through the openings of over 130 IPAS and Ukraine accommodation centres. Some of these have involved a simple sharing of information through the relevant channels, while others have involved more detailed meetings with local community groups, local officials, public representatives and other key stakeholders.  The CET responds to local requests for meetings, adjusting to the needs of the relevant community, and this has often involved meeting local resident groups, representatives and individuals.  The team also supports information sharing through a dedicated email service for queries from local groups about new and existing centres.  There have been many consistent examples of meaningful and productive engagement, and service providers and elected representatives around the country demonstrate ongoing support for our work and for our residents.  In relation to larger State-owned sites, the model of engagement has been developed to plan for more meaningful dialogue to support these larger centres, particularly those on state-owned lands being developed under Government policy to move away from dependence on commercial providers.  As part of the Programme for Government 2025, Securing Ireland’s Future, there is a commitment to expand the work of the CET to provide for detailed discussions with communities and to plan more effectively for delivery of increased public services.

RED III stipulates requirements for the permit-granting procedure for renewable energy projects, in addition to requirements designed to support the increased deployment of renewable energy across the electricity, heat and transport sectors, as well as in industry and buildings.  The RED III permitting requirements are designed to streamline and accelerate the permit-granting process for renewable energy projects. Implementation of the permitting requirements of RED III requires coordinated action across the planning system and connection to the grid. Ireland has undertaken, and continues to undertake, a range of measures to support compliance with the RED III permitting requirements.  In respect of Article 16(5), in so far as it applies to the planning system, Chapter 1 of Part 9 of the Planning and Development Act of 2024 was commenced on 13 August 2025 as part of the ongoing phased implementation of the Act of 2024. Chapter 1 concerns procedures through which judicial reviews may be undertaken, addressing particular matters such as time limits for commencing proceedings, legal standing to take such proceedings and various procedural rules relating to such proceedings. Section 281 of the Planning and Development Act 2024 also provides a time limit of 8 weeks applicable to Part 9 judicial review and provides that the High Court may alter that timeline in appropriate circumstances. Section 37 of the Planning and Development Act 2000 provides for an applicant to appeal the decision of a planning authority to An Coimisiún Pleanála. Section 126(2) provides an objective for appeals to be dealt with within 18 weeks.  A new Environmental and Planning Division of the High Court was also established in December 2023, with the intent to provide efficient processing of cases that are specific to the planning and environment context.  In respect of Article 16(5) as it relates to connection to the grid, parties who have a statutory right to be connected to the transmission or distribution systems have a right under Section 34(6)(a) of the Electricity Regulation Act 1999 as amended to refer a dispute they may have with either the transmission system operation or the distribution system operator to the CRU for resolution.  The CRU has a clear and well-established process in place for dealing with disputes efficiently and fairly which is set out in the Section 34(6) Dispute Guidelines document on the Network Connections page of its website. This includes disputes involving the grid connection permit granting process.  If the CRU decides to refuse an Authorisation to Generate or Licence to Construct, the applicant will be notified in writing of the reasons for the refusal and will be informed of the appeals process as per Part IV, Sections 29 to 32 of the Electricity Regulation Act 1999 as amended.

        "answerText": " Deputy Paul Nicholas Gogarty  The most recent time I raised this matter last June, I criticised the current state of Ireland's family court system and highlighted delays, poor facilities and, in particular, a lack of transparency due to the in camera rule. In response, the Minister acknowledged the widespread public frustration with the family law processes. He said that the full removal of the in camera rule was unlikely due to the need to protect children's identities, but that reform was on the way via the family law implementation group working on this issue. He also said we need better environments for hearings and to find a way for the child's voice to be properly heard. Can the Minister please outline the progress made? \n Deputy Jim O'Callaghan  The primary principle must be that justice should be administered in public. However, there are exceptions to it. The in camera rule is one of them, which applies generally in family law proceedings. As the Deputy knows, it does not preclude newspapers or journalists attending in courts where family law disputes are being heard, but it does preclude them from publishing the identities of individuals. I am pleased to say we have seen some progress in the area. Greater reporting is now taking place in respect of what is happening in the family law courts. We frequently see on a Monday in one of the newspapers that there is a weekly report of a family law case proceeding there.  As I said, research was commissioned and published by my Department on the operation of the in camera rule in family law proceedings, and that report contains 21 recommendations. A number of the strategies that have arisen on foot of that report include the publication of the review of the role of expert reports in the family law process too. The Deputy may be aware this issue is quite contentious and is one that is coming within my consideration of family law strategy. I would like to see the lifting of some of the in camera rule restrictions. Many people who have been before the family law process have expressed their concerns about it. An excellent report was produced by academics recently. It was commissioned by my Department and provided to me. It outlined a lot of general dissatisfaction with the operation of the rule. I have not been able to get recommendations together as to how we should proceed in terms of changing the law. Work is ongoing in the Department in this respect. It does take time, consideration and consultation with parties to assess how we should move on. The work, though, is ongoing and I hope to be in a position to have further information for the House in due course. \n Deputy Paul Nicholas Gogarty  We do need to shine more light on these situations. In family disputes involving children, people will sometimes attempt to alienate the kids. The Minister referred to reports. In relation to section 32 and section 47 reports, we have had cases where people have almost treated parental alienation as a proven case when it is not. It is almost like a cult. Immersion therapy is recommended, where children are taken away from their mother for months on end. This is often used as a form of coercive control by a partner who has no real desire to spend time with the children but is using it as a way to punish and control their former partner. In some cases, it has been alleged by a number of people I have met that the judges have said expert Y is very good and they have taken their view. There is no scrutiny or transparency in this regard. It needs to be brought out into the open to protect children. Otherwise, they will be the next generation of abuse cases. \n Deputy Jim O'Callaghan  The Deputy is right that the term and concept of \"parental alienation\" is highly contested and contentious. It is the case with virtually all family law disputes that they become very contested and contentious. I want to try to ensure that when it comes to a family law dispute involving a child there is a mechanism in place to ensure the voice of that child is heard. The system at present probably relies too much on the production of the reports we spoke about a few moments ago. There is a level of dissatisfaction in respect of those reports and I think some of that dissatisfaction is understandable. I need to try to identify another mechanism whereby the voice of the child can become apparent or heard by the court. It is obviously easier in circumstances where there is a teenage child who is able to express their own views to the court, but when it comes to children under the age of ten it gets much more difficult and, as the age declines, it is sometimes virtually impossible to decipher what is in the best interests of the child. It is something we have to keep working on. \n Deputy Paul Nicholas Gogarty  I believe it is important to keep the pressure on and to keep working on this issue. In many instances, these so-called experts are not actually qualified, and in many instances they are actually being paid by one parent to produce the report because the other parent cannot afford to have a similar report. It is not a fair situation and the more the media are able to shed light on the situation and the more scrutiny put on it, the less likely it will be that these types of cases will occur in future. \n Deputy Jim O'Callaghan  Just to let the Deputy know, in terms of the recommendations of the review I referred to a few moments ago, one is that we produce guidelines on the commissioning, content and use of welfare reports. The Chief Justice has established a judicial committee to develop guidelines on the commissioning, content and use of welfare reports.  It is being chaired by Ms Justice Nuala Jackson of the High Court and is being supported by my Department. It is expected to conclude its work shortly. We need to ensure, if reports are being produced for a court, that we are satisfied that they are based upon arcane expertise that is of benefit to the court. All courts are dependent upon getting expert evidence. In some cases, it is appropriate that there is expert evidence to assist the court in deciphering what the wishes of the child are, what the voice of the child is, how the child should be heard and what the child is saying. I can understand why that may be necessary in certain circumstances, particularly for younger children. It is absolutely essential that the system retain confidence in that. That is why I am waiting for the proposals from Ms Justice Nuala Jackson. ",

Applicants are required to have 5 years reckonable residence in the State prior to making an application, except for spouses of Irish nationals where the requirement is 3 years.  As part of the naturalisation application process, an applicant is required to detail any offences they have, regardless of where an incident occurred, or how long ago.  Given the importance of citizenship, my Department also undertakes robust and comprehensive national and international checks on applications, including the Garda e-vetting process, or any other police vetting processes as deemed necessary. All applicants are required to satisfy the good character criterion under Section 15 of the 1956 Act.  At present, no language proficiency requirements apply with respect to naturalisation applications.  The Programme for Government contains a commitment to publish a National Migration and Integration Strategy detailing how the Government intends to meet the demands and opportunities facing Ireland’s society and economy over the next decade. My Department is currently working with other Government Departments to develop this strategy with the aim to publish it in 2026.

        "answerText": " Minister of State at the Department of Education and Youth  I propose to take Questions Nos. 60 and 61 together.  This government is fully committed to supporting children with special educational needs to fulfil their full potential and the Programme for Government makes a number of commitments to deliver on this objective.  Special needs assistants (SNAs) play a central role in the successful inclusion of students with additional and significant care needs in schools by helping to ensure that these students can access an education to enable them to achieve their best outcomes and reach their full potential.  My department has been steadily building on the number of SNAs in our education system. There are now over 23,000 SNAs allocated to schools. working in our education system committed to supporting and nurturing children with special educational needs, enabling them to achieve their best outcomes and reach their full potential. This is the highest number ever.  The National Council for Special Education (NCSE) issues guidance each year to schools regarding SNA reviews and the guidance for 2025/26 school year issued on the 12 September 2025.  It is important to clarify some of the issues raised since publication of the guidelines.  The process for allocating SNAs has been in place since 2014 and is not changing this year. There has been no freeze on SNAs, in fact the number of SNAs in our schools has increased by 43% in the last 5 years alone.  Schools were issued with their allocations for the 2025/26 school year in June and the SNA review window from 15 September to 24 October relates to schools who believe they do not have sufficient SNAs to support their care needs at present.  A school can apply to the NCSE at any time during the school year, as in previous years, for a review where emerging or new care needs arise. An emerging care need for example would be changing care needs in their existing student enrolment, newly identified care need or a new enrolment(s) with care needs.  The NCSE has written to all schools since the publication of the guidelines to clarify that a school can request a review during the school year and not just in the review period set out in the guidelines.  The following are the reasons for the timeline of reviews contained in the guidance:  • Supports the earlier announcement of allocations for the 2026/27 school year to align with the release of the annual staffing schedule.  • Management bodies, staff representative bodies, schools and SNA’s have all requested the department to ensure that SNA allocations issue earlier each year and ideally should align with the general staffing allocation in February each year.  • Supports the SNA workforce by giving them early clarity on their roles.  • Facilitates the SNA Redeployment Scheme.  The role and responsibilities for SNAs has also not changed. SNAs remain responsible for meeting primary care needs for students with special educational needs.  New special classes continue to be supported with additional SNAs each time a new class opens – this has not changed. The NCSE guidelines set out the number of SNAs per each category of special class and there is no change to those baseline allocations.  Any school who has concerns about the level of their SNA allocation should contact their local special education needs organiser. This has always been the case and remains today.  The NCSE assesses the level of need within the school as a whole and this is critical to ensure that the care needs of the entire school are identified and that the school is resourced to meet this identified need. There continues to be separate allocations for mainstream and special classes in individual schools.  When the NCSE completes the SNA review and if additional SNA support is identified as being required it will be provided. This has always been the case.  The NCSE carried out a record number of reviews in 2025 to ensure that children who most needed SNA support could access it. This will continue for 2025/26 school year. I want to assure you that the department and the NCSE, through all of our policy and guidance such as resource allocations, take a child centred focus and approach to ensure that all children in our schools with special education care needs are provided with a supportive environment and the resources needed to help them develop and be prepared for life after school.  The NCSE has confirmed they will be engaging with stakeholders to clarify any issues raised. ",

        "answerText": " Minister for Education and Youth  The brief for the school referred to by the Deputy is for the construction of a new extension and the refurbishment of existing facilities to accommodate 1,000 pupils, including provision for Special Educational Needs (SEN) classrooms.  More than four years has elapsed since the publication of the contract notice and more than two years since the tender submission deadline. Given the passage of time since tenders were returned and the unacceptably high risk that the contract may not successfully be delivered within budget has been identified. On that basis, DDLETB has made the decision to collapse the tender procedure.  In July the Government announced a capital allocation of €7.55 billion for the Department of Education and Youth for the period 2026-2030 under the National Development Plan. As part of this NDP allocation my department will place a strong emphasis on provision for children with special educational needs, with a particular focus on meeting annual school place needs. In relation to project rollout for Large-Scale projects and Additional School Accommodation scheme projects, the approach will be to continue to maximise the capacity of the existing school estate as much as possible in the first instance and provide necessary additional capacity through targeted and prioritised project rollout over the course of 2026 to 2030 period to meet the most urgent and prioritised needs.  My department is now preparing an NDP implementation plan which is due for publication later in the Autumn. This plan will optimise outputs from the NDP allocations, with a strong focus on maximising existing school capacity, progressing priority projects where local capacity across schools in the area is insufficient, and ensuring delivery that is affordable, offers value for money, and meets functional needs.

        "answerText": " Minister for Social Protection  The Government is committed to protecting vulnerable households from the impact of energy costs through a combination of financial supports, energy efficiency awareness initiatives and investment in programmes to improve the energy efficiency of the housing stock.  The Programme for Government includes a commitment to examine key ancillary benefits such as the Fuel Allowance, Household Benefits and the Living Alone Increase to support vulnerable groups. This is an ongoing activity as part of the Department's budget planning each year and I will continue, as part of the budget planning process, to consider if improvements can be made to ensure that these benefits continue to target vulnerable groups. Any future decisions will, of course, have to take account of the availability of financial resources.  There have been significant improvements made in recent years to the Fuel Allowance Scheme. These improvements have resulted in many more households qualifying for the payment.  In 2023, the enhanced Fuel Allowance measures for people aged 70 years and over were introduced. Disablement Benefit and Half-rate Carers Allowance payment were disregarded when assessing means for Fuel Allowance purposes. Disablement Benefit no longer prevents a household from receiving the Fuel Allowance payment.  In 2024, the allowable means for those aged 70 and over was increased to €512 a week for a single person and to €1,024 a week for a couple. Periods spend on Community Employment, Tús or the Rural Social Scheme can now be used to satisfy the 312-day requirement for Fuel Allowance.  In Budget 2025, Carer’s Allowance became a qualifying payment for Fuel Allowance, and the enhanced over 70’s Fuel Allowance qualifying conditions were extended to people aged 66 and over. The allowable means for those aged 66 and over was increased to €524 a week for a single person and to €1,048 a week for a couple.  The recent expansions to the Fuel Allowance Scheme have resulted in the Budget for the scheme increasing significantly with an estimated expenditure on the scheme in 2025 of €400.5 million compared to an expenditure of €290.45 million in 2020.  The Government will continue to monitor the cost-of-living situation closely and how it can support people on low incomes and those on social welfare payments who are at risk of fuel poverty.  I trust that this clarifies the matter for the Deputy. ",

The State purchase of the Citywest Hotel and Convention Centre for international protection accommodation is now completed.  The purchase of the site is a key part of the Government’s strategy to develop a stable and sustainable accommodation system for people seeking international protection. State-owned centres are part of the Government’s long-term plan to reduce the reliance on private accommodation providers resulting in better value for money of public funds and a more efficient international protection system.  The full purchase price for the Citywest centre (including VAT) was €148,253,530 which is in line with the Government decision of 17 June 2025. Compared to the costs of the previous leasing model, the savings to the State will pay back the purchase price within 4 years. The State is estimated to save €1 billion over 25 years, compared to the current model for leasing the site, while also delivering a permanent State asset.  The Department carried out a number of surveys including technical, mechanical and fire safety for the site as part of a detailed due diligence process followed to secure this purchase.  A 12-month transitional service agreement has been put in place with the current provider to oversee the management and provision of accommodation services for both the main hotel and the convention centre. The existing workforce has been maintained under the transitional agreement. Over the coming 12 months a process to tender for a provider to run the Citywest complex will be completed.  The Citywest Hotel and Convention Centre has successfully supported accommodation and decision-processing by the State for a number of years, and currently provides capacity for 2,300 people, with both international protection applicants and people from Ukraine resident in the Hotel and Convention Centre. There are no plans in place to increase capacity at the site.  The Department does not routinely publish occupancy figures for accommodation centres, for privacy and security reasons, and also because occupancy levels vary from day to day for operational reasons.  In terms of planning permission, this is an existing accommodation centre for people seeking international protection and for people fleeing the war in Ukraine who are Beneficiaries of Temporary Protection which is deemed an exempted development under the Planning and Development (Exempted Development) (No. 4) Regulations (S.I. 605 of 2022).  The Planning and Development (Exempted Development) (No. 4) Regulations (S.I. 605 of 2022) were introduced to assist the State in meeting Ireland’s legal obligation to provide accommodation to international protection applicants.  As a hotel and convention centre, the Citywest Hotel and Convention Centre’s change of use is permitted as exempt development under the provisions of Class 20F of the Planning and Development (Exempted Development) (No. 4) Regulations (S.I. 605 of 2022).  The Regulations 2023 (S.I. 376 of 2023) extended the planning exemption provided by S.I. 605 of 2022, from 31 December 2024 to 31 December 2028.  In terms of other potential purchases, an Expression of Interest (EOI) process was launched in 2024 for the sourcing of suitable properties for acquisition or lease. 134 submissions have been received. These options are being assessed.  IPAS centres are subject to rigorous inspection and oversight. Centres are contractually obligated to be maintained to National Standards, with independent inspection and quality control through either the Health Information and Quality Authority (HIQA) or IPAS-commissioned inspections.  IPAS accommodation centres are staffed by accommodation providers who employ managers and staff working in centres. Centre management is responsible for ensuring that appropriate vetting is in place for various centres and staff, and for providing assurance to IPAS and the Department that this is in place.

The Department is committed to ensuring that the local community has access to accurate information and that structures to plan for provision of essential and support services, such as healthcare and education, are in place to assist with the integration process.

Centres are contractually obligated to be maintained to National Standards, with independent inspection and quality control through either the Health Information and Quality Authority (HIQA) or IPAS-commissioned inspections.  IPAS accommodation centres are staffed by accommodation providers who employ managers and staff working in centres. Centre management is responsible for ensuring that appropriate vetting is in place for various centres and staff, and for providing assurance to IPAS and the Department that this is in place.  Contracts for international protection accommodation are treated as confidential and commercially sensitive, but details of all payments to accommodation providers are published regularly on gov.ie at IPAS Statistics/Facts and Figures.  The Community Engagement Team was established at the end of 2023. In line with commitments in the Programme for Government, since the purchase of the site was confirmed, the Community Engagement Team has been engaging broadly with local stakeholders, including members of the Community Integration Forum in South Dublin County Council.  The Department is committed to ensuring that the local community has access to accurate information and that structures to plan for provision of essential and support services, such as healthcare and education, are in place to assist with the integration process.

The State purchase of the Citywest Hotel and Convention Centre for international protection accommodation is now completed.  The purchase of the site is a key part of the Government’s strategy to develop a stable and sustainable accommodation system for people seeking international protection. State-owned centres are part of the Government’s long-term plan to reduce the reliance on private accommodation providers resulting in better value for money of public funds and a more efficient international protection system.  The full purchase price for the Citywest centre (including VAT) was €148,253,530 which is in line with the Government decision of 17 June 2025. Compared to the costs of the previous leasing model, the savings to the State will pay back the purchase price within 4 years. The State is estimated to save €1 billion over 25 years, compared to the current model for leasing the site, while also delivering a permanent State asset.  The Department carried out a number of surveys including technical, mechanical and fire safety for the site as part of a detailed due diligence process followed to secure this purchase.  A 12-month transitional service agreement has been put in place with the current provider to oversee the management and provision of accommodation services for both the main hotel and the convention centre. The existing workforce has been maintained under the transitional agreement. Over the coming 12 months a process to tender for a provider to run the Citywest complex will be completed.  The Citywest Hotel and Convention Centre has successfully supported accommodation and decision-processing by the State for a number of years, and currently provides capacity for 2,300 people, with both international protection applicants and people from Ukraine resident in the Hotel and Convention Centre. There are no plans in place to increase capacity at the site.  The Department does not routinely publish occupancy figures for accommodation centres, for privacy and security reasons, and also because occupancy levels vary from day to day for operational reasons.  In terms of planning permission, this is an existing accommodation centre for people seeking international protection and for people fleeing the war in Ukraine who are Beneficiaries of Temporary Protection which is deemed an exempted development under the Planning and Development (Exempted Development) (No. 4) Regulations (S.I. 605 of 2022).  The Planning and Development (Exempted Development) (No. 4) Regulations (S.I. 605 of 2022) were introduced to assist the State in meeting Ireland’s legal obligation to provide accommodation to international protection applicants.

This supports the people in question to make longer term independent arrangements.  Council Directive 2001/55/EC (the Temporary Protection Directive) is an emergency provision designed to quickly and humanely respond to the mass displacement of persons. It requires, among other things, that eligible applicants are supplied with necessary and accessible documentation and information on additional supports.  I am advised by my officials that the use of the facilities to which the Deputy refers is of a high standard and complies with our obligations under the Temporary Protection Directive. The Directive in question does not set out any standards with regard to such facilities or reporting obligations with regard to such properties.  The Deputy may wish to note that under the Directive, there are reporting requirements to the Commission with regard to “data concerning the number of persons enjoying temporary protection and full information on the national laws, regulations and administrative provisions relating to the implementation of temporary protection.”  My Department regularly reports on the numbers of persons granted temporary protection.

Under the European Union’s Habitats Directive, transposed into Irish law by the European Communities (Birds and Natural Habitats) Regulations 2011 (S.I. No. 477/2011), Ireland is required to designate Special Areas of Conservation (SACs) for the protection of endangered habitats and species as listed in the Directive. These sites are notified to the European Commission who adopt them as Sites of Community Importance. Together with Special Protected Areas (SPAs) for Birds, these form the network of Natura 2000 sites. There are more than six hundred such sites in Ireland.  In terms of planned designations, scientific staff within the National Parks and Wildlife Service (NPWS) identify and evaluate candidate sites before designation. Most recently, two large off shore marine sites - Porcupine Shelf cSAC 2267 and the Southern Canyons cSAC 2278 – added more than three million hectares to the network of Special Areas of Conservation, and raised the percentage nationally of our reef habitat that is protected within Natura 2000 from 10% to 24%. These two sites are currently candidate SACs, and subject to the completion of the statutory appeals process, will proceed to full SAC and SCI status in due course. The North West Irish Sea candidate SPA and the Seas off Wexford candidate SPA cover a combined area of more than 530,000 hectares and now protect more than 20 of our rarest and most threatened bird species. Similarly, these two candidate Special Protection Areas are working through the statutory process and subject to the outcome of that process will proceed to full SPA status.
