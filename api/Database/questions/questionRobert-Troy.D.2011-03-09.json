        "answerText": " Minister of State at the Department of Justice, Home Affairs and Migration  Last month Minister O'Callaghan and I secured Government approval to introduce new policies and legislative changes to strengthen Ireland’s migration and asylum system to ensure it is rules-based, efficient and more aligned with EU Member States.  As part of this, I intend to make a number of changes to the rules on the granting of citizenship, one of which relates to the residency requirements of a person granted international protection to be granted citizenship, which came into effect on 8 December 2025.  I want to clarify for the Deputy that International Protection applicants are not eligible to apply for naturalisation. Only individuals who have been granted an International Protection declaration and who have accrued the required period of reckonable residence in the State can be considered for Irish citizenship.  Previously, individuals granted international protection status could apply for citizenship after a time period of three years. Effective from 8 December 2025 persons granted international protection will generally be required to have five years of reckonable residence in the State before they can apply for citizenship.  Applications for citizenship received before 8 December 2025 will continue to be processed under the previous three year rule, while applications submitted on or after that date will be assessed in line with the new five year residency requirement. This change brings citizenship applicants with international protection status in line with most other citizenship applicants.  All applications for a certificate of naturalisation are assessed individually based on the provisions of the Irish Nationality and Citizenship Act 1956, as amended.  Detailed information on how to apply for naturalisation and other resources is available on my Department’s Immigration website here: [ https://www.irishimmigration.ie/how-to-become-a-citizen/ ] ",

        "answerText": " Minister for Education and Youth  The project to which the deputy refers has been devolved to the National Development Finance Agency (NDFA) for delivery as part of a programme of school building projects.  The brief for this project comprises of the development of a new build Post Primary school to accommodate a long-term projected enrolment of 1,000 pupils and will include a 6 classroom SEN base.  The project is currently at Stage 3 of the architectural design process – Tender Stage. The length of time a project takes to go through each stage varies and depends on a number of factors, including scale and complexity. The NDFA will be engaging directly with the school authority to keep it informed of progress.  My Department is committed to ensuring appropriate school accommodation is available for all children in Franciscan College and will in the wider context outlined, ensure that this project - as for all projects on the school building programme - is subject to the due diligence required under the public Infrastructure Guidelines.  In July, the Government announced a capital allocation of €7.55 billion for the Department of Education and Youth for the period 2026-2030 under the National Development Plan. As part of this NDP allocation my department will place a strong emphasis on provision for children with special educational needs, with a particular focus on meeting annual school place needs.  In relation to project rollout for Large-Scale projects and Additional School Accommodation scheme projects, the approach will be to continue to maximise the capacity of the existing school estate as much as possible in the first instance and provide necessary additional capacity through targeted and prioritised project rollout over the course of 2026 to 2030 period to meet the most urgent and prioritised needs.  Government departments are currently in the process of publishing their sectoral NDP Implementation Plans. The sectoral plan for the Education and Youth sector will be published next week and the first tranche of projects to progress to construction will be published in January. This NDP Implementation Plan will optimise outputs from the NDP allocations, with a strong focus on maximising existing school capacity, progressing priority projects where local capacity across schools in the area is insufficient, and ensuring delivery that is affordable, offers value for money, and meets functional needs.  The current status of all projects is listed on a county-by-county basis at www.gov.ie. under item number 10 and this is updated on a regular basis to reflect project progress through the various stages of capital appraisal, site acquisition, design, tender and construction.

Funding for EV Charging Scheme was one action of a wide range of actions managed by the Eastern and Midland Regional Assembly (EMRA) under the JTF. My Department was not involved in the reallocation of the unspent funding to other schemes.  In terms of advancing the sites identified in the preparation for the EV scheme, I would expect that the majority of these can be taken forward through the Local Authority EV charging networks, under the remit of each individual Local Authority. Local authorities will be funded by Zero Emission Vehicles Ireland (ZEVI) to develop local and regional EV charging network strategies and implementation plans. This process will identify the capacity and number of charge points required in each area, including on-street chargers to serve residents without access to private off-street parking.  Some authorities have already completed their strategies, while others are in progress. It is anticipated that most of these plans will be finalised by end of 2025. While strategies are being finalised, ZEVI is funding 26 pilot infrastructure projects across 15 Local Authorities and dedicated EV charging infrastructure officers. ",

        "answerText": " Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine  My Department provides a range of financial supports that focus on compensating farmers for both direct and indirect losses incurred as a result of a TB breakdown on the farm.  The primary support scheme is the On Farm Market Valuation scheme, where animals removed as reactors receive compensation equivalent to what their market value would have been if they had not been disclosed as TB reactors, subject to scheme ceilings. Further supports are available through the Income Supplement Scheme, Depopulation Grant scheme and the Hardship Grant scheme.  The animals in the herd referred to were non-pedigree and my Department's ceiling of €3,000 is applicable to non-pedigree animals.  In the period up to 31st of October, of the 32,860 animals valued under the On Farm Market Valuation scheme, just under 97% of animals were valued below the scheme ceilings.  As part of the work of the TB Forum, a dedicated Financial Working Group was established to review the financial modelling of various elements of the bovine TB Eradication programme.  As a result of the agreement reached in this Group in 2023, there were rate enhancements to the Income Supplement Scheme, the Hardship Grant and the Depopulation Grant as well as enhanced ceilings for select animals being removed as part of the On Farm Market Valuation Scheme.  In addition, the Financial Working Group also expanded the eligibility criteria under the Income Supplement Scheme and Hardship Grant Schemes.  Due to the increased cost of the bTB programme in recent years, the focus at present is on reducing the levels of disease which will reduce the impact of bTB on Irish farm families and reduce the cost of the programme which rose to over €100 million in 2024, a figure which will be exceeded in 2025.

The Community Pharmacy Agreement 2025 was published on the 18th of September 2025, following the successful conclusion of negotiations with the Irish Pharmacy Union (IPU). The Agreement is supported by a €75 million new investment across 2025 and 2026.  The Agreement marks a significant milestone in the strategic collaboration between the Department of Health, the Health Service Executive (HSE), and the IPU. It sets out a comprehensive and ongoing pathway to modernise and expand the role of community pharmacy in Ireland’s healthcare system.  The Agreement is available on the Department of Health’s website at the following link: www.gov.ie/en/department-of-health/publications/community-pharmacy-agreement-2025/.  It is important to note that the Community Pharmacy Agreement 2025 does not remove phased dispensing.  Phased dispensing was introduced in 1996 for patient safety reasons. The supply of medication in instalments can support patients prescribed certain high-risk medications who are at risk of medication misadventure if these medications were to be supplied monthly, as is the norm under the community drug schemes. Where a phased dispensing claim is submitted, the current requirement is that an item must be dispensed in the pharmacy across multiple supply occasions. Community pharmacies receive additional payments in respect of phased dispensing.  Monitored Dosing Systems are systems that enable the individual medicine doses to be organised according to the prescribed dose schedule. These are sometimes referred to as blister packs. The State has never agreed to fund Monitored Dosing Systems.  However, a practice has built up whereby the use of Monitored Dosing Systems are charged as if for phased dispensing. The State has never agreed to this. Phased claiming was never intended to be used to submit claims in lieu of the provision of Monitored Dosing Systems.  Whilst Monitored Dosing Systems may have a role for some patients there is significant uncertainty around the robustness of the evidence supporting its use.  The National Centre for Pharmacoeconomics carried out an evidence assessment which indicated that the evidence was, at best, equivocal to support such a programme.  Significant expenditure is therefore being incurred where it was never intended by the State. It has been agreed to introduce improved controls in this regard and to limit the use of phased dispensing to specified high risk drugs, where a patient safety concern may exist.  Phased dispensing support is currently available for medical card holders under the General Medical Services (GMS) Scheme for the following reasons:  Reason 1 - at the request of a patient's physician.  Reason 2 - due to the inherent nature of a medicinal product i.e. product stability and shelf life.  Reason 3 - where a patient is commencing new drug therapy with a view to establishing patient tolerance and acceptability before continuing on a full treatment regime.  Reason 4 - in exceptional circumstances where the patient is incapable of safely and effectively managing the medication regimen.  Under the Community Pharmacy Agreement 2025, from January 2026, phased dispensing under reason 1 and 4 will be limited to a defined set of high-risk medication classes. These are:  • Psychotropics;  • Opioids;  • Codeine; and  • Pregabalin and gabapentin.  The approved list of medications under these classes will be provided by the HSE in due course.  For reasons 1 and 4, by focusing phased dispensing reimbursement on the medication categories on the approved list, phased dispensing payments can be targeted to medications with the highest risk or potential for misuse.  Phased dispensing fees will remain payable as per current arrangements under reasons 2 and 3 and will not be subject to the approved list.  The salient point here is that appropriate phased dispensing is not being removed in this Agreement.  The introduction of improved controls around phased dispensing is being done in a way which puts patient safety first and allows the State to repurpose funding to be used to implement new patient-centred services.  It remains open to pharmacies to charge patients for the use of Monitored Dosing Systems as a private service.  The Agreement is designed to support the delivery of safe, equitable, and efficient healthcare, and to ensure that community pharmacists are better equipped to contribute to national health priorities through structured engagement, sustainable funding, and integrated service delivery.  Under the Agreement, a Strategic Collaboration Group will be established from early 2026 which will provide a structured forum for dialogue and joint consideration of strategic issues shaping the future of community pharmacy in Ireland.  The Agreement also includes the establishment of a rolling annual medicines optimisation programme with dedicated annual funding. The Strategic Collaboration Group will be tasked with exploring the best way to utilise this fund. ",

A delay in progressing these promotions was due to the requirement for an amendment to Defence Force Regulation R5 to enable the convening of a national authority for RDF promotion competitions, a practice that mirrors PDF officer promotion competitions. The military authorities have further advised that additional delays occurred as, given the nature of Reserve service and candidate availability, allied with the substantial number of candidates presenting, the board proceedings were of a longer duration than that which would routinely apply in a PDF context.  The filling of these and other positions continues to be recognised as an essential enabler in the continuing Reserve Revitalisation process. ",

In recent months, Zero Emission Vehicles Ireland (ZEVI), the Eastern & Midland Regional Assembly (EMRA), and the relevant Local Authorities have engaged in extensive discussions to determine the most effective structure for the scheme.  Throughout this process, a number of significant risks were identified. Following careful consideration, it became clear that these risks, particularly the risk of delays that could prevent completion within the required timeframe under the 'N+3' rule, were too substantial to be confident of successful delivery. For this scheme, that deadline was 31 December 2026. If delivery was not within the required deadline, the funds would have been lost to Ireland and the region.  To safeguard the funding for the region, the resources originally allocated to this scheme have now been be redirected to an alternative initiative. This approach ensures that the EU investment remains in place and continues to support our shared goal of advancing sustainable transport.  Where site inspections are already completed for all eligible locations, the Department will work closely with Local Authorities to explore opportunities to incorporate viable sites into regional and local strategies, ensuring that the groundwork completed to date contributes meaningfully to future plans.

        "answerText": " Minister for Education and Youth  Investment and expenditure on sports facilities in both primary and post-primary schools is an element of the overall expenditure and investment in the School Building Programme. Practically all schools have outdoor play areas and many schools use adjacent local community facilities. The provision of outdoor play areas form part of the accommodation brief for all new school buildings or where a major building or refurbishment project is being delivered for an existing school. Co-operation between schools and local sporting organisations in sharing their sporting facilities provides opportunities to apply for sports grants including the Sports Capital Grant administered by the Department of Culture, Communications and Sport. The provision of capital funding for outdoor recreation facilities is just one way in which we support increased physical activity. The redeveloped primary curriculum specification for physical education extends the time available for PE with a particular emphasis on community partnerships and the use of the outdoor environment generally.  Since 2020, my department has invested over €6 billion in our schools throughout the country under the National Development Plan, involving the completion of over 1,300 school building projects. 111 of these were large scale school projects all of which would have included extensive accommodation including outdoor play areas. In July, the Government announced a capital allocation of €7.55 billion for the Department of Education and Youth for the period 2026-2030 under the National Development Plan. All Government departments are expected to publish their sectoral NDP Implementation Plans in November. My department’s plan will optimise outputs from the NDP allocations, with a strong focus on maximising existing school capacity, progressing priority projects where local capacity across schools in the area is insufficient, and ensuring delivery that is affordable, offers value for money, and meets functional needs. Funding will also be invested to support curricular delivery and well-being across schools by prioritising the development of Physical Education halls and sporting facilities (including yards and play areas) for schools in conjunction with the Sports Capital Fund to deliver for both schools and communities.  My Department's Climate Action Summer Works Scheme provides a mechanism for school authorities to make small-scale improvements to school buildings and also the schools external areas such as outdoor play areas. The first tranche of approvals under this Scheme is due to be announced shortly. Schools can also use their minor works grant to upgrade outdoor play areas while repairs to existing areas may be considered under the department’s Emergency Works Scheme. ",

        "answerText": " Minister for Education and Youth  A teacher who is employed for less than 150 hours in a school year is deemed to be a casual part-time teacher. A casual part-time teacher will be paid at the casual rate of pay.  A teacher who is contracted for more than 150 hours but for less than a school year is deemed to be a non-casual part-time teacher. A non-casual part-time teacher will be paid at the appropriate personal rate of pay.  Teachers who are appointed to contracts for the whole school year are also paid at the appropriate personal rate of pay.  It is therefore only teachers who are classified as casual part-time teachers that are paid the casual rate of pay.  Where a casual part-time teacher who is employed for less than 150 hours in a school year, subsequently exceeds 150 hours, the additional hours will be paid at the non-casual rate of pay.  In general, teachers will have contracted class contact time of up-to 22 hours a week at post-primary level and up to 25 hours a week at primary level.  In recent years, at post-primary level, the Department has operated a temporary scheme, titled the Teaching Hours Extension scheme, which allows for post-primary teachers who have satisfied the 22 hours contract requirements, including teachers working in a substitute or casual part-time capacity, to provide additional substitute teaching hours up to a maximum of 35 hours per term.  Pay and workplace reform measures for public servants have been governed by a framework of public service pay agreements for a number of years with the new Public Service Agreement (PSA) 2024-2026 in place until June 2026.  The Government is committed to the delivery of quality public services and will continue to approach public service pay in a balanced way that is reasonable and fair to both public servants and to the taxpayer. With regards to arrangements in place in relation to the payment of substitute teachers, these arrangements are applied in line with agreements reached between the parties to the Conciliation and Arbitration Scheme for teachers and confirmed in Circular Letter 0028/2004.  Any further amendments to Teacher Terms and Conditions, including pay and allowances, can only be achieved through engagement and collective bargaining agreements between the Government and the public service unions or through the Teachers Conciliation Council (TCC) forum.  The criteria for the award of incremental credit are set out in the Department’s Circulars 10/2001, for primary teachers, and 29/2007 and 29/2010, for post-primary teachers. The criteria for the award of incremental credit to recognised teachers were agreed under the auspices of the Teachers Conciliation Council (TCC).  These circulars provide for the award of incremental credit in respect of overseas teaching service, both within and outside the EU. Where a school satisfies the criteria set out in the circulars to have service at that school recognised for incremental credit, an award of incremental credit can be made. There is no contractual entitlement to incremental credit.  Where schools do not satisfy the required criteria, then service at that school cannot be considered towards incremental credit. Teachers must be on the Department of Education and Youth’s teacher payroll or teaching in an Education and Training Board school before an application can be processed.  At post-primary level, teachers may claim incremental credit for prior teaching service carried out in Ireland. Casual post-primary part-time teachers must reach a threshold of 300 hours in one year and must satisfy criteria set out in the relevant circular. Where they satisfy the relevant criteria, a post-primary casual part-time teacher will receive an increment for each 600 hours worked.  The criteria for the award of incremental credit for teachers are subject to review by way of an incremental credit committee, which is a sub-committee of the Teachers Conciliation Council, and which meets on an ongoing basis.

I understand that extended wait times can be frustrating for applicants. I want to assure anyone who has an application for naturalisation submitted that the Citizenship Division of my Department is doing everything possible to progress applications as quickly as possible.  It is important to note, however, that no two naturalisation applications are the same and some take longer than others to process. Given the importance of citizenship, robust and comprehensive checks must take place on each application. Unfortunately, some checks, such as international checks, can take a considerable amount of time and these are largely outside of the control of the Immigration Service.  For that reason, while, I expect that going forward, that most applicants will receive a decision within one year, this cannot be guaranteed in the case of applications made in any specific year.  Citizenship Division have taken a significant number of steps to improve up the process for applicants. These included introducing an online digital application, online payments, and the introduction of eVetting. I am pleased to inform the Deputy that these changes are reducing processing times.  Applicants can now directly check the status of their immigration application on the Immigration Service’s Customer Service Portal. They can register for, or log in to their existing account, at: portal.irishimmigration.ie/en/  As an Oireachtas member, you can also request the status of individual immigration cases by e-mail, using the Oireachtas Mail facility at: IMoireachtasmail@justice.ie, which has been specifically established for this purpose. This service enables up to date information on such cases to be obtained without the need to seek information by way of the Parliamentary Question process. ",

        "answerText": " Minister for Children, Disability and Equality  The 2025/2026 Core Funding Partner Service Funding Agreement includes provisions for the undertaking of a further Fee Increase Assessment-type exercise, which will seek to support the ongoing viability of services where fees are particularly low.  The details of this undertaking are being developed by the Department and as part of this development, every effort will be made to carefully manage the potential out-of-pocket expenses to families occasioned by this policy.  It should be noted that, as with 2024/2025 Fee Increase Assessment, the new exercise will be designed to identify and support those services whose fees may have been frozen at a very low level.  The details of the 2025/2026 fee increase process will be communicated to the sector once finalised.  Regarding staff pay, a new Core Funding element, the Staff Funding Additional Contribution, has been introduced to centre-based services in programme year 2025/2026 to facilitate the distribution of €45 million in funding ringfenced for staff pay and conditions in Budget 2025.  The Staff Funding Additional Contribution is intended to support early learning and childcare services to meet the increased minimum rates of pay in the sector as a result of new Employment Regulation Orders (EROs) negotiated by the independent Joint Labour Committee.  The EROs apply to workers who are wholly or mainly in direct contact with children and who are involved in the education and/or care of children, or who may work directly with children in addition to their day-to-day managerial duties and responsibilities.  The Staff Funding Additional Contribution is an additional contribution, and therefore will be allocated to services in addition to their base rate, minimum base rate, and Graduate Premiums.  The Government is committed to supporting a new ERO process in the second half of 2026 and to making available a similar sum in 2026 for a further future round of pay improvements, subject to the deliberations of the independent Joint Labour Committee.  The State is providing Core Funding to promote the interests of children and their families and workers in a privately operated sector. A service’s Core Funding grant is designed to support the costs of:  • Staff pay and conditions, including contact and non-contact time, holiday pay, sick pay and other employer costs  • Administrative staff/time  • Non-staff overhead costs  An allocation of €405 million for the Scheme was secured in Budget 2026. This is an increase of €51 million on the 2025 allocation of €353.23 million – representing a 15% year-on-year increase and a 56% increase over the 2022 allocation of €259 million.  In addition, €20.6 million in brand new funding for a full programme year has been secured to support providers in adhering to the Scheme’s fee management conditions including reductions in the maximum fee caps in the 2026/2027 programme year. This will guarantee that Core Funding’s monetary protections will continue to be passed on to families while ensuring sustainability and stability for the sector.  Where there are concerns regarding the financial sustainability of a service, the Department oversees a system of case management through which local City and County Childcare Committees (CCCs) assist services. Supports can include help with cashflow, fee setting and completing and interpreting analysis of staff ratios, as well as more specialised advice and support appropriate to individual circumstances.

        "answerText": " Minister for Education and Youth (Deputy Helen McEntee)  The project referred to by the Deputy has been devolved to the National Development Finance Agency (NDFA) for delivery as part of a programme of school building projects (Project Dargle bundle).  The brief for the project is to provide an extension and refurbishment to the existing school building to accommodate a long-term projected enrolment of 1,000 pupils and also provide a 4 classroom Special Education Needs base for the school.  The project is currently at Stage 2b of the architectural design process (pre-tender stage). A full grant of planning permission was received in March 2024. The NDFA are currently working to conclude the pre-tender stage following which a Stage 2b report will be submitted to the Department.  Once the Stage 2b report has been submitted, the project will be subject to the necessary review and due diligence in accordance with the Public Infrastructure Guidelines.  While at this early stage it is not possible to provide a timeline for completion of this project, the NDFA will continue to engage directly with the school authorities to keep them fully informed of progress on this important project  In July, the Government announced a capital allocation of €7.55 billion for the Department of Education and Youth for the period 2026-2030 under the National Development Plan. As part of this NDP allocation my department will place a strong emphasis on provision for children with special educational needs, with a particular focus on meeting annual school place needs.  In relation to project rollout for Large-Scale projects and Additional School Accommodation scheme projects, the approach will be to continue to maximise the capacity of the existing school estate as much as possible in the first instance and provide necessary additional capacity through targeted and prioritised project rollout over the course of 2026 to 2030 period to meet the most urgent and prioritised needs. It is planned that circa 80 school building projects will progress to construction across 2026 and 2027 as part of a 2-year rolling programme.  All Government departments are expected to publish their sectoral NDP Implementation Plans in November. My department’s plan will optimise outputs from the NDP allocations, with a strong focus on maximising existing school capacity, progressing priority projects where local capacity across schools in the area is insufficient, and ensuring delivery that is affordable, offers value for money, and meets functional needs. This will be the context for assessing all project rollout for the 2026 to 2030 period including in relation to St Joseph’s Secondary School, Rochfortbridge.  Regarding the details of the other projects in the Dargle bundle as requested by the Deputy, I can confirm that Project Dargle comprises of seven post-primary schools as listed below. All are similarly at Stage 2b of the architectural design process (pre-tender).  • St Joseph's Secondary School, Rochfortbridge, Co Westmeath  • Moate Community School, Co.Westmeath  • Castlepollard Community College, Co.Westmeath  • Avondale Community College, Co.Wicklow  • Arklow CBS, Co.Wicklow  • Colaiste Bhride, Carnew, Co.Wicklow  • St Kevins Community College, Dunlavin,Co.Wicklow  The current status of all projects is listed on a county-by-county basis at .gov.ie. and this is updated on a regular basis to reflect project progress through the various stages of capital appraisal, site acquisition, design, tender and construction .

        "answerText": " Minister for Health  The Community Pharmacy Agreement 2025 does not remove phased dispensing.  Phased dispensing was introduced in 1996 for patient safety reasons. The supply of medication in instalments can support patients prescribed certain high-risk medications who are at risk of medication misadventure if these medications were to be supplied on a monthly basis, as is the norm under the community drug schemes. Where a phased dispensing claim is submitted, the current requirement is that an item must be dispensed across multiple supply occasions. Community pharmacies receive additional payments in respect of phased dispensing.  Monitored Dosing Systems are systems that enable the individual medicine doses to be organised according to the prescribed dose schedule. These are sometimes referred to as blister packs. The State has never agreed to fund Monitored Dosing Systems.  However, a practice has built up whereby the use of Monitored Dosing Systems are charged as if for phased dispensing. The State has never agreed to this. Phased claiming was never intended to be used to submit claims in lieu of the provision of Monitored Dosing Systems.  Whilst Monitored Dosing Systems may have a role for some patients there is significant uncertainty around the robustness of the evidence supporting its use. The National Centre for Pharmacoeconomics carried out an evidence assessment which indicated that the evidence was, at best, equivocal to support such a programme.  Significant expenditure is therefore being incurred where it was never intended by the State. It has been agreed to introduce improved controls in this regard and to limit the use of phased dispensing to specified high risk drugs, where a patient safety concern may exist.  Phased dispensing support is currently available under the GMS (medical card) Scheme for the following reasons:  • Reason 1 - at the request of a patient's physician.  • Reason 2 - due to the inherent nature of a medicinal product i.e. product stability and shelf life.  • Reason 3 - where a patient is commencing new drug therapy with a view to establishing patient tolerance and acceptability before continuing on a full treatment regime.  • Reason 4 - in exceptional circumstances where the patient is incapable of safely and effectively managing the medication regimen.  Under the Community Pharmacy Agreement 2025, from January 2026, phased dispensing under reason 1 and 4 will be limited to a defined set of high-risk medication classes. These are:  • Psychotropics;  • Opioids;  • Codeine; and  • Pregabalin and gabapentin.  The approved list of medications under these classes will be provided by the HSE in due course.  For reasons 1 and 4, by focusing phased dispensing reimbursement on the medication categories on the approved list, phased dispensing payments can be targeted to medications with the highest risk or potential for misuse.  Phased dispensing fees will remain payable as per current arrangements under reasons 2 and 3 and will not be subject to the approved list.  The salient point here is that appropriate phased dispensing is not being removed in this Agreement.  The introduction of improved controls around phased dispensing is being done in a way which puts patient safety first and allows the State to repurpose €20m of funding to be used to implement new patient-centered services.  It remains open to pharmacies to charge patients for the use of Monitored Dosing Systems as a private service. ",

        "answerText": " Minister of State at the Department of Justice (Deputy Colm Brophy)  I can advise the Deputy that the visa appeal cited was received on 25 September 2024, and continues to be processed by my Department. Visa appeals are processed in the seven overseas Visa Offices in addition to the Visa Office in Dublin. They are located in Abuja, Beijing, London, Moscow, Ankara, Abu Dhabi and New Delhi.  I can assure the Deputy that while processing times can vary across the different Visa Offices the majority of visa appeals are processed within stated target times. However, some appeals can take considerably longer. Processing times for all appeals are influenced by a number of factors. The time it can take varies depending on the type and complexity of application; individual circumstances; peak application periods; such as holidays or the start of the school year; and, crucially, the quality and completeness of the appeal lodged.  I understand that extended wait times can be frustrating for applicants, and I want to assure anyone who is appealing a visa decision that my Department is doing everything possible to progress these applications as quickly as possible.  The appeals process allows applicants, in the event of a refusal of the application at first instance, to address the factors which gave rise to that decision. All visa applicants are advised that the responsibility is on them to provide as much information in support of their application as they feel is necessary. Guidelines in this regard are posted on my Department's website. People that carefully follow these guidelines have an improved prospect of receiving a positive decision.  When making an appeal, applicants should take into account the reasons for refusal listed in their refusal letters. The appeal should include any further information or additional documentation they wish to have considered. People will find further details on the appeals process at the following link: www.irishimmigration.ie/appeal-a-negative-decision/  In 2024, approximately 6,585 visa appeals, of all types, were received by the Visa Division of my Department. This reflects an increase of 5%, compared to 2023, with over 314 additional appeals received.  In the first eight months of 2025, my Department’s Visa Division issued 3,981 decisions on appeals, this reflects an increase of 25% compared to the same period in 2024.  Visa and preclearance applications provide legal avenues for people moving to Ireland for employment, study and family reasons and also to facilitate visitors who wish to travel for business and/or tourism. It is important to recall these applications are screening processes, designed to establish that the person has a legitimate reason to come to Ireland prior to travel. Verifying an application is an important part of our immigration system and the checks involved can take time to complete.  Processing times and decisions at my Department’s Dublin Visa Office and the seven overseas Visa Offices can be checked at the following link: www.irishimmigration.ie/visa-decisions/#decisions  The date published on the website of the Dublin Visa Office is the oldest date of appeal currently being processed. However, it should be noted that the Visa appeals team continue to process and make decisions on appeals received after the published processing date. If a particular appeal takes longer to consider this may result in the published processing date remaining unchanged. I can assure you that this does not indicate the processing of these appeals has halted overall.  The person concerned can now directly check the status of their visa appeal on the Immigration Service’s Customer Service Portal. They can register for, or log in to their existing account, at:   portal.irishimmigration.ie/en/   As an Oireachtas member, you can also request the status of individual immigration cases by e-mail, using the Oireachtas Mail facility at: IMoireachtasmail@justice.ie, which has been specifically established for this purpose. This service enables up to date information on such cases to be obtained without the need to seek information by way of the Parliamentary Question process. ",

Beneficiaries of Temporary Protection hold temporary permission to remain in Ireland, renewable annually for as long as the Directive remains in force.  On 15 July 2025, the Justice and Home Affairs Council extended Temporary Protection by a year until March 2027, providing certainty for beneficiaries who can continue to avail of the protections that the Directive provides.  In addition, the Government has agreed to opt in to an EU proposal for a Recommendation related to a coordinated exit from Temporary Protection. While not binding, this recommendation outlines a series of measures to pave the way for a smooth and coordinated approach to transitioning out of Temporary Protection for displaced people from Ukraine. It also acknowledges the inherently temporary nature of temporary protection and that it therefore must eventually end.  The proposed recommendation focuses on four sets of measures:  1. Promote and facilitate the transition to other legal statuses before the end of temporary protection;  2. Pave the way for a smooth and sustainable reintegration in Ukraine;  3. Ensure information provision to displaced persons; and  4. Ensure coordination, monitoring and exchange of information among Member States and with the Ukrainian authorities.  On 16 September, the recommendation was adopted by Member States. This recommendation will inform ongoing work across Government on approaches to managing the exit from Temporary Protection. ",

        "answerText": " Minister for Transport  The improvement and maintenance of regional and local roads is the statutory responsibility of each local authority, in accordance with the provisions of Section 13 of the Roads Act 1993. Works on these roads are funded from Councils’ own resources and supplemented by State Road grants. The initial selection and prioritisation of works to be funded is a matter for the local authority.  On 14th February I announced an Exchequer investment of €713 million in our regional and local roads across the State which represents an overall increase of over 8% in funding this year. The main focus of the grants continues to be the protection and renewal of the regional and local road network.  In 2018, the Department introduced ring-fenced funding for Community Involvement Schemes (CIS). The purpose of the CIS is to facilitate local community participation in the repair of local roads. The focus of the programme is on the repair of more lightly trafficked public roads which might not be high on the list of a local authority's annual roadwork programme. Under the scheme a local community can contribute in money or in kind, for example by making labour or machinery available.  While community contributions in the range 15% to 30% had been required up to 2021, depending on the mix between works and monies, the contribution rates were reduced to a minimum of 10% for monetary contributions and 20% for works contribution. In the 2025 circular for applications, local authorities were notified that the contribution rate was reduced to a minimum of 8% for monetary contributions, with the contribution rate remaining at 20% for works contribution. This is more in line with Local Improvement Scheme contribution rates.  In order to allow for sufficient planning and applications for this scheme, local authorities are invited to apply for funding for CIS projects for a two-year programme, with local authorities invited in recent weeks to submit applications in the latest round for the 2026/2027 period.

        "showAs": " 270. Deputy Robert Troy asked the Minister for Social Protection if the income assessment for the non-contributory pension has been increased as part of budget 2026; and his views on whether the assessment should be increased in line with cost-of-living increases. [60608/25] ",
        "questionNumber": 270,
        "answerText": " Minister for Social Protection  The State Pension (Non-Contributory) is a means-tested social assistance payment for people aged 66 and over, habitually residing in the State, who do not qualify for a State Pension (Contributory), or who only qualify for a reduced rate contributory pension based on their social insurance record.  My Department has over 90 schemes of which a significant number are means-tested schemes, each with their own means test, on both a statutory and non-statutory basis.  Social welfare legislation provides that means tests take account of the income and assets of the person (and their spouse or partner, if applicable) applying for the relevant scheme. The means assessment includes income from employment, self-employment, occupational pensions and maintenance payments. It also includes property owned, other than the family home, and capital such as savings, shares, and other investments.  When assessing income from employment for the purpose of State Pension (Non-Contributory), PRSI contributions, pension contributions, trade union subscriptions and the first €200 of weekly earnings are deducted from gross earnings. These deductions are set out in Article 148 of the Social Welfare (Consolidated Claims, Payments and Control) Regulations 2007 (S.I. 142 of 2007) as amended.  There were no changes to these provisions announced as part of the Budget 2026 package. However, the Budget package provided for a general rate increase of €10 across social welfare schemes, effective from January 2026, with proportionate increases for those on means reduced rates in addition to Qualified Adults. This will bring the maximum personal rate of State Pension (Non-Contributory) to €288 per week, a 3.6% increase when consumer prices have increased by 2.7% over the 12 months to September 2025, according to data from the Central Statistics Office (CSO).  This rate increase will allow some individuals, who previously would not have been eligible for State Pension (Non-Contributory) due to their level of weekly means, to receive a means reduced payment. For example, in 2025 an individual with up to €305 of weekly means, as assessed by the Department, would be entitled to a means reduced rate of State Pension (Non-Contributory). This will increase to €315 from January 2026 as a result of the rate increases announced as part of Budget 2026.  Any changes to the means assessment of social assistance schemes would have to be considered in the overall policy and budgetary context.  I trust this clarifies the matter for the Deputy. "
