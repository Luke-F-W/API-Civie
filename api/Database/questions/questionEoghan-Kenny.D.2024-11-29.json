The Programme for Government commits to applying the Dublin City Taskforce model to other cities, towns and regions in need of revitalisation, beginning with Cork City.  Officials from my Department recently met with Cork City Council and representatives from business and the community to exchange ideas on how to proceed with rejuvenating Cork City and share learnings from the Dublin City Taskforce model. In recognising Cork City’s unique character and potential as our second city, the implementation of the Taskforce model will demand a tailored response in line with the specificity of Cork City.  Cork City Council has submitted a proposal for next steps tailored to Cork City’s specific needs and opportunities which, in addition to the Action Plan, are being considered. ",

Applications for social housing support are assessed by the relevant local authority, in accordance with the eligibility and need criteria set down in section 20 of the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2009 and the associated Social Housing Assessment Regulations 2011, as amended.  Where a household is deemed to meet the eligibility criteria, only then is its housing need assessed under the criteria in Regulation 23 of the 2011 Regulations, having regard to its current accommodation. This criteria includes where its accommodation is shared with another household, whether the household that has applied for social housing support has a reasonable requirement for separate accommodation.  Decisions on the qualification of specific persons for social housing support, the most appropriate form of any such support, and the allocation of that support are a matter solely for the local authority concerned.  Details on the number of households qualified for social housing support in each local authority administrative area is provided in the annual statutory Summary of Social Housing Assessments (SSHA).

The Bill will be published as soon as possible and will be subject to debate, and open to amendment, during the legislative process in the Houses of the Oireachtas. ",

Our new housing plan, Delivering Homes, Building Communities commits to a new Starter Homes communications campaign to ensure that everyone has the information they need to understand the range of housing supports and opportunities available.  The Residential Tenancies Board is the independent public body that regulates Ireland’s rental sector. It regularly runs information campaigns for the public. It is planning a campaign on the new rules on rent regulation and security of tenure for new tenancies created from 1st March 2026.  In the interim, information on the Government’s approved new policies which will strengthen rent controls and tenancy protections for new tenancies is available on my Department’s website.  The response to Domestic, Sexual and Gender-Based Violence (DSGBV) is a cross-Departmental and multi-agency issue, with overall policy coordinated by the Department of Justice.  Responsibility for the development and provision of services to support victims rests with the Minister for Justice working in conjunction with Cuan, the statutory DSGBV agency under the remit of the Department of Justice. My Department currently provides capital funding support for the construction of new Domestic Violence Refuges, via the Capital Assistance Scheme.  In 2017, my Department issued policy and procedural guidance to local authorities relating to the role they can play to assist victims of domestic violence. The issuing of this 2017 policy and guidance was a significant action in the second national strategy on DSGBV 2016-2021, and has since played an important role in addressing the housing needs of victims and survivors of DSGBV, providing direction to local authorities in supporting victims of domestic violence. It covers a range of scenarios that may arise for victims of domestic violence currently in receipt of social housing support and those seeking social housing supports. These include provisions around the use of the Housing Assistance Payment scheme, or the Rental Accommodation Scheme, where a victim has a joint interest in the family home, or ownership of alternative accommodation, but would otherwise qualify for social housing support.  In addition to the above supports, a new protocol was established in 2020 when the Minister for Social Protection agreed to make rent supplement more accessible to victims of domestic violence. This measure aims to ensure that they are not prevented from leaving their homes because of financial or accommodation difficulties.  In June, 2022 the Department of Justice published Zero Tolerance, the Third National Strategy on DSGBV 2022-2026. As an action in this strategy, my Department committed to a review of the 2017 Policy and Procedural Guidance for Housing Authorities in relation to assisting victims of domestic violence with emergency and long-term accommodation needs in order to ensure continuing effectiveness and consistency in responses to assist victims of domestic violence.  Work is ongoing on updating the 2017 Guidelines to clarify that housing authorities should support the victim to remain in the home or return to the home wherever possible once it is safe to do so and it is the victim’s preference.

Persons in receipt of Department of Social Protection schemes, including Oner Parent Family Payment, may also have their entitlement reviewed from time to time to ensure they continue to satisfy the conditions.  The One-Parent Family Payment of the person concerned was referred to the Social Welfare Inspector as part of a routine control review in July 2025. Following investigation, the Social Welfare Inspector was not satisfied that the person concerned continued to satisfy the conditions for receipt of the payment. The person did not submit all the necessary information, including bank statements, requested as part of the review. In addition the Social Welfare Inspector was not satisfied that the person had disclosed all of their means.  As a result, the One-Parent Family Payment claim was disallowed from 16/10/2025. The person concerned was informed of this decision in a letter dated 14/10/2025 and advised that, if they were not satisfied with the decision, they could send in any facts or evidence to the Department and a Deciding Officer would review the decision. The person was also advised they could appeal the decision to the Social Welfare Appeals Office, which provides an independent appeals service.  While the person has provided additional information following this disallowance decision of 14/10/25, the specific information requested by the Social Welfare Inspector remains outstanding.  The person has now appealed the decision to disallow the One-Parent Family Payment claim and the case is currently with the Social Welfare Appeals Office. The person will be advised of the outcome in writing.  I understand the person concerned has applied for a Supplementary Welfare Allowance payment, a number of documents are still outstanding in relation to this application. The Community Welfare Service will now contact the person concerned to follow up.  I trust this clarifies the matter for the Deputy. ",

The Programme for Government contains a commitment to publish a National Migration and Integration Strategy detailing how the Government intends to meet the demands and opportunities facing Ireland’s society and economy over the next decade. My Department is currently working with other Government Departments to develop this strategy with the aim to publish it in 2026.  As part of this strategic approach, I am reviewing the area of student permissions, including with regard to English Language students. This work is aimed at ensuring that the system remains robust and rules-based, supports high-quality education providers, and continues to offer a positive experience for genuine students coming to Ireland.  International students from outside the EU/EEA are granted a residence permission on Stamp 2 conditions where they have enrolled on, and commenced a course listed on the Interim List of Eligible Programmes (ILEP), or eligible programmes offered by providers with authorisation to use the new TrustEd Education mark awarded by the Quality and Qualifications Ireland (QQI).  All education providers listed on the ILEP are required to maintain attendance records and this is a key criterion under ILEP. They must have systems in place for the recording of student attendance and clearly outline the rules on punctuality and the related penalties. Such records must be available for inspection by, or submission to, the Immigration Service Delivery (ISD) of my Department at any time.  Any education provider may be subject to unannounced inspections, on-line monitoring, or random spot checks to ensure its compliance with ILEP criteria, and this includes the maintenance of records and reports. These may be requested by ISD at any time and failure to do so can result in the removal of a provider from the ILEP. If a student is expelled, withdraws, or fails to attend a course of education, an ILEP provider is required to notify ISD.  In August 2025, my Department communicated with all ILEP listed English Language providers seeking their formal agreement in respect of data sharing for the purpose of processing student immigration residence permissions. All providers intending to recruit non-EEA national students responded positively.  Providers are required to submit template information on a weekly basis to ISD. This includes data on enrolments, attendance rates and expulsions. All information received from providers is stored on my Department's operating system. In the event that a student is not attending a course of study, or is expelled, ISD will investigate each individual case accordingly.  Once the ILEP is discontinued, only education providers granted authorisation to use the TrustEd Ireland mark provided by QQI will be eligible to recruit non-EU/EEA students to English language programmes, foundation programmes and higher education programmes leading to awards within the National Framework of Qualifications (NFQ).

Most renewals are annual, however, there may be students that were required to register/renew multiple times in the same calendar year, such as English Language students. Therefore, these numbers per year should not be summed to an overall total but rather reflect the number of unique individuals required to register or renew in that calendar year.  Information regarding the educational institution a person is attending, as well as the number of times they register in a particular year, is recorded on each individual person’s file. To desegregate this data in the detailed manner requested by the Deputy would require the manual examination of thousands of registrations.

        "answerText": " Minister of State at the Department of Justice, Home Affairs and Migration  I propose to take Questions Nos. 678, 679, 680 and 681 together.  The Programme for Government contains a commitment to publish a National Migration and Integration Strategy detailing how the Government intends to meet the demands and opportunities facing Ireland’s society and economy over the next decade. My Department is currently working with other Government Departments to develop this strategy with the aim to publish it in 2026.  As part of this strategic approach, I am reviewing the area of student permissions, including with regard to English Language students. This work is aimed at ensuring that the system remains robust and rules-based, supports high-quality education providers, and continues to offer a positive experience for genuine students coming to Ireland.  International students from outside the EU/EEA are granted a residence permission on Stamp 2 conditions where they have enrolled on, and commenced a course listed on the Interim List of Eligible Programmes (ILEP), or eligible programmes offered by providers with authorisation to use the new TrustEd Education mark awarded by the Quality and Qualifications Ireland (QQI).  All education providers listed on the ILEP are required to maintain attendance records and this is a key criterion under ILEP. They must have systems in place for the recording of student attendance and clearly outline the rules on punctuality and the related penalties. Such records must be available for inspection by, or submission to, the Immigration Service Delivery (ISD) of my Department at any time.  Any education provider may be subject to unannounced inspections, on-line monitoring, or random spot checks to ensure its compliance with ILEP criteria, and this includes the maintenance of records and reports. These may be requested by ISD at any time and failure to do so can result in the removal of a provider from the ILEP. If a student is expelled, withdraws, or fails to attend a course of education, an ILEP provider is required to notify ISD.  In August 2025, my Department communicated with all ILEP listed English Language providers seeking their formal agreement in respect of data sharing for the purpose of processing student immigration residence permissions. All providers intending to recruit non-EEA national students responded positively.  Providers are required to submit template information on a weekly basis to ISD. This includes data on enrolments, attendance rates and expulsions. All information received from providers is stored on my Department's operating system. In the event that a student is not attending a course of study, or is expelled, ISD will investigate each individual case accordingly.  Once the ILEP is discontinued, only education providers granted authorisation to use the TrustEd Ireland mark provided by QQI will be eligible to recruit non-EU/EEA students to English language programmes, foundation programmes and higher education programmes leading to awards within the National Framework of Qualifications (NFQ).  The table below details the number of people granted a student immigration residence permission from 2020 to 2024. Figures for 2025 will be available in early 2026.     Year    Number of Stamp 2 Registrations      2020    30,980      2021    28,717      2022    52,845      2023    60,882      2024    60,901     * Figures are correct at time of issue, however, all statistics may be subject to data cleansing  As referenced in previous Parliamentary Questions, these figures reflect the people, or unique individuals, required to register or renew their immigration permission in a calendar year. Most renewals are annual, however, there may be students that were required to register/renew multiple times in the same calendar year, such as English Language students. Therefore, these numbers per year should not be summed to an overall total but rather reflect the number of unique individuals required to register or renew in that calendar year.  Information regarding the educational institution a person is attending, as well as the number of times they register in a particular year, is recorded on each individual person’s file. To desegregate this data in the detailed manner requested by the Deputy would require the manual examination of thousands of registrations. Such an examination would require a disproportionate amount of time to compile and would deflect resources from processing the very significant annual number of applications for first-time registration and immigration permission renewals.

This work is aimed at ensuring that the system remains robust and rules-based, supports high-quality education providers, and continues to offer a positive experience for genuine students coming to Ireland.  At Government level, the administration and management of international student programmes is within the remit of the Department of Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science (DFHERIS), with my Department having responsibility for visa and related residency policies.  I have met recently with the Minister for Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science (DFHERIS), James Lawless, to discuss this work and explore how our departments can continue to collaborate effectively on this work.  Given that this review into student permissions is at its initial stages, there are no current plans for immediate public or sectoral consultation at this juncture. However, my Department will consider its engagement with the English Language sector once more detailed proposals are developed.  I hope to bring forward proposals in this area in the coming months.

        "answerText": " Deputy Eoghan Kenny  I thank the Minister of State, Deputy Michael Moynihan, for securing a school bus for Rahan National School. That is essential, and I thank him for his work. We have worked extremely closely on that school bus. \n An Cathaoirleach Gníomhach (Deputy John Paul O'Shea)  No doubt there will be a list of Members later on. \n Deputy Michael Moynihan  The bus has just come. \n Deputy Eoghan Kenny  I wish to focus on secretaries and caretakers across the country and their pension parity and leave entitlements. \n Deputy Michael Moynihan  I thank the Deputy for his kind comments, although I noted a \"but\" towards the end of them. In recent months, while I have been in this role, I have seen right across the Chamber the commitment to education of all the spokespersons and Members of the House. The Deputy did a huge amount of work in relation to the Rahan school bus. That is what all of us should be doing because the future of our people rests on education and how to get it. We were delighted to work with the Deputy on that matter.  School secretaries and caretakers are at the heart of the school and are the key interface between students, parents, school leaders and other members of teams within schools. They play a pivotal role and should be treated with the same respect as is afforded to all other members of a school's staff. Without them, our schools would be unsustainable. In supporting these vital school staff members, we also support the school community as a whole.  The Department is committed to ensuring that school caretakers will be afforded the opportunity to avail of a similar package which was offered to school secretaries on foot of an agreement reached in the Workplace Relations Commission, WRC, in 2022. My Department has been engaging with Fórsa over the past number of weeks under the auspices of the WRC and with the Department of Public Expenditure, Infrastructure, Public Service Reform and Digitalisation in relation to a number of claims, including a claim for a comparable pension entitlement. The matter has now been referred to the Labour Court and a hearing will take place on 12 January 2026. The parties remain in process and my Department remains committed and ready to engage with Fórsa to reach a resolution on this important matter.  The Deputy will understand that as with any industrial relations process where engagement is sensitive and complex, the matters under discussion are confidential until this process concludes. \n Deputy Eoghan Kenny  The Minister of State said that the same package that was agreed with secretaries will be offered to caretakers. That package is a load of rubbish. I would not even offer it to the caretakers. It is a matter of disrespect. I would not offer it to them.  I know, and the Minister of State knows that I know, about this issue first hand. I live at home with my grandmother, who has been a secretary for nearly 30 years. She is the longest serving staff member at St. Patrick's Boys' National School in Mallow. She will not be entitled to a pension. That is the difficulty. She is 70 years old and does not feel like she can retire because of that income. It is the same for a lot of secretaries and caretakers across the country. The matter has been to the Labour Court and the WRC. What engagement is the Department having with the secretaries and caretakers, and with Fórsa? The Minister of State referred to a possible resolution that the Department will come up with. What is the resolution that the Department is putting forward? \n Deputy Michael Moynihan  To be absolutely fair, a Labour Court hearing will take place on 12 January 2026 and it would be against all procedures for me to come in here and undermine negotiations that are ongoing and the detailed work that is going on. As I said at the outset, I understand the position of the caretakers and secretaries, and I understand the Deputy's person involvement in the issue. I compliment his grandmother and others who have kept education running in many communities. When you walk into a school, the school secretary is the person who knows the heartbeat of the school.  There is engagement between the Department, Fórsa and the Department of public expenditure, as would be the case for any such issue. The matter is before the Labour Court on 12 January, and it is important that we allow the process to continue. The Department very much values caretakers and secretaries across the school system. \n Deputy Eoghan Kenny  I appreciate the Minister of State's response and I am sure that my grandmother would appreciate the kind comments. What we do not want is what happened at the beginning of this academic year, when secretaries and caretakers were outside schools and the Dáil Chamber, protesting for fairness, dignity and respect. That is what this is about. Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael backbenchers were standing outside schools, getting into pictures and showing off that they were in support of secretaries and caretakers. I do not doubt their individual bona fides on the issue but I doubt the commitment of the Government, the Department of Education and Youth and the Department of public expenditure to providing that respect, dignity and equality to those secretaries and caretakers across the country. It is predominantly women who are affected. Those of an older generation are affected. I ask the Minister of State not to let down these secretaries and caretakers. I plead with him. Let this be his involvement in this Department. Let securing respect, dignity and entitlements for all secretaries and caretakers across the country be his legacy in the Department. \n Deputy Michael Moynihan  We in the Department, across the Government and across the House support secretaries and caretakers. Earlier this year when they went as far as industrial action, many people stood with them because they understood and accepted the importance of caretakers and secretaries to school communities. It is important that we give that voice across the House, whether those speaking are in government or in opposition. We must give a voice to the issue because it gives a clear indication to us and the Department of the strength of support that secretaries and caretakers have across the House.  As I said, there is ongoing engagement with the Labour Court at the moment and there will be a hearing on 12 January. I assure the Deputy that we are committed to finding a meaningful resolution and ensuring that the roles of caretakers and secretaries within school communities are appreciated. We understand the importance of them. ",

        "answerText": " Minister for Education and Youth  I should explain that applications relating to the provision of funding for issues relating to an existing school building can fall under a number of different delivery mechanisms including, most frequently, the Summer Works Scheme and the Emergency Works Scheme.  The purpose of the Emergency Works Scheme (EWS) is to provide funding specifically for unforeseen emergencies. It does so by ensuring the availability of funding for urgent works to those schools that are in need of resources as a result of an emergency situation.  An emergency is deemed to be a situation which poses an immediate risk to health, life, property, or the environment, which is sudden, unforeseen and requires immediate action, and in the case of a school, if not corrected would prevent the school or part thereof from opening.  The EWS operates on the basis of the minimal scope of works required to remedy an emergency situation. The EWS usually provides an interim solution until such time as a comprehensive solution can be provided under the Summer Works Scheme (SWS).  The purpose of the Climate Action Summer Works Scheme (CASWS) is to enable individual school authorities to undertake small-scale building works on a devolved basis that, ideally, can be carried out during the summer months or at other times that avoid disrupting the operation of the school. The CASWS operates on a multi-annual basis across a number of categories of works including but not limited to, Electrical Works, Mechanical Works, Roof Works, Windows, Toilets Facilities, Science Labs, External Environment Works etc.  The Climate Action Summer Works Scheme (which was previously named the Summer Works Scheme) places a strong emphasis on sustainability. Schools can now undertake additional measures such as insulation upgrades, LED lighting installation, EV charger provision, bike rack facilities to support active travel and other climate-focused works alongside traditional maintenance.  The recently announced CASWS is currently closed for applications. The EWS is open for applications year-round. It is open to a school to make an application under the most appropriate scheme. ",

        "answerText": " Minister for Education and Youth  Tackling educational disadvantage and helping students reach their full potential is a key priority for me as the Minister for Education and Youth and for Government. Currently, the DEIS programme supports almost 1,200 primary and post-primary schools, reaching approximately 260,000 students, with an annual investment of over €180 million. Budget 2026 allocates an additional €16.5 million in 2026, rising to €48 million in 2027, to support the implementation of the new DEIS Strategy and introduce the DEIS Plus scheme, which will commence in 2026.  A new DEIS Strategy, which will include a DEIS Plus scheme, will be published early in 2026. This strategy will focus on improving the opportunities and achievement levels of children at risk of educational disadvantage, developing more innovative approaches to tackling education disadvantage, and working towards a more flexible system of supports to ensure that a school can receive the right support at the right time.  The DEIS Plus scheme will provide additional support to schools with the highest levels of need, in line with the Government’s commitment. It will target a cohort of schools with high concentrations of children and young people experiencing intergenerational disadvantage where there is a significant gap in outcomes and there are barriers to those children and young people achieving their potential.  Schools will not be required to apply for inclusion in the DEIS Plus scheme. The process to identify schools for inclusion will be evidence-informed, using available data.  The details of the DEIS Plus scheme are currently being finalised within an overall programme of work to tackle educational disadvantage and will be outlined in the new DEIS Strategy. Future allocation of overall resources will be considered within the context of the new DEIS Strategy and the availability of resources. ",

        "answerText": " Minister for Education and Youth  Since 2020, my department has invested over €6 billion in our schools throughout the country under the National Development Plan, involving the completion of over 1,300 school building projects.  In addition, repurposing and optimisation of existing accommodation capacity across the school estate has been a key enabler of timely, local provision of special class capacity in a way that supports best practice in inclusion and integration. Circa 80% of new special classes in 2025/26 are being facilitated in repurposed classroom accommodation.  Government support for this investment, including by way of supplementary capital funding, has delivered real benefits for school communities. Supplementary capital funding of €210 million approved by Government has brought the total capital allocation for 2025 for my department to €1.6 billion.  In July the Government announced a capital allocation of €7.55 billion for the Department of Education and Youth for the period 2026-2030 under the National Development Plan. As part of this NDP allocation my department will place a strong emphasis on provision for children with special educational needs, with a particular focus on meeting annual school place needs. In relation to project rollout for Large-Scale projects and Additional School Accommodation scheme projects, the approach will be to continue to maximise the capacity of the existing school estate as much as possible in the first instance and provide necessary additional capacity through targeted and prioritised project rollout over the course of 2026 to 2030 period to meet the most urgent and prioritised needs.  My department will publish our sectoral NDP Implementation Plans shortly. This plan will optimise outputs from the NDP allocations, with a strong focus on maximising existing school capacity, progressing priority projects where local capacity across schools in the area is insufficient, and ensuring delivery that is affordable, offers value for money, and meets functional needs.  Project timeframes vary considerably in large capital programmes for many reasons, including factors beyond my department’s control, such as the time taken to secure a site or securing relevant statutory permissions including planning consent. The Department also has to manage the rollout of projects within the parameters of its NDP funding.  Delivery of school building projects are managed as effectively as possible, prioritising the most urgent projects where capacity is already fully utilised, and deploying modular accommodation where additional space is needed in the short term.  The current status of all projects is set out under item number ten at the following link [ (www.gov.ie) ]. ?This is updated on a regular basis to reflect project progress through the various stages of capital appraisal, site acquisition, design, tender and construction.?

The National Council for Special Education (NCSE) is undertaking analysis of information provided through the Parents Notify process to plot demand for special class places for the 2026/27 school year. The NCSE will also consider vacant places in existing special classes and places that will become available through the regular transition of children from primary to post-primary schools. Once this analysis is completed the NCSE will be equipped to engage with schools to open new special classes in relevant areas. It is expected that many of these special classes will be sanctioned by 31 December 2025.  The common application system pilot is also ongoing in some areas of the country, running concurrently is the extension of the autism class application trial in the Dublin 15 area. These pilots form an important step towards delivering a more efficient, transparent, and equitable school application process. It will reduce stress for families, ease administrative burdens on schools, while also supporting better planning for school places.  My department and the NCSE are committed to delivering an education system that is of the highest quality and where every child and young person feels valued and is actively supported and nurtured to reach their full potential.

        "answerText": " Minister for Justice, Home Affairs and Migration  The Accommodation Recognition Payment is a tax-free monthly payment available to those providing accommodation to people who arrived in Ireland under the EU Temporary Protection Directive since March 2022. The scheme, which was introduced in July 2022, is provided for under Part 2 of the Civil Law (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2022.  The original scheme termination date was set as 31 March 2023 to align with the duration of temporary protection under Council Directive 2001/55/EC of 20 July 2001, as activated by https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX:32022D0382To date, the scheme has been extended three times to align with previous extensions of the Temporary Protection Directive (TPD), most recently to 31 March 2026. The scheme may be further extended by Ministerial Order, subject to Oireachtas approval and consultation with relevant Ministers.  The monthly contribution rate was originally set at €400 from 4 March 2022. It was then increased to €800 from 1 December 2022 to coincide with the introduction of the ‘Offer a Home’ scheme. The rate was subsequently reduced to €600 from 1 June 2025. This change was one of several measures introduced by my Department to ensure that such temporary and timebound supports for temporary protection beneficiaries from Ukraine are proportionate and equitable.  The future of the ARP will be considered further in the context of the extension of TPD to March 2027 and planning across Government for a coordinated approach to transitioning out of temporary protection having regard to the Council Recommendation of 4 June 2025 in this regard.
