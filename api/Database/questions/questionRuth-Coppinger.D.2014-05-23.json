        "answerText": " The Taoiseach  I propose to take Questions Nos. 1 to 15, inclusive, together.  The Cabinet committee on housing last met yesterday, Monday, 15 December. The committee works to ensure a cross-Government approach to the implementation of our commitments regarding housing policy. This week’s meeting was specifically focused on our homelessness challenge, in particular the national housing plan commitments in this regard, including the development of a homeless prevention framework and a child and family homelessness action plan.  We are making good progress on the delivery of homes to those most in need across the country, with the new housing plan committed to delivering 72,000 social homes over its lifetime. However, as we increase supply, we also recognise that those experiencing, or at risk of, homelessness have a wide and complex variety of needs. We need to ensure that the appropriate services and policies are in place to support them. Housing is our single biggest issue as a country, with profound social and economic consequences. That is why it is at the centre of the Government’s focus.  Along with the largest ever commitment on social housing, the new national housing plan commits to delivering 300,000 new homes, including 90,000 affordable supports to help people who are struggling to have a home of their own. The plan sets out the highest ever commitment of State funding for housing, with €28 billion over the next five years, coupled with additional funding through State vehicles, including the Land Development Agency, the Housing Finance Agency, Home Building Finance Ireland, the First Home Scheme and the Irish Strategic Investment Fund. Housing delivery, along with infrastructure and utility investment to enable delivery at scale, is at the core of the agreed national development plan published in July, and, at €275 billion, the largest ever capital injection in the history of the State.  To build homes at the scale now required, we need improved and more resilient water, energy and transport services. We will see large-scale investment in all of these areas over the coming years. Last month under price review 6, the investment plan for energy infrastructure was finalised, including funding allocations of up to €18 billion to ESB and EirGrid, leveraged by the Government injection of €3.5 billion in equity to these companies. This will enable thousands more homes to be connected to the grid.  We have also published the investment plan for water, which sets out over €12 billion investment in our water infrastructure, the majority of which will support the delivery of our housing targets. In addition, we are tackling barriers to delivery, through the accelerating infrastructure report and action plan, which includes reforms which will support public and private sector delivery of homes at scale.  Housing is at the centre of the State’s investment and focus for the coming years. However, to meet our targets, we will also need significant delivery from the private sector and we have implemented a number of measures and reforms in support of this. We have focused on making apartment delivery more financially viable, reformed our planning process and created a stable policy environment to enable the private sector to deliver at scale.  We are seeing indications now that our measures are beginning to take effect, evidenced by CSO data showing that we have had an increase of almost 30% in homes approved for planning in quarter 3 of this year, in comparison with the same time period last year, with the number of apartments approved up by over 50%. These are clear indications of confidence. Work is under way to zone a significantly higher quantum of land across the country. Now is the time for ambitious execution, and we have set out a clear framework and roadmap for the coming years to do this. I am confident that we can build on our success to date and bring about a very significant scale-up in our delivery of housing over the lifetime of this Government. \n Deputy Séamus McGrath  I thank the Taoiseach. I welcome today's announcement in relation to the vacant property refurbishment grant and the extension of this grant until 2030. This provides important certainty from a policy point of view in relation to vacant properties. We know they are still a very significant challenge. I also welcome the new initiative in relation to the above the shop grant. Up to €140,000, where multiple properties are involved, is potentially available. That is very significant and the fact that it will be available by quarter 1 of the new year is very important. It is important to look at the local authorities and their resourcing in terms of being able to deal with this grant. I ask the Taoiseach to also look at that. We want these grants to be processed in a timely manner so that we can get on with utilising this currently under-occupied space. The resourcing of local authorities is important and I ask the Taoiseach to look at that. \n Deputy Paul McAuliffe  In my constituency between Shanowen Road and Collins Avenue there are proposals to build new apartment developments. While the additional new housing is incredibly welcome, unfortunately the under-utilised industrial estate there is currently occupied by Santry Boxing Club. Would the Taoiseach agree as well as powering ahead with the provision of new housing, Dublin City Council needs to have a more proactive strategy of making land available to sports clubs so they can avail of programmes like the sports capital grant? Santry Boxing Club is an amazing local facility and will be a great facility for those new homes that will be built. As well as enabling new homes, we need to put in place new facilities, and Dublin City Council needs to be more proactive in making land available to sports clubs. \n Deputy Shane Moynihan  As the Taoiseach said, the delivery of housing is the number one priority for this Government. That is why it is strategically important that all sectors of the Government support that aim, namely through the national development plan's transport sectoral plan, which was published recently. In my constituency, which the Taoiseach visited, we see it as one of the fastest-growing constituencies in the country, with large developments like Adamstown and Clonburris flying ahead. In its county development plans, South Dublin County Council is setting very ambitious targets for zoning. The key to enabling this zoning and to enabling delivery of those homes is the deployment and development of DART+ South West as a transport programme, to intensify the capacity on that line, not only benefitting commuters in Dublin Mid-West but also Kildare North, Dublin South-Central and Dublin-Central.  I am asking the Taoiseach for his support to do all we can to prioritise and bring forward, where possible, the delivery of Dart+ South West as a long overdue infrastructure requirement to not only allow catch-up on public transport in my area but also to plan for the future. \n Deputy John Connolly  One of the actions in the recently published housing plan is that the Department will be publishing quarterly and annual performance tables for new-build output versus targets per local authority, thereby ensuring transparency and accountability.  I understand that will commence next June in relation to social housing. We should also provide similar tables in relation to affordable housing. The local authorities should also be assessed on their output of affordable housing. What actions will the Government take with local authorities that are not meeting their housing targets? \n Deputy Ryan O'Meara  Last February the Government announced its intention to remove the requirement for planning permission for log cabins and modular homes in backyard developments. By the end of the Christmas recess, it will be nearly a year since we heard that announcement. One-off houses in rural Ireland can benefit if we allow log cabins and modular homes to be built not just in backyard developments. They are also one of the few affordable houses out there for young people in rural Ireland whom I speak to. I could give numerous examples of log cabins and modular homes across north Tipperary and north-west Kilkenny that are at threat of enforcement proceedings because they do not have planning permission. Enforcement should not be ongoing until we know what these regulations say. In addition, the development contributions for one-off rural houses should be scrapped again. They are simply a privilege for building on your own land. First, will we see these planning regulations that will exempt log cabins? Second, will this go beyond backyard developments and allow them in rural areas? Third, when will we see the regulations? \n An Ceann Comhairle  I call Deputy Ruth Coppinger. One question. \n Deputy Ruth Coppinger  I also send my solidarity to the Jewish community in Sydney following the appalling attack.  I am sure the Taoiseach agrees with me that cities should be liveable and should have culture as well as venues where people can meet, socialise and enjoy themselves. Will the Cabinet committee on housing and local government discuss the issue of The Complex, a very important cultural space in our capital where artists are currently housed but have been given an eviction notice for the middle of January? A protest on this will come to the Dáil tomorrow. I have attended meetings and other get-togethers in The Complex. In fact, it was the venue for the launch of one of the presidential campaigns. Dublin City Council is open to buying The Complex but only if it can be given 80% to 90% of the funding. We need to intervene to buy this for €10 million. It would be €80 million to buy or to build a similar space. \n Deputy Rose Conway-Walsh  I ask the Taoiseach to consider issuing an upfront fund to local authorities, but to Mayo County Council in particular, in order that they can turn around the vacant properties they have without having to go through the bureaucratic nightmare of applying for funding from central government on a house-by-house, unit-by-unit basis. Can the Taoiseach imagine what it is like to be a homeless person in Mayo watching council houses remain empty month after month while nothing is done? I will give him an example from a young mother in my constituency:  I am homeless, living in a friend's house. I've just had my first baby. She's now a month old. She was born at 36 weeks. I've been in and out of hospital the whole of the pregnancy with stress and anxiety. I developed diabetes also. I was rushed to a Dublin hospital for a week from bleeding and pains. I had a terrible experience. A lot of this stress has been brought on because of my homeless situation.  That is the case for many people. \n Deputy Barry Heneghan  I too join in the condolences on the attack that happened on the Jewish community in Australia.  I also support the plea for funding for The Complex.  Regarding the Cabinet committee on housing, across the country AHBs have signed turnkey deals that then collapse. In Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown, there was a recent scheme that had the contract signed, everything was above board, they were all ready and, at the last minute, when they were looking for funding, the Department denied the funding for 40 turnkey units. If we are to bring medium-sized and small developers into the market, this risk cannot be acceptable. We will not get the funding from the funding schemes, and it is putting all the risk on the developers. The homes are built, the deal collapses and the investor walks away. We want these small-scale developers to meet the housing targets. I have hundreds of people in my constituency looking for affordable housing, and this cannot happen. \n Deputy Darren O'Rourke  I want to raise the issue of child homelessness. In October there were 5,274 children in emergency accommodation. More than 150 of those were in my county, Meath. There is an expectation that at Christmas there will be more than 5,000 and that almost 1,000 of those will be in emergency accommodation for their second or third Christmas. Are there specific measures the Government will take in advance of Christmas, now a handful of days away, to minimise the number of children in homelessness this Christmas? \n Deputy Ruairí Ó Murchú  We all know the issue that exists in relation to housing, whether it is homelessness, the lack of supply, those who cannot get houses, whether from a rental point of view or a purchase point of view, and those languishing on social housing lists. However, we also have to look at the issue of estate management. I do not believe the local authorities, like Louth County Council, have the necessary powers when dealing with chaotic tenants. They may need supports, but even beyond that, we have seen outright criminality and drug-dealing. We know that AHBs have greater levels of power even in relation to the nuclear action of eviction. That should be the last thing that is looked at but, at the end of the day, it is a requirement. I have worked alongside the Louth local authority, the Garda and others in dealing with some situations and we have attempted to move people sideways to deal with the issue. Some very good work has been done, but we do not have the necessary tools, and that is the problem. \n Deputy Liam Quaide  One of the most infuriating parts of the housing crisis is the tens of thousands of properties that have been left idle and decaying throughout the country. Youghal's potential to be on a par with Kinsale for economic prosperity and tourism has been thwarted by the epic scale of dereliction that has been allowed to take place there over many years. Likewise, Castlemartyr and Midleton have many prime-location properties left like deserted husks where boutiques could be flourishing or community hubs or accommodation created. In Holland or Germany this would not be tolerated. Landlords would have to sell up or repurpose a vacant property within a reasonable period or face losing it. The Government's softly-softly approach to vacancy and dereliction is clearly not working, and our towns and villages are haunted by this policy failure. We need to see swift direct action by our local authorities with landlords who blight our streets with decaying properties and a much more urgent pursuit of derelict site levies. The collection of derelict site levies by Revenue is welcome, but why is the Government waiting until 2027 to implement this? \n Deputy Peadar Tóibín  The housing crisis has had varied and wide ramifications in Irish society. One of them is a serious fall in the fertility rate in this State. There has been a 30% fall in the number of births annually. There has been a 20,000 fall in the number of births annually since Celtic tiger times. Some 69% of people aged 25 years or under are living with their parents. Well over 40% of adults who are under 30 are living with their parents. That is changing the very nature of Irish society. The ability for adults to form relationships to have children is being deleted for hundreds of thousands of people. This is having massive ramifications. Schools are now noticing that there is a fall in the number of children being enrolled. An unbalanced demographic structure has serious consequences for our workforce and our pensions. Planning, permitting, licensing, tendering and judicial reviews here are among the slowest in the whole of the European Union. While the Taoiseach's Government has announced plans, they are not ambitious enough and I do not believe they will be implemented in a timely fashion. \n The Taoiseach  There were quite a number of questions there, beginning with Deputy Séamus McGrath. I welcome also the good initiative we have announced today, namely the extension of the vacant refurbishment grant to 2030, but specifically on the commercial properties and the €140,000 plus a €5,000 grant for assistance to support the owner to design a project. The Deputy is right in saying that we need to make sure that the local authorities prioritise this - in other words, that they put a project manager or whatever in charge of this operation in the towns and the cities to make this a reality. It needs to be driven with someone who is accountable and who is doing this every single day, in my view. I will talk to the Minister about that.  We need to alert all the business committees in towns and cities because people need to know. If you combine it with the living city initiative, there are real prospects of, once and for all, getting activity in towns and city centres to address dereliction and allow for change of use. Due to changing patterns of trade and so on, many commercial uses are no longer sustainable, so there is an opportunity for increased numbers residential units in towns and cities.  Deputy McAuliffe raised the topic of the Santry Boxing Club. I was recently with the Land Development Agency, LDA, on the southside, where an existing boxing club has been incorporated into a housing development. A new boxing club is being built in the housing development. That is the way to go. Is the local authority involved in the specific development to which the Deputy referred? It is. The local authority should look seriously at that example. Amenities matter in communities and society. They give young people opportunities. It seems to me that some accommodation must be made for Santry Boxing Club. The other example was a good initiative. The name of the boxing club escapes me now, but the people will have a first-class boxing club as a result of the development. It might be a bigger development. In fairness to the LDA, it saw that needed to be done. The Deputy might give me the details.  Deputy Shane Moynihan spoke about the interdependence of the national transport plan in terms of infrastructure and housing delivery. Housing delivery will depend on infrastructure delivery. I am acutely aware of planning considerations. South Dublin County Council is looking at 10,000 to 18,000 new zonings for housing. That will be dependent on DART+ South West. I have had meetings with the Minister for public expenditure and the Minister for climate and transport, Deputy Darragh O'Brien, to ensure we can underpin the development of DART+ South West. We can make progress on that to give the certainty that the council, Deputy Moynihan and the people in the area require.  Deputy Connolly asked about quarterly tables for social housing. He asked about applying such an approach to affordable housing. I will talk to the Minister. It is a fair point. The councils control a bit more for social housing, but outputs should be across the board. The first issue is to highlight those councils that are not performing. It becomes fairly obvious in a league table scenario which councils are not performing. The actions can take a number of forms. We have to work through the actions. There could be disincentives or limited finance. We have to work through that, but there must be consequences or direct action from the State to override councils that are not performing in respect of housing more generally.  Deputy O'Meara spoke about log cabins and modular homes. I hope that the Minister will in February have a list of exempted developments. I understand it has expanded significantly. There have been a lot of submissions from Government Departments and agencies, particularly those with acute issues, including health, for example, where we need urgent public services. The Minister recently indicated to me that it would be February that we will have completion of that. It is fairly complex and much bigger than we originally anticipated.  The rural housing guidelines need to be published. I have asked the Minister to prioritise that. I fully accept what the Deputy is saying about the potential for enabling and helping young people in rural Ireland to afford housing at a reasonable cost when it comes to buying or renting. We will keep an eye on that. We will look at the development levies over time in respect of rural buildings on people's land although services of one kind or another are required.  I fundamentally agree with Deputy Coppinger that cities should be liveable and that there should be strong social support and creative cultural amenities. The Deputy said the local authority is depending on someone else. Other local authorities tend to get on with it and are in a position to facilitate either the acquisition or purchase of a building without having to do the simple equation and getting the Department to pay out for every single acquisition. The Minister for public expenditure has taken an interest in this issue. I will check the current lie of the land in respect of the Complex. I know Deputy Heneghan also raised that issue.  To Deputy Conway-Walsh, I say that there is no reason why voids should take so long. There has to be some framework of control for the Department. We discovered recently with the tenant in situ scheme that houses were being bought with people living in them. Those houses are bought by councils and suddenly there is €80,000 or €100,000 going into the house. The original objective of that was to stop people going into homelessness. When a local authority house becomes vacant, unless there is something majorly wrong structurally, it should be occupied within a month. We have given huge money to local authorities for voids over the past five years. They should get on with it. They let the houses lie idle for too long. It is inexcusable. In some councils, there is inertia. I have seen it. People leave very good houses for one reason or another, the shutters go up and the houses are left there for three or four months. Those houses should be reoccupied once the electrics and everything else are grand. If we have to get around to repairing them, we can at least give someone the house. That is my view. I get impatient about it from time to time, to be honest. I hear what the Deputy is saying. If you give an upfront grant, there is no guarantee it will be spent on voids, and that is the problem.  I do not have the details of the 40-turnkey units to which Deputy Heneghan referred. Are they in Dún Laoghaire? \n Deputy Barry Heneghan  Yes. \n The Taoiseach  Has the Deputy moved across? \n Deputy Barry Heneghan  I am national now. \n The Taoiseach  The Deputy has a wide compass. He is national now. I ask him to give me the details and I will follow through. It should not happen. I do not know the background to that.  I appreciate the Deputy's comments about the Jewish community in Ireland and the impact that what happened in Bondi Beach has had on the Jewish community globally and in Ireland. The murder that took place was quite shocking. Others were injured. The Deputy also referenced the Complex.  Deputy O'Rourke spoke about child homelessness. The meeting of the Cabinet subcommittee on housing yesterday was entirely about different aspects of homelessness. We had good presentation of data. The data illustrates that there is a wide variety of reason why people become homeless. There are different factors. There is a high rate for singles in homelessness as well as children. There are different elements to the issue. An increasing amount of those who leave direct provision end up homeless. Family reunification comes with that. The link between migration and housing has grown, but is not the only factor. Family separation is a factor. Different factors give rise to homelessness, and specifically child homelessness. The Minister has specific measures. He achieved €100 million in the budget to acquire social housing and housing more generally to take more families out of emergency accommodation and get them into either local authority houses or acquired homes. There is a specific programme ahead now.  Have I dealt with everyone? I have not. \n An Ceann Comhairle  Deputies Ó Murchú and Tóibín. \n The Taoiseach  How could I forget Deputy Ó Murchú? He spoke about estate management powers to deal with what he described as \"chaotic tenants\". There are powers. I am not sure that the AHBs have different powers. They just have a different way of operating. \n Deputy Ruairí Ó Murchú  It is about eviction. \n The Taoiseach  They have a different of operating. They lay it down from the beginning. \n Deputy Ruairí Ó Murchú  It is easier for them to evict people. \n The Taoiseach  Local authorities have struggled with this for quite a long time. My own belief is that persistent misbehaviour and so on should mean you lose the tenancy. That is what should happen. It is hard. We know of housing estates that have awful tensions, difficulties and challenges. I would be glad to work with the Deputy on the issue. I will talk to the Minister about it.  Deputy Quaide spoke about the thousands of houses that have been left lying idle. We give responsibilities to the local authorities. Deputy Connolly talked about league tables. There is a league table showing which local authorities did what in respect of derelict sites. It is very telling. There are two or three that did an exceptional job. If they can do it, why cannot others? It begs the question of whether there is, or has been historically, inertia in local authorities about the Derelict Sites Act. Revenue will now be charged with it. That will bring about a change and better behaviour. The reason for the length of time, and I hope it can be accelerated, is the mapping. I have challenged officials from the Department of Finance and Revenue about this issue. I have asked why the maps are not there already and why they would take so long. Apparently, at the time of the land tax and others, the mapping was not as comprehensive as people would have expected.  That is the issue there. I think it is a game-changer and will be a game-changer.  Deputy Tóibín is making a link between falling fertility and the housing issue. Again, there are a number of variables, I imagine, responsible for that. The bottom line is we do need to provide more housing more quickly to as many young people as possible. It is a social need. Every young person in the country has a right to aspire to owning a home, and many do aspire to owning a home, or some young families being able to rent a home at an affordable cost. We are building substantially more houses than we did five years ago. We are doing about 30,000 odd now compared to 20,000 in 2020. We need to go to 50,000 and we need all hands on deck in that respect. I do not think enrolments are going down in schools yet, I think they are going up. \n Deputy Peadar Tóibín  They are; 30 schools are falling this year. And childcare. ",

        "answerText": " The Taoiseach  I propose to take Questions Nos. 16 to 24, inclusive, together.  I attended the leaders’ summit at COP30 in Belém, Brazil, on 6 and 7 November. Coming a decade after the Paris Agreement and during a period of enhanced geopolitical turbulence, my attendance at the summit was an important opportunity to show Ireland’s continuing commitment to the objectives of the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change and the Paris Agreement to limit emissions in order to avoid the worst impacts of climate change. I delivered Ireland’s national statement on 6 November, highlighting the reality that climate change is no longer a distant threat and pointing to the remarkable litany of record-breaking climate events in the 12 months since COP29 in Azerbaijan, including Storm Éowyn which brought the strongest wind gusts ever recorded in Ireland and the highest storm surges on the western seaboard. We saw the damage that Storm Bram caused last week to counties all over the country. I also argued that the sharpest impacts of climate change are felt by the world’s most vulnerable people and countries and noted that no country can successfully address the crisis of climate change alone.  I participated in two thematic round tables with my fellow leaders to discuss climate issues of common concern. The first focused on \"Climate and Nature: Forests and Oceans\". I reiterated Ireland’s strong support for the agreement reached at COP15 to protect at least 30% of land and oceans by 2030. The second thematic session took the form of a panel discussion on \"Energy transition and ten years of the Paris Agreement: NDCs and financing\". I expressed Ireland’s commitment to ensuring a just and inclusive energy transition pathway for all nations. I also shared Ireland’s focus on accelerating the delivery of renewable generation. I also participated in a small round table hosted by President Lula da Silva and attended also by the United Nations Secretary General, António Guterres, on climate adaptation and resilience. I spoke of Ireland’s commitment in this area with 80% of our climate finance concentrated on adaptation.  I also attended an event launching the Tropical Forest Forever Fund, hosted by President Lula. This global initiative aims to finance the conservation of tropical forests. I reaffirmed Ireland’s commitment to the preservation and sustainable use of the Amazon rainforest. I announced Ireland’s commitment to provide €15 million over the next three years to the Amazon fund, with the aim of preventing and combating deforestation.  While in Belém, I also took the opportunity to visit the offices of the United Nations High Commission for Refugees, where I met with representatives of some of the refugees they work with, including indigenous people from the Amazon displaced by climate change. To date in 2025, Ireland has provided over €25.5 million in funding to UNHCR. \n Deputy Malcolm Byrne  I welcome the fact that the Taoiseach attended the COP in Brazil as head of Government. It is appropriate that he did so. I welcome his remarks while there. I ask the Taoiseach to consider that Ireland might consider hosting a future COP to raise awareness of the important issues he has outlined.  I do want to express concern that if we are going to reduce our own dependence on fossil fuels and get people out of cars, we have to provide them with a realistic public transport alternative. I am passionate about rail travel but unfortunately the M11 is increasingly becoming a car park every morning. The problem for those travelling along the M11 into the capital, unlike a number of other commuter routes, is that we do not have a realistic rail alternative. We have fewer services, worse rolling stock and more overcrowding than any other rail service. What particularly annoys me is the fact that yesterday, the rail project prioritisation strategy made no commitments whatsoever about improvements for the Rosslare rail line and further looked at abandoning the proposals to develop and reopen the Rosslare to Waterford rail line. If we are to provide a real alternative and reduce our dependence on fossil fuels and car use, there has to be a real public transport alternative. I want assurances that the Department of Transport has not abandoned the rail commuters along the Rosslare rail line. \n Deputy Naoise Ó Cearúil  I note that, following the Taoiseach's attendance at COP in Belém, the EU made a significant decision to permanently stop Russian gas imports and phase out Russian oil. Similar to Deputy Byrne, I wish to highlight the issue of reducing our reliance on fossil fuels in the context of significant investment in public transport, in terms of DART+ West, for example, going to Maynooth and then Kilcock. The prioritisation of DART+ South West was not announced. There is significant traffic and build-up on the N7, M7, N4 and M4, particularly the N7 coming from Naas, Sallins and Celbridge. Indeed, Deputy Shane Moynihan has raised it previously. We need to ensure that these key pieces of infrastructure are prioritised along the commuter line that is causing the greatest amount of traffic. \n Deputy Darren O'Rourke  One of the most effective ways we can reduce emissions is by encouraging people on to public transport. I want to raise the lack of public transport in Bellewstown, County Meath. A 13-year-old boy, James Black, has started a campaign there and has hundreds of petition signatures calling for a public bus services for the village of Bellewstown. Fair play and well done to him for that. He has got an amount of media attention about it. He is very articulate and very clear in what he is trying to achieve.  The connecting Ireland scheme in the Department of Transport is a very good one but it is underfunded and Bellewstown is not included in it. Will the Taoiseach increase funding to the connecting Ireland scheme and will he include Bellewstown, County Meath in it? \n Deputy Liam Quaide  We heard a lot during the last Government about how much more investment went into the National Parks and Wildlife Service but in east Cork and Waterford, the level of under-resourcing has been baffling. In east Cork, we have had no ranger for approximately 12 of the last 15 years. There has been no district conservation officer for 18 months and no regional manager in place for years over east Cork and Waterford. It is difficult to give precise figures for these vacancies, because the Department has been incredibly opaque in response to questions I have submitted on recruitment to the NPWS. In one response, the Minister referred to \"perceived vacancies\", as if we were all imagining those roles being vacant. Also, bizarrely, the Department will not give details of staffing by geographical area for \"operational security reasons\". This is akin to An Garda Síochána not sharing numbers of gardaí employed in a given division. The Department also will not give any information on recruitment campaigns being undertaken. Meanwhile, hedgerows and trees are being trashed with impunity and the whole idea of habitat protection looks more like a bad joke in this country. When are we going to see more transparency from the Department of heritage on staffing of the NPWS? When are we going to see those crucial roles in east Cork and Waterford filled? \n Deputy Peadar Tóibín  Today the Minister of State, Deputy Thomas Byrne, stated that the Mercosur deal held many benefits for the Irish farmers and the wider economy. He said that for Ireland, Mercosur could be a significant beneficiary. This is incredible. It is the Minister of State putting up the white flag of surrender in terms of Mercosur. It comes just a few days after the Government put up the white flag in terms of the Irish fishing industry. Make no mistake about it, the Mercosur trade agreement will damage the livelihoods of hundreds of thousands of farmers in this country. All the fine words about COP mean nothing if we are going to facilitate or allow Mercosur to go through. It beggars belief that at a time of climate crisis, we will be bringing in Brazilian beef, which is produced in an environmentally unfriendly way, by which forests are burnt down and land is overgrazed, not to mention the environmental cost of transporting all that beef from South America to Europe. Will the Government stop speaking from both sides of its mouth in terms of Mercosur? \n Deputy Ruairí Ó Murchú  It is difficult to believe that we are talking about rail services being cancelled. These are proposed new services that make complete sense because we want people to move to public transport. We know the advantages that exist in that regard. One of the new rail services that was being proposed between Clongriffin and Drogheda has been mothballed. This would have allowed for further express services to Dundalk, Drogheda, Newry and Belfast. Such services are absolutely necessary because they are allowed to skip slower services. What is happening does not make any sense at this point. Will the Taoiseach seek some clarity in respect of this matter? I other colleagues in expressing absolute anger if this is the road we are going to take. No pun intended. \n The Taoiseach  I thank Deputy Byrne for acknowledging that it was important to attend the COP, even though it was a long distance to go. We needed to send a signal given that we are at a point at which the issue of climate change is receding in terms of political prioritisation. This is a real concern. Some people are pulling back from their commitments.  On hosting a future COP in Ireland, next autumn we will have the largest ever political meeting held in Ireland. There will be over 40 states represented. It is a ginormous undertaking to host a COP, but it is something the country should aspire to do in the future. It depends on the shape and nature of a COP. In some ways it has become very big. Maybe it is has gone too far in some respects in the context of how it has evolved. We need to get back to the more fundamental origin and idea around COP, which was countries coming together to make decisions on global agreements in respect of sustainability, the future of the planet and the impact of climate change.  I will look at the matter of rail project prioritisation. I take on board what the Deputy said. We have a lot of projects that are needed. We do not have commensurate capital, but I will have a look at where the Rosslare railway line is. We put a lot of money into Rosslare on the custom side and all of that in the context of Brexit. We did it in double-quick time. Rosslare to Waterford is an important link. I will have a look at that to see what we can do and where we are. \n Deputy Malcolm Byrne  There is nothing on the roster----- \n An Ceann Comhairle  This is not a back-and-forth. \n The Taoiseach  I said I am going to have a look at it. The Deputy asked me to have a look at it, so I am telling him that I am going to have a look at it.  Deputy Ó Cearúil is correct on the moves we made in terms of dependency on Russian oil and gas. On public transport, it is key. I have spoken to the Ministers for public expenditure and Transport in respect of DART+ South West. That has gone through all the planning and is shovel ready. The county council has zonings for between 10,000 to 18,000 houses. It feels that this is essential infrastructure. I am seeing if we can do something to make that we progress the project. That is work I am engaged in at the moment with the relevant Ministers.  Deputy O'Rourke referred to public transport more generally and to a young person named James Black. I pay tribute to him for his civic initiative, participation and being involved in something like that in terms of public service for Bellewstown. I will talk to the Minister and make him aware of that. On Connecting Ireland, I take on board the Deputy's views.  Deputy Quaide referred to the National Parks and Wildlife Service, NPWS. There has been huge investment in recruitment. The investment in the NPWS has more or less doubled since 2020. I took a personal interest in this. I worked previous with the then Minister, Malcolm Noonan, on it and continue to work on it with the Minister of State, Deputy Christopher O'Sullivan. Recently, we announced a €700,000 lifeline for Fota Wildlife Park through the NPWS because of the understanding work that Fota does in respect of conservation of particular species and so forth. I will engage with NPWS in respect of the issues the Deputy has raised to see if we can throw some light on the situation.  Deputy Tóibín referred to Mercosur. There was no agreement on that. It was not put to COREPER last Friday. I do not have the up-to-date information, but it seems unlikely now that it will put before COREPER before Christmas. What we have undertaken to do is work with like-minded countries, particularly France and Italy----- \n Deputy Peadar Tóibín  What is our position? \n The Taoiseach  -----in terms of securing additional safeguards. Quite a significant number of safeguards have been secured. That is contrary to what was there a year ago. They are taking the form of legal instruments that the Commission has committed to.  We succeeded in securing the nitrates derogation. It is a significant advancement that we now have that for a further three years. It was challenging and difficult. We worked hard with the Commission to get it over the line. Approximately 200,000 tonnes of Mercosur beef come into Europe on an annual basis as it stands. The new initiative under Mercosur would allow 99,000 of those to be brought in under a reduced tariff preference. The Minister of State, Deputy Thomas Byrne, spoke about the wider issues around Mercosur. All trade agreements bring benefits and losses. There is no any heresy in saying that. The Canada deal was tremendous for Ireland in terms of the increased exports for SMEs and so on. I accept that every agreement is different. At the moment, there is no sense of any breakthrough or agreement in respect of Mercosur. That is where we are at present.  Deputy Ó Murchú referred to the Clongriffin to Drogheda service. Capital is not limitlessness. \n Deputy Ruairí Ó Murchú  I get that. I was just wondering. \n The Taoiseach  If we were to add up the figures from everybody's contributions, I would guess that we would arrive at another €50 billion. We have to try keep things moving with planning in the context of progressing as many projects as we possibly can and to make sure that we have sustainability, financing and all of that. I will have to look at the rail prioritisation strategy that emerged on Friday. \n An Ceann Comhairle  I thank the Taoiseach. ",

        "answerText": " Minister for Health  I propose to take Questions Nos. 944 to 946, inclusive, together.  As per European legislation – and as transposed into Irish law through the European Communities (Quality and Safety of Human Tissues and Cells) Regulations 2006 – patients undergoing advanced fertility treatment such as IVF (in-vitro fertilisation) and ICSI (intra-cytoplasmic sperm injection) are required to undergo viral screening. This mandatory requirement screen bloods for the presence of HIV (human immunodeficiency viruses) 1 & 2, hepatitis B core antibody and surface antigen, hepatitis C and syphilis. Section 2.3 of Schedule 3 of the 2006 Regulations states: “Where HIV 1 and 2, hepatitis B or hepatitis C test results are positive or unavailable, or where the donor is known to be a source of infection risk, a system of separate storage must be devised”. The Health Products Regulatory Authority (HPRA) holds responsibility for ensuring compliance with the 2006 Regulations; however, neither I, as Minister for Health, nor the HPRA has the power to direct private assisted human reproduction (AHR) providers operating in this country to put in place the necessary facilities and systems to cater for prospective patients who have, for example, tested positive for HIV or hepatitis C.  The Model of Care for Fertility was developed by the Department of Health in conjunction with the Health Service Executive (HSE)’s National Women & Infants Health Programme (NWIHP) in order to ensure that fertility-related issues are addressed through the public health system at the lowest level of clinical intervention necessary.  This Model of Care comprises three stages, starting in primary care (i.e., GPs) and extending into secondary care (i.e., the six Regional Fertility Hubs located across the country) and then, where necessary, AHR (assisted human reproduction) treatment (e.g., IVF, ICSI and IUI (intrauterine insemination)), with patients being referred onwards through structured pathways.  Phase One of the roll-out of the Model of Care involved the establishment, at secondary care level, of six Regional Fertility Hubs within maternity networks covering the entire country, in order to facilitate the management of a significant proportion of patients presenting with fertility-related issues at this level of intervention. Patients are referred by their GPs to their local Regional Fertility Hub.  The Regional Fertility Hubs offer patients who are experiencing challenges with their fertility both medical and surgical interventions, including: relevant blood tests, semen analysis, assessment of tubal patency, hysteroscopy, laparoscopy, fertility-related surgeries, ovulation induction and follicle tracking, so as to assist achieve natural conception. However, if all available services at secondary level care are exhausted, reproductive specialist consultants can refer clinically-indicated patients who meet the eligibility criteria for specialist AHR services such as IVF.  As part of the final phase of the roll-out of the Model of Care for Fertility, referrals for AHR treatment by one of eight HSE-approved private providers, as chosen by the eligible patient concerned, commenced in September 2023. As well as IVF and ICSI, the funding allocated is also being used to provide IUI, which can, for certain cohorts of patients, be a potentially effective, yet less complex and less intrusive treatment.  It is important to ensure that patients are clinically determined by a consultant in a Regional Fertility Hub for IVF, ICSI or IUI before being referred for such treatment, having undertaken at the Hub, as appropriate, extensive consultation, assessment, and the types of procedures and interventions outlined above which are available at the secondary care level. In this regard, numerous patients have had their fertility-related issues resolved through the six Regional Fertility Hubs without having to undergo what can be highly invasive and gruelling AHR treatment such as IVF or ICSI.  In relation to the management and care of public patients who are HIV+ and/or hepatitis C+, within the pool of the eight private AHR providers, the HSE has informed my officials that there is a small number of providers who are currently positioned to manage such cases. If alternative advanced treatment such as IVF or ICSI is required, in which the gametes (egg or sperm) of the patients are handled and managed as part of the care, no AHR provider in Ireland is currently positioned to offer care if either the female or male is HIV+ and/or hepatitis C+.  Any couple identified at Regional Fertility Hub level, in which one or both partners are living with the aforementioned viruses, who have been clinically determined as requiring AHR treatment, meet the national access criteria, and cannot be managed and cared for within the current network of HSE-approved providers will be able to receive their treatment under the HSE’s Treatment Abroad Scheme (TAS). The relevant Regional Fertility Hub, NWIHP and the TAS will work closely together in relation to meeting the needs of individual couples in this regard.  The first public AHR Centre has opened in Cork, with the first IUI treatment having been provided in early December. NWIHP is currently working with the Cork AHR team with a view to developing in the first instance an IUI service that can manage patients living with HIV or hepatitis C. This service is being developed in close collaboration with the infectious disease services and will involve the development of a joint package of care, such that a couple requiring IUI treatment can receive it in time in the Cork AHR Centre and will no longer have to travel abroad. With the planned development and delivery of further advanced treatments in Cork, such as IVF, again NWIHP is working with the Cork team to assess the ability and feasibility of providing those services to patients living with HIV or hepatitis C, thereby removing the need for any couples to travel abroad for treatment.  Whilst this work is ongoing, with a view to ultimately positioning the public service to meet the needs of individuals living with HIV or hepatitis C in relation to the provision of advanced fertility treatment, it is important to note that no patient is being denied treatment. AHR treatment, if indicated, can and will be enabled by the HSE and its Treatment Abroad Scheme.  In conclusion, the Department of Health and the Government have been focused, through the full implementation of the Model of Care for Fertility, on ensuring that patients receive care at the appropriate level of clinical intervention and then those requiring, and eligible for, advanced AHR treatment such as IVF will be able to access same through the public health system.

        "answerText": " Minister for Health  I propose to take Questions Nos. 944 to 946, inclusive, together.  As per European legislation – and as transposed into Irish law through the European Communities (Quality and Safety of Human Tissues and Cells) Regulations 2006 – patients undergoing advanced fertility treatment such as IVF (in-vitro fertilisation) and ICSI (intra-cytoplasmic sperm injection) are required to undergo viral screening. This mandatory requirement screen bloods for the presence of HIV (human immunodeficiency viruses) 1 & 2, hepatitis B core antibody and surface antigen, hepatitis C and syphilis. Section 2.3 of Schedule 3 of the 2006 Regulations states: “Where HIV 1 and 2, hepatitis B or hepatitis C test results are positive or unavailable, or where the donor is known to be a source of infection risk, a system of separate storage must be devised”. The Health Products Regulatory Authority (HPRA) holds responsibility for ensuring compliance with the 2006 Regulations; however, neither I, as Minister for Health, nor the HPRA has the power to direct private assisted human reproduction (AHR) providers operating in this country to put in place the necessary facilities and systems to cater for prospective patients who have, for example, tested positive for HIV or hepatitis C.  The Model of Care for Fertility was developed by the Department of Health in conjunction with the Health Service Executive (HSE)’s National Women & Infants Health Programme (NWIHP) in order to ensure that fertility-related issues are addressed through the public health system at the lowest level of clinical intervention necessary.  This Model of Care comprises three stages, starting in primary care (i.e., GPs) and extending into secondary care (i.e., the six Regional Fertility Hubs located across the country) and then, where necessary, AHR (assisted human reproduction) treatment (e.g., IVF, ICSI and IUI (intrauterine insemination)), with patients being referred onwards through structured pathways.  Phase One of the roll-out of the Model of Care involved the establishment, at secondary care level, of six Regional Fertility Hubs within maternity networks covering the entire country, in order to facilitate the management of a significant proportion of patients presenting with fertility-related issues at this level of intervention. Patients are referred by their GPs to their local Regional Fertility Hub.  The Regional Fertility Hubs offer patients who are experiencing challenges with their fertility both medical and surgical interventions, including: relevant blood tests, semen analysis, assessment of tubal patency, hysteroscopy, laparoscopy, fertility-related surgeries, ovulation induction and follicle tracking, so as to assist achieve natural conception. However, if all available services at secondary level care are exhausted, reproductive specialist consultants can refer clinically-indicated patients who meet the eligibility criteria for specialist AHR services such as IVF.  As part of the final phase of the roll-out of the Model of Care for Fertility, referrals for AHR treatment by one of eight HSE-approved private providers, as chosen by the eligible patient concerned, commenced in September 2023. As well as IVF and ICSI, the funding allocated is also being used to provide IUI, which can, for certain cohorts of patients, be a potentially effective, yet less complex and less intrusive treatment.  It is important to ensure that patients are clinically determined by a consultant in a Regional Fertility Hub for IVF, ICSI or IUI before being referred for such treatment, having undertaken at the Hub, as appropriate, extensive consultation, assessment, and the types of procedures and interventions outlined above which are available at the secondary care level. In this regard, numerous patients have had their fertility-related issues resolved through the six Regional Fertility Hubs without having to undergo what can be highly invasive and gruelling AHR treatment such as IVF or ICSI.  In relation to the management and care of public patients who are HIV+ and/or hepatitis C+, within the pool of the eight private AHR providers, the HSE has informed my officials that there is a small number of providers who are currently positioned to manage such cases. If alternative advanced treatment such as IVF or ICSI is required, in which the gametes (egg or sperm) of the patients are handled and managed as part of the care, no AHR provider in Ireland is currently positioned to offer care if either the female or male is HIV+ and/or hepatitis C+.  Any couple identified at Regional Fertility Hub level, in which one or both partners are living with the aforementioned viruses, who have been clinically determined as requiring AHR treatment, meet the national access criteria, and cannot be managed and cared for within the current network of HSE-approved providers will be able to receive their treatment under the HSE’s Treatment Abroad Scheme (TAS). The relevant Regional Fertility Hub, NWIHP and the TAS will work closely together in relation to meeting the needs of individual couples in this regard.  The first public AHR Centre has opened in Cork, with the first IUI treatment having been provided in early December. NWIHP is currently working with the Cork AHR team with a view to developing in the first instance an IUI service that can manage patients living with HIV or hepatitis C. This service is being developed in close collaboration with the infectious disease services and will involve the development of a joint package of care, such that a couple requiring IUI treatment can receive it in time in the Cork AHR Centre and will no longer have to travel abroad. With the planned development and delivery of further advanced treatments in Cork, such as IVF, again NWIHP is working with the Cork team to assess the ability and feasibility of providing those services to patients living with HIV or hepatitis C, thereby removing the need for any couples to travel abroad for treatment.  Whilst this work is ongoing, with a view to ultimately positioning the public service to meet the needs of individuals living with HIV or hepatitis C in relation to the provision of advanced fertility treatment, it is important to note that no patient is being denied treatment. AHR treatment, if indicated, can and will be enabled by the HSE and its Treatment Abroad Scheme.  In conclusion, the Department of Health and the Government have been focused, through the full implementation of the Model of Care for Fertility, on ensuring that patients receive care at the appropriate level of clinical intervention and then those requiring, and eligible for, advanced AHR treatment such as IVF will be able to access same through the public health system.

The following points should be noted:  • The submission of a business case does not guarantee that an application will be expedited.  • A separate business case is required for each individual application.  To further support applicants and reduce the need for individual status queries, the Department has this year introduced a Self-Service Portal. This system allows both employers and applicants to check the real-time status of their applications directly.  These tools are designed to provide timely updates and reduce the need for individual queries, helping the unit to focus resources on processing applications efficiently.  In addition, a dedicated TD mailbox is available for Oireachtas members to raise queries where appropriate – [ tdepqueries@enterprise.gov.ie ]  The Department remains committed to allocating resources where they are most needed — namely, in the processing of applications to ensure that all applicants are treated fairly and that overall timelines are kept to a minimum.

        "answerText": " The Taoiseach  I propose to take Questions Nos. 1 to 11, inclusive, together.  The Government is committed to the delivery of a national security strategy and work is ongoing in finalising the strategy, co-ordinated by the national security secretariat in my Department and integrating inputs from a range of relevant stakeholders, including the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, the Department of Defence, the Department of Justice, Home Affairs and Migration, An Garda Síochána, the Defence Forces and the National Cybersecurity Centre.  The programme for Government, securing Ireland's future sets out a number of national security commitments, acknowledging that this is a time of upheaval, in particular geopolitical upheaval, with threats and challenges arising from a rapidly changing global geopolitical landscape. The preparation of a draft strategy covers a broad range of national security issues. There is necessarily a focus on the State’s internal security, including the evolving challenges we face from terrorism and extremism and from cyber threats, and a focus on the need to increase our investment in security and to modernise our legislation in the security field, notably in the investigatory powers available to our services. It will include also the implications of recent security, defence and international developments and their related impacts, notably the deteriorating security situation in Europe given Russia's ongoing war in Ukraine and the growth in cyber and hybrid threats in Europe. It will combine an enhanced maritime domain awareness with a prioritised focus on ensuring protection of critical maritime infrastructure, especially critical undersea infrastructure. The ongoing implementation of the report of the Commission on the Defence Forces and the modernisation of aspects of our defence legislation is also included in the preparations.  The National Cyber Security Centre has been placed under the remit of the Minister for Justice, Home Affairs and Migration. This is an important element of the realignment of our national security infrastructure, and a project has been initiated to establish this new statutory national security authority, led by the Department of Justice, Home Affairs and Migration. Earlier this year, I established the Ministerial Council on National Security, which comprises me as chair, the Tánaiste, the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade and for Defence, and the Minister for Justice, Home Affairs and Migration. The council will ensure that at the highest level there is a structured, ongoing review of our strategic national security interests and systematised monitoring of progress on delivering the Government’s commitments over the coming months, including the finalisation of the draft national security strategy. \n Deputy Tom Brabazon  As the Taoiseach is aware, drone sightings in Dublin Bay during the recent Zelenskyy visit underline and underscore the scale of our vulnerabilities and the urgency and need for preparing a strategic national security package. There are reports that international anti-drone units were deployed to Dublin during the visit to assist the emergency response unit. While we welcome the assistance of other states, we should not have to rely on others for our own defence. We should be self-reliant in the first instance. It should be expected that such activity will continue when Ireland takes over the EU Presidency next year, and a national security strategy would allow us to assess risks facing the State, including emergency aerial and technological threats, and set clear goals to guide Government and law makers. Can the Taoiseach provide an update to the House on the development of Ireland's national security strategy and an update on the drone sightings during the Zelenskyy visit? \n Deputy Albert Dolan  When we are talking about national security, it is vital we also give people confidence at a local level in our local security, particularly with regard to An Garda Síochána. In Galway East we have towns that are booming, thriving and growing such as Gort, Loughrea, Tuam and Athenry. Those towns are all feeding into Galway city. They have seen massive population increases and for those people to feel secure in those towns, we need an increase in our gardaí allocation and our gardaí numbers. More importantly, as the populations continue to grow in these towns, we need gardaí that become community gardaí, that the people know and connect with and can build relationships with into the future. These gardaí will serve the area. Our gardaí on the ground right now are working really hard but they need to be supported to handle the large caseloads right across the country but particularly in Galway East, we need additional gardaí. \n Deputy Paul Murphy  Does the Taoiseach think there is any national security implications for the significant decline in basic civil liberties that is happening in Britain, such as the proscription of organisations of Palestine protestors like Palestine Action, the denial of the right to a jury in the vast majority of trials and what is happening with the Palestine protesters who are charged with nothing more than property damage and who have been held for over a year without trial and without access to bail? The consequence is there are now eight protesters on hunger strike for over 30 days. This is the longest, most significant hunger strike since the H-block hunger strikers. Their demands are minimal, namely, the right to a fair trial, the right to access bail, the right to access medical care in prison and for the ending of the proscription of Palestine Action. There is an almost total media blackout on this in Britain, leading people to suspect there is a so-called D-notice in relation to this. Is the Taoiseach concerned about the decline of civil liberties and the fact that people are forced to go on hunger strike in Britain? \n Deputy Ryan O'Meara  Next year we will hold the Presidency of Europe. During that time, as the Taoiseach is more than aware, our national security will be of paramount importance. Given what has happened with drone activity and interference in Denmark, there is a fear the same will happen in Ireland. With President Zelenskyy's visit last week, we saw drones off the coast of Dublin. It is one thing for us to be a militarily neutral country, and that is right, but it is another thing for us to be able to say whether we can patrol our own skies and protect our own airspace. In light of the Presidency coming up in the middle part of next year, what will our national security strategy do? When will we see it? What will be in it regarding the protection of our skies and airports from rogue actors operating drones? \n Deputy Rose Conway-Walsh  The very serious incident of five drones endeavouring to intercept the plane carrying President Zelenskyy last week brought our unpreparedness on defence and national security into sharp focus. Was the C70 form completed to ensure that a Garda defence co-ordinated response was put in place? Were all protocols followed? Why did the navy ship not have drone-disabling equipment? Why were airlines not informed that there was drone activity in the vicinity into which they were flying?  Lieutenant General Rossa Mulcahy told John Mooney of The Sunday Times that the military needs more personnel, intelligence and high-tech capabilities to navigate these uncertain times. Why is the Taoiseach so reluctant to allow the defence and national security committee to do what its title suggests and have oversight of national security? \n Deputy Peadar Tóibín  Can the Taoiseach categorically say that the Government is able to protect all of the EU leaders who will come to this country during the EU Presidency? Who launched the drones that were seen off Dublin Bay during the Zelenskyy visit? Why were those drones not dealt with? Where did these drones come from? Where did they retreat to? How come none of that information is known at this stage? Who was behind the drones? We have heard statements that it is likely that they may have come from Russia, but what evidence is there of this? One of the more memorable answers the Taoiseach gave to a question on national security in the previous Dáil, when the issue of the so-called Russian spy was discussed, was that he did not receive those briefings. He quite pointedly said he did not receive the information he should be receiving on that. How can people in Ireland have confidence, given the fact that our Defence Forces have been run down for so long and we can only staff one ship on the seas at any given time? \n Deputy Paul Lawless  The national security strategy consultation launched in 2019 was intended to guide our strategy on security for the past five years, from 2020-25. Despite this, no strategy was published during this timeframe. During that timeframe we had a huge ransomware attack on the HSE which put a significant number of people's lives and health in jeopardy and cost the State several million euro. What is happening on this? When will the strategy be published? It is costing the State a significant amount of money. \n Deputy Ruairí Ó Murchú  We need some sort of detail and we need to know there is a plan to address cybersecurity and hybrid warfare. The HSE attack brought to light what was probably happening to a lot of businesses which did not provide information. There has been increased funding for the National Cyber Security Centre, NCSC, but we need to get down to brass tacks. There have been drone attacks over the past while and we need to make sure that we have the capacity and technological know-how to be able to deal with these issues. There has been a failure to date in respect of funding to ensure we have the full capacity required. \n Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett  One of the biggest atrocities and national security breaches was the Dublin-Monaghan bombing carried out by the Glenanne gang. There were headlines yesterday stating that there was no collusion in the Dublin-Monaghan bombing. First, the Kenova report yesterday dealt with Stakeknife, not the Dublin-Monaghan bombing. The Denton report will not be published until January. \n The Taoiseach  It was a summary of Denton. \n Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett  The report states that the British Army had the names of the killers on the night of the bombing but nobody was ever arrested. The representatives of the families think that smacks of collusive behaviour. The authors were also extremely critical of the Irish authorities, including the Garda, and the British authorities for destroying much of the files and evidence so that the people compiling the report could not gather conclusive evidence. The whole thing stinks to high heaven. The representatives of the families have asked for a public inquiry. Will the Taoiseach listen to them? \n The Taoiseach  I thank all Deputies who raised issues in terms of national security and the national security strategy. It reflects a growing awareness and engagement with this House, not before time, in respect of security and defence issues. There has been a wilful ignoring of these issues for far too long in the House. Particular perspectives have been taken on this. Even this morning, there were references to the United Kingdom, Europe or America as being threats. The clear threats right now in this era include a Russian threat to our security and security infrastructure. We have had engagement between Iran and Russia and North Korea and Russia. North Korean soldiers have been on European soil during a period of war, seeking to violate the territorial integrity of Ukraine and its sovereignty. These are the realities we face. We wish we were not facing these realities and we would prefer a Continent at peace and so on.  The strategy will be completed. Deputy Brabazon was the first to speak and referred to self-reliance. We will develop radar capacity, and that is very close to action in terms of procurement – a lot of work has gone into that. We need to co-operate and co-ordinate with other member states in the European Union and the United Kingdom in respect of all of these issues because a pattern has developed in terms of the emergence of these drones and the violation of the airspace of EU member states. The most notable incident occurred in Copenhagen at the time of the European Political Community meeting. Denmark sought help and advice from other EU member states at that time. There were incidents in Belgium, France, Poland, in terms of train tracks and so on, and in the Baltic Sea. We are agreed that, on the drone issue, disabling technology is important.  The visit of President Zelenskyy was very effective from a security perspective. I want to make it clear to everybody that an incident did occur on that night. A small number of unidentified drones were observed in the vicinity of a Naval Service vessel on patrol off the coast of Dublin. The drones were not a threat to President Zelenskyy's aircraft - that needs to be clear - because it had safely landed quite some time prior to the incident, nor were they a threat to his departure. An operational response was put in place that was appropriate to the circumstances by the commander of the naval vessel at the time and, subsequently, by the police and military authorities working in close co-operation. They worked closely together in advance of the visit and so on.  The Garda liaised with its Ukrainian partners throughout the visit of the President on the security arrangements, including with regard to this incident. The Garda special detective unit is carrying out an investigation of the circumstances of the incident with input from the Defence Forces. It is a very concerning incident, as I said, like other similar incidents in other European states. The circumstances are suggestive of this being part of an ongoing Russian-inspired hybrid campaign against European Union and Ukrainian interests. \n Deputy Paul Murphy  I would like the Taoiseach to present some evidence. He said the circumstances are suggestive----- \n The Taoiseach  Of course the Deputy would. Could I say to Deputy Brabazon----- \n Deputy Paul Murphy  The circumstances are contested. It might well have been the Russians but I would like to see some evidence if this will be used as an agenda to undermine our neutrality. \n An Ceann Comhairle  We just cannot have this, Deputy Murphy. \n The Taoiseach  The gardaí----- \n An Ceann Comhairle  We cannot have this interaction. \n The Taoiseach  I will come back to the Deputy. \n Deputy Paul Murphy  I thank the Taoiseach. \n The Taoiseach  An Garda Síochána is substantively enhancing and has enhanced its anti-drone capabilities. It has significant capabilities on land, and the navy likewise. The military generally has the capabilities throughout all three strands: air, sea and land. We will continue to enhance that and harness all technology available in the country, both private sector but also on our university campuses that can assist in that regard.  All politics is local and Deputy Dolan asked about gardaí in east Galway and the expanding towns. We have seen good progress in the recruitment of gardaí through Templemore. It has seen its highest intake this year. The Commissioner has been allocating significant numbers to given areas. Dublin benefited initially. Cork is benefiting now, to be quite frank, in terms of the city centre. The idea is to get around to the rest of the country but to do it in significant numbers so it really has impact. I understand we are pleading for patience on the Deputy's behalf and others but we are making progress. Funding is there to keep the throughput at the level it currently is in Templemore.  On the remarks made by Deputy Murphy, the United Kingdom does not present a national security threat to Ireland. \n Deputy Paul Murphy  The Taoiseach should have read the Denton report. \n The Taoiseach  On the issue he raised in terms of the civil liberties issue within the UK, it is an issue the UK has to challenge and deal with. I noted his comment, \"nothing more than property damage\". That was interesting. I do not believe people should be----- \n Deputy Paul Murphy  Interned for property damage. \n The Taoiseach  No one should be interned and there should be trials. I love the Deputy's casual approach to property damage. It is fine. It is grand. Do not worry about it. Let us continue doing it. \n Deputy Paul Murphy  That is not what I said. \n The Taoiseach  It is what he implied. \n Deputy Paul Murphy  No, it is not. \n The Taoiseach  Ah, come on. \n Deputy Paul Murphy  The point I was making is it is not normal to hold people----- \n The Taoiseach  We discussed this----- \n An Ceann Comhairle  Deputy Murphy made his point already. \n Deputy Paul Murphy  -----without trial for over a year for property damage. \n An Ceann Comhairle  We are not doing this, Deputy Murphy. We are not doing this. \n Deputy Paul Murphy  That is the point I was making and the Taoiseach knows it. \n An Ceann Comhairle  There are other Members to be regarded. \n The Taoiseach  Can I just say to Deputy Murphy that Deputies in this House have had their property damaged. I do not believe that should lead to internment or anything like that. \n Deputy Paul Murphy  Exactly. \n The Taoiseach  No, no. \n An Ceann Comhairle  Allow the Taoiseach to answer. \n The Taoiseach  Let us be very clear. In dealing with protest, there are different levels of protest. The right to protest and to free speech is absolutely inviolable. It has to be allowed and facilitated in any true democracy. When protests get too extreme, you then impact on other people's rights to personal safety, life and property. I respectfully suggest that is something the Deputy does not pay much attention to. \n Deputy Paul Murphy  Israeli weaponry property? No. \n The Taoiseach  In terms of the other issue Deputy O'Meara raised, I have dealt with some of the aspects of what happened on the night and so forth. In terms of the EU Presidency, which people have raised, there is a lot of work under way to prepare for that. An Garda Síochána is central to the security planning and preparation. It has established a dedicated European Union Presidency co-ordination office, led by the deputy commissioner of policing operations to oversee all aspects of operational planning, logistics and inter-agency engagement. There is ongoing interdepartmental engagement through a whole range of forums. Close co-operation with European policing and security partners concerning the Presidency is ongoing, as per the norm.  In the modern security arena, you have to co-ordinate, co-operate and share intelligence with other agencies. That is absolutely key. Otherwise, you are at nothing in terms of protecting the State or protecting our people. I do not want to go into all of the details here. Some of this is security sensitive. I have a report about the drone situation. When we are discussing security, there has to be an understanding there are limits to what can be put into the public domain. That impacts further gathering and garnering of intelligence. It also impacts on our capacity to withstand further threats and so on like that. There will be a lot of planning for VIP protection, venue security, transport management, cyber resilience and public order contingencies. All of that is being worked on. It is a mammoth task. It is a huge operation. Other member states have had to do something similar. It is symptomatic of where we are in terms of the threats to European security and so forth.  I think I have dealt with most of the issues Deputy Rose Conway-Walsh raised and I was responding to her in respect of that. \n Deputy Rose Conway-Walsh  Sorry, the Taoiseach has not----- \n An Ceann Comhairle  Absolutely not, Deputy. The Deputy has to take the answer. \n Deputy Rose Conway-Walsh  I just want to put it on the record the Taoiseach has not answered. \n The Taoiseach  I am not finished yet. No member state yet, bar France in the past 48 hours or so, has attempted to disabled drones or bring them down, for different reasons. That is a matter we have to leave to the operational people in charge. We cannot dictate that sort of a response here. \n Deputy Rose Conway-Walsh  Do we have the capacity? \n An Ceann Comhairle  Deputy, no. \n The Taoiseach  We have the capacity. \n An Ceann Comhairle  If the Deputy needs to raise a Topical Issue, she can put one down. This is not a back and forth. \n The Taoiseach  Once again, it is a matter for those on the ground and in the theatre to decide the best and most appropriate response at the time.  I have dealt with some of Deputy Tóibín's questions. The national security council has been established. There is a clear structure emanating from that in terms of awareness, being briefed and so forth. I was briefed on this incident. I sought a briefing immediately on it and I received it. Obviously, it is something that will be discussed at the national security council later.  In terms of Deputy Lawless----- \n Deputy Peadar Tóibín  The Taoiseach has not categorically----- \n An Ceann Comhairle  No. If the Deputy is not happy with the answer, put down----- \n Deputy Peadar Tóibín  -----stated that EU leaders will be safe during the Presidency. \n An Ceann Comhairle  Deputy Tóibín, you know you are wrong. \n Deputy Peadar Tóibín  He also has not stated where those drones came from and where they went. \n An Ceann Comhairle  I am asking the Deputy to stop addressing the Taoiseach until he finishes his answers, \n Deputy Peadar Tóibín  He has not answered those questions. \n An Ceann Comhairle  The Deputy might not like the answer but it is the Taoiseach's answer. Do not interject again, please. \n The Taoiseach  I was just about to make the point in terms of the cybersecurity attacks. Sorry, we will protect those who are coming into this country. There is no question. Do not always be so fast to denigrate ourselves. Do not listen to all the noise out there. What happened during President Zelenskyy's visit was a good security operation by our Defence Forces and by an Garda----- \n Deputy Peadar Tóibín  Why will the Taoiseach not answer the question about the drones? \n An Ceann Comhairle  Deputy, please have respect for the other Members. \n The Taoiseach  Through the Chair, we need to acknowledge that and the very effective work of An Garda Síochána and our Defence Forces. There is a lot of noise which suits other interests to portray Ireland in a certain light. The Deputy should be wary of that, too.  Deputy Lawless raised the issue of cybersecurity. Cyber threats and attacks have increased significantly since the Russian invasion of Ukraine. Some have been by criminal elements, some have been by professionals. There are also third party state actors in respect of cybersecurity threats. It is a very serious issue for both public utilities and private sector companies. It is costing a lot of funding to deal with that. We have brought the National Cyber Security Centre under the Department of justice. It is a very strong centre and has grown in capacity very significantly in the past five years. I remember when we started it. It has developed a really strong capacity under Richard Browne. Credit needs to be given in respect of that.  I make the point to Deputy Ó Murchú that there is not a failure in funding, frankly, and finance will not be an issue here. What is an issue is the procurement timelines, both within the European defence industry and more generally. We are working to see if we can accelerate procurement. We are doing that with the radar. That is why we took a joint country approach to procurement - to fast track it. In other words, we use the experience and expertise of countries that have experience of procuring the radar we are now seeking. Everyone will be about how fast we can procure. It will also be about taking an intelligent approach in terms of what we procure. The nature of modern warfare or security threats has changed radically. We are all witnessing the drone technology change, as well as the cybersecurity. What can we do undersea? How do we protect cables? How do we protect gas connectors? It is a whole-of-society security approach that is required here. It is not the traditional, conventional approach to defence and security. We need to consider and explore that point more, perhaps.  On the Dublin-Monaghan bombing, Deputy Boyd-Barrett is correct insofar as the summary of the Denton report was produced yesterday. It is regrettable that we do not have the full Denton report. I think there was some legal action taken to try to prevent it being published in full. The Kenova report has been published. We should have a debate on the Kenova report in this House in the new year. It reveals very sordid activity by state actors but also by paramilitaries, including the Provisional IRA. The Kenova report does not pull its punches in saying it was a threat to its own community or attacked its own community. What went on is quite unbelievable.  The Denton report stated that 120 people were murdered by a network of loyalist paramilitaries and RUC and UDR personnel, including those killed in the Dublin-Monaghan bombings. It is a very sordid story and both the Kenova and Denton reports cover it. I pay tribute to Jon Boutcher, who is now the head of the PSNI, for his leadership on Kenova, and also to Iain Livingstone. They withstood a lot of pressure. We will have two comprehensive reports, if we can get the latter one published. \n An Ceann Comhairle  That is it, Taoiseach. We move to questions Nos. 12 to 28, inclusive. With 16 Members and a remaining 18 and a half minutes, it is highly unlikely we will get to the third group of questions. I ask Members to be brief. ",

        "answerText": " The Taoiseach  I propose to take Questions Nos. 12 to 28, inclusive, together.  The Cabinet committee on infrastructure last met on 3 November and will meet again early in the new year. The Cabinet committee works to drive infrastructure delivery and the implementation of the revised national development plan. As Members know, last week, we brought to Government the essence of that plan. The reform of the delivery of critical, growth-enhancing infrastructure is a key commitment in the programme for Government. Last week marked a major milestone on this agenda with the publication of the accelerating infrastructure report and action plan.  This plan sets out 30 high-impact and time-bound reforms to speed and scale up delivery of homes, roads, public transport, wastewater plants and energy infrastructure. Actions include legislative reforms to balance individual rights and public good, simplify regulation and consenting systems, cut administrative burden and red tape and build public acceptance and a delivery culture. The reforms align with broader housing, climate and competitiveness goals. These will be achieved by streamlining approvals to allow concurrent processing, introducing statutory timelines for major project decisions, rationalising delivery guidance to reduce duplication and complexity, enhancing procurement practices through clearer project pipelines, and fostering a delivery-focused culture that balances safeguards with urgency.  We are at a critical juncture. We have a strong economy and growing population, but our infrastructure delivery is too slow. We have a once-in-a-generation opportunity to transform this. The Government, private sector and communities must align behind delivery. The plan is underscored by the largest capital investment in the history of the State, with over €275 billion planned over the coming ten years.  Over recent weeks, Departments have published their ambitious sectoral investment plans for the next five years. Areas such as energy, transport and water will see a significant scale-up in funding and delivery, all of which will support us to address our infrastructure deficit and scale up housing. There will also be robust oversight of the Government’s performance in achieving these actions with regular reports on progress to the Cabinet committee on infrastructure. In the period ahead, the Cabinet committee will, therefore, oversee both the investments and reforms required to ensure that infrastructure is delivered as efficiently and quickly as possible. \n An Ceann Comhairle  There are 12 Deputies present. They will have 30 seconds each, which means there will be six minutes for questions and six minutes for a response. That is as fair as I can be. \n Deputy Aindrias Moynihan  The recently published national development plan update sets out an ambitious plan for key infrastructure for the years ahead. Many of the capital works are due to get under way by 2030 and others thereafter. Having a pipeline of projects ready is vital because there is so much background work involved with them. I am particularly focused on the ones after 2030. We have seen how the N22 Macroom bypass took many years to advance through the earlier stages, such as the background works, planning and design and so on. The next phase of that road is the piece between Macroom and Ballincollig. It needs to continue in the background and get through the various background stages so that we have a pipeline of projects ready to roll as soon as possible. \n Deputy Ruairí Ó Murchú  We have all seen a huge amount of flood damage and the danger of nature. While a huge amount of work has been done by local authorities and emergency services, this brings to light the need to deal expeditiously with CFRAM protections that are necessary throughout Louth. With regard to the south part of the Dundalk and Blackrock project, the promise is quarter 2 of 2027 for planning application submission. There have been promises and we have been waiting years. \n The Taoiseach  Is that CFRAM? \n Deputy Ruairí Ó Murchú  It is CFRAM. There are five particular projects throughout Louth, in Drogheda, Carlingford, Greenore, Baltray and Ardee. The lack of wastewater capacity is also causing issues. \n Deputy Albert Dolan  We need to double-track the rail line from Galway city to Athenry. The passing loop at Oranmore is under construction now. Ceannt Station is moving to be a station with five platforms. Huge investment has gone in but we must continue it because we are going to wait years for the Galway city outer bypass and the reality is that rail is the lever we can pull. We can build a double track from Athenry to Galway city which would greatly improve the quality of life for all commuters in east Galway. \n Deputy Darren O'Rourke  We need updated wind and solar farm guidelines. The wind farm guidelines are in draft form since 2019 and the last full version was in 2006. There is a commitment in the programme for Government for solar farm guidelines but recent responses say they are at a very early stage of a scoping process. When will they be ready? \n Deputy Paul Murphy  The new roll-out of BusConnects routes has been a disaster in my constituency. Constituents report that buses on the F spine route, which were supposed to provide a more direct route to the city centre and greater connectivity, are taking 20 to 30 minutes longer to get into town and providing fewer options for people trying to get to work or school. It is made worse by the frequent delays and cancellations seen across nearly all routes in Dublin South-West, including the S and W spines operated by Go-Ahead Ireland. Elsewhere, the NTA has been forced to change routes in Finglas and Chapelizod due to protests and people making their voices heard. Will the NTA do the same here or will people be forced to protest? \n Deputy Séamus McGrath  Central to a good infrastructure system is a good public transport system. I welcome the approval of BusConnects Cork by Cabinet to proceed to the planning phase. That is very welcome but we cannot wait years for improvements to the local bus service. I am sure the Taoiseach, like other public representatives in Cork, is inundated with unreliability issues relating to local bus services, such as buses not turning up, disappearing buses and inaccurate information on the travel app. It is simply not good enough and it has been going on for years. People are tired of excuses from the National Transport Authority and Bus Éireann. I ask the Taoiseach to please take this issue up and look for immediate improvements. \n Deputy Tony McCormack  While we prioritise electricity, water and transport, digital connectivity must now be treated equally. It is essential for Ireland's competitiveness. Europe has fallen behind the US and China. 5G stand-alone is under 2% in the EU and 0% in Ireland, compared with 20% in the US and 80% in China. AI, ehealth and advanced manufacturing cannot run on yesterday’s networks. If we want future investment in next-generation technology, connectivity must be prioritised. Will the Cabinet committee on infrastructure evaluate 5G stand-alone as a national priority? During Ireland's EU Presidency, will the Government push for strong, pro-investment digital policy under the digital networks Act? \n Deputy Peadar Tóibín  The Navan to Dublin rail line is not included in the national development plan review as a project that will start to be built before 2030. It has no start date for construction at all at the moment. It is up to a future government to fund the construction of a Navan to Dublin rail line. No money has been assigned or ring-fenced for that particular project, despite the fact there are 90,000 people commuting from Meath at the moment, 60,000 of whom travel by car and add to the M50 crisis. The M50 is currently grinding to a halt. If the Government wants to help fix the M50 crisis, allow people in Meath to use public transport to get to work without pushing them into cars every single day. \n Deputy Paul Lawless  Ireland faces an emergency crisis in terms of infrastructure, housing, energy and water. According to the ESRI, an additional 40,000 construction workers will be needed for the housing plan and an additional 40,000 will be needed for infrastructure. That is 80,000 construction workers who are required to meet the Government’s plan. Indeed, the Dublin metro will require 8,000 construction workers. What is the Taoiseach’s plan in order to achieve this? I speak to construction workers in Australia all the time. They want to come home but they are simply totally disenfranchised and disengaged. The Government has no interest in bringing them home. \n Deputy Rose Conway-Walsh  I know the Taoiseach will agree that the people in Mayo deserve to have proper road infrastructure. I want to specifically talk to him about the R312, which is the main road connecting Erris to the county town of Castlebar. I want it to be designated a regional strategic road because that is the only way it will get the funding it needs. It is a dangerous road. People have put up with it for years but it is time for it to be fixed. \n The Taoiseach  Which one is that? \n Deputy Rose Conway-Walsh  It is the R312. I thank the Taoiseach. \n Deputy Barry Heneghan  Ba mhaith liom ceist a chur ar an Taoiseach faoin flooding we saw in Clontarf yesterday. I thank the Minister of State, Deputy Boxer Moran, for coming down and sorting out the dreaded sandbags, but households and businesses were very worried yesterday. I had tens of people----- \n The Taoiseach  Where was that? \n Deputy Barry Heneghan  Clontarf. Does the Taoiseach not know I am a Clontarf man? The flood defence is critically needed. Will flood defences be included in critical infrastructure with the recent announcement last week? This needs to be fast-tracked and people and businesses need assurance. \n An Ceann Comhairle  Finally, Deputy Conor D. McGuinness. \n Deputy Conor D. McGuinness  Once again, I am raising with the Taoiseach the N25, which is the transport spine of Waterford's infrastructure and long regarded as the most dangerous national road in the State. There has been no funding for safety improvements. Routine maintenance, resurfacing and line painting are not good enough at this stage. Bus stops are being withdrawn. There was another HGV incident this morning just outside Dungarvan. We need to see serious investment in safety improvements on the N25 right from Rosslare to Cork city, but particularly in Waterford where there has been no funding for safety improvements. \n An Ceann Comhairle  Taoiseach, the floor is yours for five minutes. \n The Taoiseach  I love the demarcation lines. The \"Rosslare to Cork city, but particularly in Waterford\" part of it. I am sorry. I get it. Do not worry. \n Deputy Conor D. McGuinness  There have been no safety upgrades. There was a serious incident there this morning. \n The Taoiseach  It is just an observation. I will start with Deputy Aindrias Moynihan, who made a very good point. Hopefully, with this national development plan and the allocation of ten years, we will avoid this stop-start where we get a project from A to B but C is not provided for at all. We had that over the last two decades, I suppose. I recall how the Cork-Limerick road had planning in an earlier era and then that was all shelved after the financial crash and so on. If they had kept the planning going, they would have been in a much better position now to actually start. I do accept that, and particularly on the N22. The Macroom bypass has been extremely effective but there is the problem that you go along a great road into Ballincollig if you are coming from the Kerry side but then you are suddenly into what, as the Deputy was saying to me the other day, is like a parking lot for the next 20 to 40 minutes. It is a very good point that we should encourage Transport Infrastructure Ireland, TII, and others to keep thinking of the next stage and to have the planning ready and preparatory work done. I will work on that particular stretch the Deputy has referenced.  Deputy Ó Murchú raised the flood damage, CFRAM and the five projects in Louth. Deputy Barry Heneghan had a similar point. In general, flood protection schemes take a long time. Some of that is due to stakeholder engagement and public engagement, and there can be objections and so on. If any projects are of such imperative, these are. We do know that when these projects happen, they are effective in protecting against flooding. Towns that had historical flooding events have stopped them because of good infrastructure being put in. These projects invite a lot of objections. We had it in Cork city and it went the whole way to the top courts. It is only now that work is under way and all of that. There was flooding in Cork city this week. It was there because of the tidal levels, but one could argue that if you had the protections in, then businesses and people would have been protected and people could have gone in and out of town. I am very conscious of that.  With regard to Deputy Dolan's question, I will come back to the Minister. It was a good point. I do no know where we are on it in terms of the national development plan but there is no question that Galway city is facing enormous congestion, including all the areas feeding into Galway city. It is a real problem. Public transport, including rail, does give us an option, but not the whole option. We have to get the ring road done. Equally, though, the rail infrastructure is critical. I will talk to the Minister for Transport, Darragh O'Brien, about that.  Deputy O'Rourke raised the issue of the updated wind farm guidelines. The Deputy is correct that they have been a long time coming and technology has changed in the intervening period. I have asked the Minister, James Browne, to accelerate the work on the guidelines. The unit in his Department is also working on planning exemptions. There is a lot of work there. The Department is also working on rural guidelines for housing and one-off housing. There is a lot of work in that Department but I accept that we do need to bring this to a conclusion. At some stage, we need some collective debate on energy. We are all dealing with individual cases of objections to solar, objections to gas generation, objections to wind onshore, and objections to wind offshore potentially. We desperately need the offshore wind. This is something we have got to progress through planning. I am hoping we can get wind farms built, certainly through 2030 to 2031. If we do not, then we are in trouble from an energy perspective. As a collective - when I say \"collective\", I mean the entire Oireachtas - we have to try to stand back and say that there are huge challenges. We discussed security earlier. We are very dependent on the importation of fossil fuels through the interconnectors. There are real issues here that we need to be clear-eyed about. We can then take decisions once everybody realises that there are pluses and minuses in all of this.  Deputy Paul Murphy raised BusConnects, which he said was a \"disaster\"----- \n Deputy Paul Murphy  Some of it. \n The Taoiseach  That is okay. It is a word that is not uncommon. Anyway, I have had my issues with BusConnects down through the years. There have been issues for habitual users of bus services who feel the changing of services or the reorientation of scheduling and so on has eroded what they would have had prior to it. Then we had all the issues around what were, in my view, over-the-top initial plans, which then got rolled back. This seems to have been a pattern throughout the BusConnects journey and I think lessons could be learned from that. A lot of heat built up that perhaps was not necessary in the first place because a lot of stuff that was proposed was then taken away. We will engage with the National Transport Authority, NTA, in terms of what is happening. It has made a lot of progress now on BusConnects. We need a good bus transport system.  That brings me to Deputy Séamus McGrath's point. Yes, I have heard similar reports in terms of reliability. Originally, a year and a half ago, the shortage of drivers was blamed, but we definitely need to improve reliability. There had been very good stuff happening in public transport growth and so on.  I will talk to Deputy McCormack again. The Deputy is absolutely correct that America, China and others are way ahead of us in some of this in the digital space. We need to catch up fairly quickly. I will look at the 5G stand-alone issue.  Deputy Tóibín mentioned the NDP. The Navan rail line is in the NDP review----- \n Deputy Peadar Tóibín  It is not a Bill. \n The Taoiseach  The Deputy has a great capacity. He is brilliant at it, actually. From a political agitation perspective, the Deputy has a great capacity to turn what others would see as success into defeat. For the Deputy in opposition to say that we are not releasing----- \n Deputy Peadar Tóibín  That----- \n An Ceann Comhairle  Do not interrupt. \n Deputy Peadar Tóibín  I have to, a Cheann Comhairle. \n An Ceann Comhairle  No, Deputy Tóibín, do not even dare. \n The Taoiseach  The Deputy is trying to ask how I can----- \n An Ceann Comhairle  Deputy Tóibín will have to look for it afterwards. \n The Taoiseach  I spoke to the Minister, Deputy O'Brien, about this and he is very clear that the Navan line is going ahead. \n Deputy Peadar Tóibín  There is no date for construction. \n An Ceann Comhairle  Do not even think about it. \n The Taoiseach  The Government is absolutely committed to it.  On Deputy Lawless's question, there is a huge increase in apprenticeships. We are recruiting people back. We are anxious for people to come back into the country, and people are coming back into the country. The construction industry is confident enough in terms of the numbers for getting the housing done, for example, and the huge retrofit programme that is going on as well.  I will talk and engage with the Minister in respect of Deputy Conway-Walsh's query on the R312.  Regarding Deputy Heneghan's question, I have discussed that in terms of Clontarf and flood relief generally. It will be part of critical infrastructure, absolutely. I see it as critical infrastructure because it is a big threat to us. The storms are worse and they are more severe. We need to accelerate the protection of people, households and businesses in that respect.  On the N25, we need to get the bypasses along that road. That is a section of the road that definitely needs improvement.  I thank the Ceann Comhairle. \n An Ceann Comhairle  I thank the Taoiseach and Members. For future reference, if there needs to be back and forth, this is not the forum in which to pose a question. \n Deputy Ruairí Ó Murchú  In the review----- \n An Ceann Comhairle  We have a Dáil reform committee today at which it will be discussed. \n The Taoiseach  We need a bit of entertainment and lively engagement, too. \n An Ceann Comhairle  This is not the forum, Taoiseach.

        "answerText": " Minister for Health  Supported by 158 million euros of funding, in the last four years, the State has delivered access to 243 new medicines. One hundred and one (101) of these were for cancer and 67 of these were for rare diseases. Budget 2026 allocated €30 million for new drugs from €217 million in additional funding for medicines.  It should be noted that once new medicines are approved the full cost of providing them as their uptake increases can reach multiples of this initial cost.  Under the Health (Pricing and Supply of Medical Goods) Act 2013, the HSE has statutory responsibility for decisions on pricing and reimbursement of medicines under the community drugs schemes.  The HSE has advised that it is committed to providing access to as many medicines as possible, in as timely a fashion as possible, from the resources available (provided) to it.  The HSE must robustly assess applications for pricing and reimbursement to make sure that it can stretch available resources as far as possible and to deliver the best value in relation to each medicine and ultimately more medicines to Irish citizens and patients.  HSE decisions on which medicines are reimbursed by the taxpayer are made on objective, scientific and economic grounds.  There are formal processes which govern applications for the pricing and reimbursement of medicines, and new uses of existing medicines, to be funded and / or reimbursed.  The HSE must robustly assess each application for pricing/reimbursement on objective, scientific, and economic grounds, and on the advice of the National Centre for Pharmacoeconomics to ensure that medicines can be made available to patients in Ireland who need them.  Liraglutide (Saxenda®) 6 mg/ml solution for injection in pre-filled pen is the only product currently approved under Community Drug Schemes (GMS/Drugs Payment Scheme (DPS)) for weight management with a managed access system in place.  The HSE introduced a managed access protocol (MAP) for liraglutide (Saxenda®) in January 2023. The aim of the MAP is to provide patients with an initial body mass index (BMI) greater than or equal to 35 kg/m2, with prediabetes and high-risk for cardiovascular disease, with access to reimbursement support for liraglutide (Saxenda®) for weight management. Liraglutide (Saxenda®) is a glucagon-like peptide-1 analogue and is indicated as an adjunct to a reduced-calorie diet and increased physical activity for weight management in adult patients.  Mounjaro® (tirzepatide) and Wegovy® (semaglutide) are not reimbursable under Community Drug Schemes or any arrangement as they are undergoing formal pricing and reimbursement assessments. ",

        "answerText": " The Taoiseach  I propose to take Questions Nos. 1 to 12 together.  The UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer and I both attended the recent G20 Summit in South Africa. We had a number of conversations in the margins of meetings there, including on the situation in Ukraine, on which an informal meeting of the coalition of the willing took place. Previously, I met with Prime Minister Starmer at Chequers on 12 September. We discussed a broad range of matters, including the positive state of bilateral relations between Ireland and the UK. We also discussed the legacy framework - this was one of the reasons I went to Chequers - which was published subsequently on 19 September. The Prime Minister and I took note of progress on the UK-Ireland 2030 programme of strategic co-operation since the summit on 6 March on implementation across each of the programme’s four pillars of security, justice and global issues; climate, energy and innovation; growth, trade and investment; and culture, education and people-to-people links. We looked ahead to the second UK-Ireland summit, which Ireland will host in the spring of 2026. This work complements that undertaken under the British-Irish Council, which will meet in Wales later this week, and the British-Irish Intergovernmental Conference, which took place in Dublin on 17 November.  The Prime Minister and I also discussed a range of international issues, including the catastrophic situation in Gaza. We agreed in particular on the then urgent need for a ceasefire, the release of hostages and the delivery of humanitarian aid at scale, as well as finding a pathway to a two-state solution for a lasting peace. We committed to continue to work together with the coalition of the willing to strengthen support for Ukraine and increase pressure on Russia to stop its war of aggression on the people of Ukraine.  Deputies may wish to be aware that the First Minister of Scotland, John Swinney, was in Ireland last week to mark the agreement of a new bilateral co-operation framework between Ireland and Scotland. The new framework includes six broad areas for future co-operation, including in the context of a strengthened Ireland-UK relationship. I also met with First Minister Swinney in Government Buildings during his visit. \n Deputy Brendan Smith  I have had numerous opportunities in this House to welcome in general terms the legacy framework that was agreed between the British and Irish Governments and published in early September. There is an urgent need to enact legislation to give effect to the provisions outlined in the framework. Did the Taoiseach detect an urgency or a very strong commitment from the UK Prime Minister on the need to get this issue dealt with? Many families have waited for justice for decades and decades. We have to move on and get progress on the rights, the concerns and the grief that engulfs so many families of victims for many decades now. At the end of this month, we will mark the 53rd anniversary of the Belturbet bombing, which cost the lives of two young teenagers. We also have had significant dates in relation to commemorations, for example marking the terrible atrocities in Monaghan and Dublin in May 1974. There are so many atrocities for which nobody has been brought to justice. We cannot ever attach enough urgency to trying to deal, once and for all, with legacy issues. \n Deputy Ruth Coppinger  The right to protest against the genocide in Palestine is being severely undermined the UK and this is being carried through to the North as well. I want to raise a case with the Taoiseach that he could raise with the Prime Minister. This is the case of Saoirse Wagner, a student at Queen's University in Belfast, who is being threatened with expulsion for taking part in a peaceful, calm and non-threatening protest on the issue of Palestine. The Palestine assembly in the college protested at the careers fair to highlight companies that are participating in the genocide. I think the Taoiseach will agree with me that taking part in student protest is a fundamental right and so important in our democracy. To threaten a student with their whole third level education being completely taken away for participating in a peaceful protest is something we should take a stand against. I ask the Taoiseach to make representations to the college. Saoirse is known to me. I know that she would not participate in anything violent. I ask the Taoiseach to take this case on board. \n Deputy Ruairí Ó Murchú  We are coming up to the 50th anniversary of the Dundalk bombing, which happened on 19 December 1975. Dundalk lost Hugh Watters, who was a local tailor and a well-respected man, and Jack Rooney, a fireman and a man who worked for the council. Obviously, this was devastating for their families. A memorial event has been organised by the families. It is going to happen near the courthouse, where there is a plaque, at 6.15 p.m. on Friday, 19 December. I think it is very important that we commemorate this 50th anniversary. It was the same night as the attack on Donnelly's Bar in Silverbridge where three people were killed. This was carried out by the Glenanne gang. We know this was a UVF gang which had members of the UDR and the RUC within it and obviously, the British state was up to its neck in relation to it. I would ask about the engagement around producing a framework that will actually deliver for families like these that have been failed and that Britain does not walk away from its role and its dirty war that it fought in Ireland. \n Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett  The Taoiseach said he discussed Gaza and Palestine with Keir Starmer. A standard tactic of the Israeli state has been to say that anybody who criticises Israel for genocide, apartheid, ethnic cleansing or the persecution of Palestinians, is somehow antisemitic. Keir Starmer, of course, has a record of going along with that nonsense and attacking people like Jeremy Corbyn, who is one of the most long-standing anti-racists and an absolute opponent of antisemitism. It is an outrageous accusation. We have now seen an instance of our own ambassador being dressed down by an Israeli minister, who accused the Irish people and the Irish Government of antisemitism. I would like to know what the Taoiseach thinks about that. Is he capitulating to that bullying by the Israeli state by intervening on the proposal to rename Herzog Park? This is an entirely justified proposal, given Chaim Herzog's history of involvement in ethnic cleansing of Palestinians. \n Deputy Peadar Tóibín  A series health crisis is arising in the North of Ireland at the moment. Sinn Féin, the DUP, the UUP and the Alliance Party are closing down key hospital services in Daisy Hill Hospital, Enniskillen and Causeway Hospital in Derry. These closures are having a significant effect on services. Patients in Craigavon hospital are waiting for 19 hours to see their emergency doctor. The waiting time at the emergency department in the Royal Victoria Hospital is nine hours.  One day, there were 40 ambulances stuck at hospitals trying to deliver their patients. The longest waiting time was 13 hours. I pay tribute to the SOS Causeway Hospital campaign and Gemma Brolly, who is involved in that.  The boss of the British Medical Association in the North stated that an all-Ireland GP service would be a way to help resolve these crises. Daisy Hill, Enniskillen and Causeway all have hinterlands that feed into the South of Ireland in areas where there is great need for hospital services too. Is the Taoiseach speaking to the British Prime Minister about developing an all-Ireland health service? \n Deputy Liam Quaide  When I asked the Taoiseach about flood relief for east Cork villages last week, he accused me of being sly in how I had raised the question. That adjective could be more fairly levelled at his British counterpart, Keir Starmer, who built his political career on the basis of being a human rights lawyer and unifier of the left. In power, he has enthusiastically supported the imprisonment of people for years who protest against climate inaction, along with the designation of protesters of genocide as terrorists. I fully appreciate that the UK makes its own political decisions and that we have to maintain good relations with political leaders with whom we often might have major disagreements, but it is also true that Irish citizens are affected by Starmer’s authoritarian crackdown on peaceful protests. Acclaimed novelist Sally Rooney has been prevented from collecting a prestigious Sky Arts award in person due to fears of arrest for her support of Palestine Action. Great-grandmother Máire Ní Mhurchú, originally from Douglas in Cork, was arrested in London in September, along with her sisters Gráinne and Olga, for a peaceful protest against genocide. When the Taoiseach met Keir Starmer, did he raise with him his government's aggressive and authoritarian approach to peaceful protest and its impact on Irish as well as British citizens? \n Deputy Shane Moynihan  With reference to the Taoiseach’s meeting with British Prime Minister, Keir Starmer, I note the progress made by the UK Government with regard to dealing with legacy, and I compliment Deputy Smith on his work in this area in particular.  I note the publication this week by the House of Commons Northern Ireland Affairs Committee around legacy. One of the more interesting recommendations was that Ireland needs to do more with regard to legacy. I would love to hear the Taoiseach's thoughts on that given that all of the legacy investigations of this country have been ECHR compliant, which is not necessarily something that can be said in the case of the UK.  I call for increased and accelerated action on, in particular, the Dublin and Monaghan bombings. That has been raised many times in this House and it needs to fall under the ambit of the legacy issues as well.  What engagement has the Taoiseach had with the Prime Minister on the ongoing humanitarian disaster of a crisis in Sudan, somewhere the international community needs to step up and pay attention? I wish to hear his thoughts on their engagement on that matter. \n Deputy Rose Conway-Walsh  There can be no watering-down of the commitments made in the British and Irish Governments' joined legacy framework. There are parts of that framework I question but it is very important. I welcome the Northern Ireland Affairs Committee report on this legacy legislation. The primary legislation underpinning the political framework is moving through Westminster. The bottom line is that the legislation must command the confidence of the families and be human rights compliant in order for it to properly deal with the legacy of the past. Reports that the legislation, which is already weak in parts, could be watered down are extremely concerning and will not be accepted. It is deeply concerning that any legislation would provide the British Secretary of State with the power to veto disclosure on national security grounds for family reports from the information retrieval body, the ICIR and the new legacy commission. All families and survivors have the right to have an Article 2-compliant investigation into the deaths of their loved ones. \n Deputy Paul Murphy  A new defence co-operation agreement with Britain is to be signed soon. Members of the House of Lords are saying it will mean a stronger defence relationship between Ireland and the UK. The Taoiseach himself has said there must be very close co-operation with the British when it comes to security. Does he really think that is what Irish people want? Has he forgotten that our neutrality originates from an anti-imperialist struggle against Britain, a struggle Fianna Fáll once fought for? Can he tell us what will be in this new military agreement? Britain is increasing its military expenditure by £67.7 billion. It is an active participant in the genocide in Gaza. Are we going to be expected to massively increase our military expenditure, too, as part of this new agreement? \n The Taoiseach  I thank all of the Deputies for raising a range of issues. Deputy Smith was the first to raise the issue of legacy. I believe there is a sincere commitment on behalf of the British Government as to the implementation of the legacy framework. That is shared by Prime Minister Starmer and, indeed, Secretary of State Hilary Benn, who has acted honourably in all of the negotiations and discussions in respect of the legacy framework. I visited Chequers last September specifically on legacy, along with other issues. It was important to meet with Keir Starmer on that. He has experience of the North from a former role there.  I know the Deputy has been a strong advocate on Belturbet and Monaghan and Dublin. From our perspective, it is important that the Denton report may shed some light on the Monaghan bombing and related issues Deputy Ó Murchú raised. This is relevant also to the activities of the Glennane gang and we eagerly await its publication. Operation Kenova was quite good, in my view, particularly in terms of the victims, who were very impressed with Jon Boutcher when he was in charge of Kenova. They articulated to me that he was one of the first people they met who understood where the families of the victims are coming from.  Deputy Moynihan also raised legacy. We have responsibilities in our jurisdiction. If assertions are made about us, we need to robustly deal with them, but the most effective way to do it is to make sure we respond properly to legacy. As part of the framework agreement, the British Government has, with speed, produced its legislation. That demonstrates the seriousness with which it is approaching this essential work. We are also producing legislation once the UK legislation is enacted. The Minister, Deputy O'Callaghan, has said he is hopeful the general scheme of the Bill will be published in April or May of next year. Enabling reciprocal co-operation between the two jurisdictions is at the heart of the agreed joint framework on legacy.  Additionally, as part of the joint framework agreement, the Garda Commissioner has agreed to the establishment by the end of this year of a dedicated unit as a central point of contact in relation to Troubles-related investigations undertaken by An Garda Síochána. That is an important step forward. Unionist communities in the North have always had a view. We did the Smithwick tribunal and we dealt with it quickly as part of the commitment of earlier agreements, but we do also have to be upfront in terms of the legacy framework and respond properly and comprehensively in relation to that.  I say to Deputy Ó Murchú and all those concerned about legacy that it is not about British state violence alone. It is about that, but it is also about the role of the paramilitaries, such as the Provisional IRA. I have met families of victims who have had no closure at all in terms of atrocities committed by the Provisional IRA or the Ulster loyalist groups. The focus has to be broad-based. There is an opportunity in this legacy framework to give closure to families once and for all, after decades of a lack of closure.  Deputy Coppinger raised the issue of Saoirse Wagner and asked me to talk to the Queen's University authorities. The right to protest is sacrosanct. A number of Deputies have raised this issue. Sometimes protests impede other people from doing their normal work, which is a problem. People are entitled to protest. When the war in Gaza started, I was addressing a group of 100 law students, but the objective of a protest was to stop me and to interfere with the exercise and engagement with about 100 law students. People were shouting internally, security asked them to leave and eventually they did. I was in no doubt that the whole purpose was that I would not have that engagement. Where is the balance of rights there in terms of my freedom to speak as a public representative or the freedom of people in the community to hear me? A lot of protests have crossed the line, in my opinion, with a view to stopping things happening. During a consultative forum on security challenges that I hosted as Minister for foreign affairs two years ago, the protests at that were not about protests. They were deliberately calculated to disrupt the event. \n Deputy Paul Murphy  The forum was not about consultation either, was it? \n The Taoiseach  It was a legitimate consultation. If the Deputy believes in freedom of assembly and freedom of speech, what he and like-minded people were about was stopping that from even happening.  They never complain about that. It is fair play for them to do that. There is balance here. \n Deputy Ruth Coppinger  I do not know about the protest. \n The Taoiseach  Of course the Deputy knows about the protests. She knows all about them. \n Deputy Ruth Coppinger  I have no idea what the Taoiseach is on about. \n The Taoiseach  They were on the public television, for God's sake. \n Deputy Ruth Coppinger  I do not organise every protest in Ireland. \n The Taoiseach  They were on the public television, in the media and everywhere. In this House----- \n Deputy Paul Murphy  That does not make it terrorism. \n The Taoiseach  -----assertions were made. I am not calling it that. \n An Ceann Comhairle  The Deputies are only delaying the next question. \n The Taoiseach  The point I am illustrating is that there are different forms of protest on the continuum and some of those forms are unacceptable----- \n Deputy Ruth Coppinger  We did not organise----- \n An Ceann Comhairle  Deputy, stop engaging, please. \n The Taoiseach  -----as an infringement of the rights of people generally. That is the point I am making. \n An Ceann Comhairle  The time has elapsed. \n Deputy Ruth Coppinger  I am just correcting a mistruth there. \n The Taoiseach  It is not a one-way street----- \n An Ceann Comhairle  It does not matter. \n The Taoiseach  -----all of the time. That is the point I am making. Ramming gates at Shannon Airport is not a legitimate form of protest. Stopping trade through Dublin Port is not a legitimate form of protest----- \n Deputy Ruth Coppinger  We are not. \n The Taoiseach  -----because people's livelihood depends on it. Eighty per cent of trade in this country goes through Dublin Port. Having a problem with a company is not a justification, in my view, for disrupting the entire port. I have no problem having a debate. I participated in protests as a student. I think student protests are important. \n Deputy Ruth Coppinger  Did you? \n An Ceann Comhairle  This is not a debate. \n The Taoiseach  I did, actually \n Deputy Ruth Coppinger  Okay, I will look that one up. \n The Taoiseach  The Deputy can do that. Joe Duffy was put in prison as a result of that protest. It was to do with medical cards. There you are now. Students in this country automatically had medical cards at one time. That was taken away in the eighties. The point is that legitimate protests----- \n Deputy Ruth Coppinger  Which party was that? \n An Ceann Comhairle  Ah please, Deputy, we have to get through this. \n The Taoiseach  I think it was the Deputy's former colleagues in the Labour Party. \n An Ceann Comhairle  Taoiseach, are we moving on? \n The Taoiseach  That is history. Protests happen, and I have no issue with that, but there is a continuum. I will take the Ceann Comhairle's advice.  To Deputy Ó Murchú, I have dealt with some of the legacy issues, which Deputy Conway-Walsh also raised. I will talk to Queen's University on that point. In terms of the Dundalk bombing and the Glennane gang, I hope Operation Denton will shed light on that. \n Deputy Peadar Tóibín  What about the health services? \n The Taoiseach  I will come to that. On Deputy Boyd Barrett's question, there is no relationship between the strategy and policy of the Israeli Government and my views on the renaming of Herzog Park. I have a very basic view. Throughout the history of the State, there have been namings and renamings. I am, and have been, a student of history and I taught students. I always showed them that the names of parks could be the remnants of empire or anything, but they are windows to explain the history of a given subject or personality. If we keep shutting down everything that is named after somebody, there will be no history left. \n Deputy Paul Murphy  When was it named Herzog Park? \n The Taoiseach  There will not be a history left. \n Deputy Paul Murphy  When was it named Herzog Park? It was ten or 20 years ago. \n An Ceann Comhairle  Please move on, Taoiseach. \n The Taoiseach  That is not the point. \n Deputy Paul Murphy  That is not history. \n The Taoiseach  It is, actually, if you go back through his father and before that and examine how Jewish communities came to Ireland in the first instance. There is huge history there, for God's sake. \n Deputy Paul Murphy  But not the park. \n An Ceann Comhairle  Deputy----- \n Deputy Paul Murphy  It is still history if you change the name of the park. \n The Taoiseach  As a historian and someone who is interested in history, I would be very careful. \n An Ceann Comhairle  -----you are verging on disruptive. \n The Taoiseach  Breandán Ó hEithir wrote in Lig Sinn i gCathú about the thirties when places were being shut down left, right and centre. \n An Ceann Comhairle  Seven more Deputies, Taoiseach. \n The Taoiseach  There is a lot more to it than that, but it has nothing to do with this. I can put Deputy Boyd Barrett at ease in that regard. \n An Ceann Comhairle  There are seven more Deputies to answer, Taoiseach. \n The Taoiseach  By the way, I object, like the Deputy does, to Israel's consistent messaging that if you are not onside, you are offside or antisemitic. That is wrong. You are entitled to be against Israeli Government policy and criticise it and not be labelled antisemitic. That is absolutely correct and I support it.  Deputy Tóibín should talk to his former colleagues in Sinn Féin in earnest and engage with them on the health services in Northern Ireland. That is one issue. There are broader problems with the National Health Service generally, but there are real issues in Northern Ireland. There is no question about the pressures on the health service there. \n Deputy Peadar Tóibín  There are benefits to an all-Ireland health service. \n An Ceann Comhairle  Deputy, this is not a continuous back-and-forth. I am not allowing that. This is Taoiseach's Questions. The Deputy has asked a question and is getting an answer. \n The Taoiseach  Under the shared island initiative, we are trying to do specific projects and programmes, for example in paediatric and cardiovascular health, cardiac surgery and the cancer centre at Altnagelvin hospital. Those are good programmes that have worked very well.  Deputy Quaide referred to Prime Minister Starmer. I do not see him as an authoritarian person when I meet him. I spoke about the continuum of protest. I am not au fait with British security services or why they came to do what they did in respect of Palestine Action. We have proceeded differently in this country. When I meet Prime Minister Starmer, I will have an opportunity to deal fundamentally with a range of issues although we cannot deal with every single issue. The UK has had challenges on both sides of the political spectrum in respect of protests and the nature of those protests.  I dealt with the points raised by Deputy Shane Moynihan about Operation Denton. The Sudan issue is one I have raised consistently with leaders, including publicly, at the G20 summit and at the Africa-European Union summit. It is catastrophic. It rarely gets mentioned in this House, but 12 million people have been displaced. Genocide against the civilian population is happening there. Some of the rebel forces are being supported by neighbouring countries with arms and so forth.  To respond to Deputy Conway-Walsh, the framework is Article 2 compliant. It is far stronger than its predecessor as a legacy Bill.  Deputy Murphy raised the new co-operation agreement. It absolutely makes sense that we co-operate very closely with the United Kingdom on the gas connectors, for example. Those are a huge security vulnerability for both the UK and Ireland, but particularly for Ireland. Within a week, our economy would come to a standstill if anything untoward were to happen to those interconnectors. I hope the Deputy would agree that we should have close defence co-operation for our economic security, in particular, and for our subsea cables. That will mean a lot of technological co-operation. When a Russian shadow fleet crosses over those pipes or subsea cables, very often divers have to go down and check that the pipes are okay. That is co-operation. Letting people know that somebody who might be up to not good is in your terrain is co-operation. Intelligence services sharing information about terrorists or potential attacks is co-operation. There should be no big deal about co-operation.  By the way, on the origin of our neutrality, it was not an anti-imperialist origin. In fact, at the consultative forum, there was a very good seminar on our neutrality and its origins. Obviously, the Second World War was at the core. We were neutral in not having issues with Britain and the occupation of Northern Ireland and so on, but the more fundamental issue was that it was a neutrality of survival. No one was in a position to defend Ireland in 1939, 1940 or 1941. There were good presentations made at that consultative forum but Deputy Murphy boycotted it because he felt it was not worthwhile. It would have been informative had he gone. It would have provided a more nuanced view----- \n Deputy Paul Murphy  It is a shame the Taoiseach scrapped the idea of a citizens' assembly. \n The Taoiseach  -----of the origins of our neutrality. \n An Ceann Comhairle  I thank the Taoiseach and ask him to move to the next question. \n The Taoiseach  I apologise. I thank the Ceann Comhairle for her tolerance. \n An Ceann Comhairle  It is not my tolerance. I get complaints at the Business Committee that this forum is not working. We are going to take it to the Dáil reform committee for change. ",

        "answerText": " The Taoiseach  I propose to take Questions Nos. 13 to 23, inclusive, together.  Regulation, and the extent of any regulatory or administrative burden, has recently become a greater focus at European Union level and nationally as a means to further enhance competitiveness. At a European level, both simplification and implementation are important Commission priorities. The Commission is striving to simplify and lighten the administrative burden of European Union regulations to ensure they are proportionate, stable, coherent and technologically neutral.  Likewise, our national regulatory framework is a central focus for the Government as we strive to support competitiveness at a time of international economic uncertainty. In line with the programme for Government, we published an action plan on competitiveness and productivity on 10 September this year. The action plan includes actions across government to ensure the development of a more effective regulatory system which will support economic growth.  These actions reflect priority areas where targeted public policy intervention can have the greatest impact. These include a red-tape challenge to reduce regulation for SMEs; the application of the SME test by Government Departments to all measures, in particular policy initiatives where it is proposed to increase costs on small businesses; expediting the Environmental (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill; commencing reforms, as we have done, under the Planning and Development Act 2024 to enhance delivery of infrastructure; and implementing the outstanding recommendations from the review of the administration of civil justice review group report.  Increased regulatory burden has also been identified as a barrier to infrastructure development and delivery. The Minister, Deputy Chambers, supported by the work of the accelerating infrastructure task force, this morning, with Government colleagues including me, the Tánaiste and the Minister of State, Deputy Harkin, published a plan which will include extensive regulatory reforms aimed at accelerating the delivery of critical infrastructure.  Today's plan provides the blueprint to reduce complexity and blockages in the system and deliver infrastructure with urgency. The changes we are initiating today are vital if we are to maintain our competitive position in an ever uncertain world. They are also necessary to support our citizens with top class public services, job security, access to housing and all other facilities necessary to enjoy the stability and good quality of life we are all entitled to expect.  The actions are ambitious but achievable, and delivering them will require commitment and co-operation across a broad and diverse range of stakeholders, from political, legal and public sectors, industry and society as a whole. We have established a cost-of-business advisory forum where business owners and representative bodies can speak directly to decision-makers about the real-world impact of regulations, fees and operational challenges. The work of that forum is under way. The Minister, Deputy McEntee, is working on the simplification omnibus packages put forward by the European Commission in a range of policy areas, most recently the Commission's digital simplification omnibus package, which was published last month.  My Department will play a co-ordinating role across these different regulatory reform initiatives, as outlined in the action plan on competitiveness and productivity, including the establishment of a central economic regulators' forum, and we will work with the Minister for Enterprise, Tourism and Employment and other Government colleagues on that agenda. \n Deputy Tony McCormack  I thank the Taoiseach for his response. I acknowledge the significant work he, the Minister, Deputy Chambers, and their two Departments are doing on infrastructure reform, particularly the steps being taken to modernise planning, reduce delays and ensure major projects move forward. Infrastructure reform is vital, but businesses and especially SMEs are also calling for a more streamlined regulatory environment. These firms consistently cite overlapping rules, slow approvals and heavy administrative demands as major obstacles to growth. Building on the work already happening on infrastructure, will the Taoiseach update the House on what specific measures his Department is pursuing to simplify compliance for SMEs, reduce unnecessary paperwork and make it easier for businesses to operate and expand? How will these reforms help to lower costs for employers and the taxpayer by making the system more efficient overall? \n Deputy Albert Dolan  It is vital that when we speak about regulatory reform, we talk about the administrative operations of existing systems in the function of the State. I will specifically reflect on the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland, SEAI, and the roll-out of grants. We are about to have a debate in this Chamber on energy costs. One thing that is vital is that the best way the Government can help to reduce energy costs in homes is to retrofit them for the future so that they simply do not need as much energy. That is the number one way to reduce the cost and it facilitates homes to be more efficient and takes pressure off the grid. The Government needs to do something to accelerate the rate at which homes can be retrofitted by the SEAI. For many constituents in my constituency, it is taking too long to get through the process of approval of the grant to construction. \n Deputy Ruairí Ó Murchú  We all accept there are huge issues with bureaucracy and red tape in planning. We should have seen simplification and streamlining. Conversations about this are occurring across Europe, but we know about the home-grown issues. It is an issue I have brought up previously, even within the planning systems involving State authorities. For example, Louth County Council is involved in the Ardee Education Together National School build and a particular issue has arisen. We do not have enough agility in the system. Multiple requests have gone in stating that there are not enough parking spaces. There are 21 spaces, including three disability spaces. There are only two set-down spaces for minibuses and there is a need for five as there are five autism spectrum disorder, ASD, classes and there is not even room for a full-size 52-seater bus to turn. There are 21 spaces for staff and there is a need for something closer to 40. \n An Ceann Comhairle  Thank you, Deputy. \n Deputy Ruairí Ó Murchú  It is possible to get this work done at this time, but if the works continue as planned, the problem will still need to be fixed but it could take more than €100,000, so we need something to be done. \n Deputy Darren O'Rourke  I raise the regulation of social media companies in the online space, particularly as it relates to children. The criticism that has been levelled at Coimisiún na Meán's online safety code is that an earlier draft had a recommendation that social media companies turn off recommender systems and it has been removed. Recommender systems profile people who are using apps and then drive them down often hateful and dangerous rabbit holes. It is not healthy for them or society. Will this be looked at? \n Deputy Ruth Coppinger  I raise regulatory reform of immigration and particularly family reunification. It is now being made much harder for many essential workers to be unified with their families, in particular migrant healthcare assistants who were brought over here on a visa programme and are working in private nursing homes. Last week on RTÉ radio, the Minister for justice was asked by the presenter whether these people are not entitled to a normal family life. They are caring for our older people and we have to show we care for them. The Minister's reply was that no one is forcing them to come here. That is absolutely heartless, shows zero empathy and is also completely counterproductive because many of them are nurses. They could go to other countries, but they have come to Ireland and are working below their grades or qualifications, giving huge added value to the nursing homes. I urge the Taoiseach to have a heart. We had a briefing here a few years ago, which Deputy Michael Healy-Rae attended because he knew the value of those healthcare assistants in nursing homes. These are essential workers and they will go elsewhere. \n An Ceann Comhairle  Thank you, Deputy. \n Deputy Ruth Coppinger  Please entitle them to have a normal family life. These mothers should not be separated from their kids. \n Deputy Paul Murphy  The programme for Government says the Government will move responsibility for the Multi-Unit Developments, MUD, Acts to the Department of housing from the Department of justice and establish a unit in the Housing Agency to regulate owners' management companies, OMCs, to ensure effective governance. That is important work that needs to happen. The problem is that it is not happening currently, but it has been agreed. Effectively what is holding it up is that, as a result of the Mulcreevy judgment, the primary legislation needs to be changed. At the moment, the MUD Act refers to the Minister for justice and not the Minister for housing. A simple amendment is needed to change the reference to the Minister for housing. Until that happens, all this work of regulatory oversight of OMCs and so on is simply not taking place. There was a meeting of the housing committee to discuss these issues. It invited various officials from the Department of housing and was told they could not come yet because their line Minister is not yet responsible for this. \n An Ceann Comhairle  Thank you, Deputy. \n Deputy Paul Murphy  The Housing Agency has not been allocated funding for doing any regulatory work as a result. This needs urgent action. \n Deputy Liam Quaide  There was a health committee session last week on the regulation of counselling and psychotherapy. In standards it has published, CORU has adopted a position that is entirely at odds with the main representative groups of those disciplines, which will reduce supervision requirements and remove mandatory personal therapy for trainees. These changes, if implemented, will degrade professional standards and undermine patient safety. CORU is showing a remarkable level of intransigence on these fundamentals of safe practice. Practitioners and representative bodies have warned that the proposals could also jeopardise recognition and mobility across the EU for counsellors and psychotherapists. We must protect high-quality training, preserve public confidence and ensure regulation strengthens, not weakens, these services.  I am not expressing some fringe opinion. The health committee was unanimous in supporting the counselling and psychotherapy representative groups and the session included some strong and insightful contributions from the Taoiseach's party colleagues, including Senator Costello. Will the Government immediately pause the CORU process, bring representative bodies and practitioners into full consultation and commit to reforms that prioritise client safety and high professional standards? \n Deputy Rose Conway-Walsh  I will talk about the regulation of quarries. The Taoiseach knows the price we have paid in this country and the price that families affected by the defective concrete blocks scandal have paid due to a lack of regulation.  Many of the homeowners I have spoken to in Mayo are not satisfied with the current regulations of quarries and in particular, that geologists are not examining the aggregate within the quarries that are being used to build homes now. I ask the Taoiseach to have a look at this area to see what can be done in that regard. It can be easily fixed by engaging and employing geologists to do the job and to make sure that people have confidence in the materials that are coming out of quarries. \n Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett  The Taxi Regulation Act 2013 clearly gives the Minister the power to impose regulations around the activities of dispatch companies. Today, for the third time in two weeks, taxi drivers in Dublin are protesting. There is a widespread protest against this across the country by taxi drivers over the behaviour of Uber, a multimillion euro company, that is trying to undermine the livelihood of nearly 20,000 taxi drivers by introducing a fixed fare system. This will undermine the regulated fare structure and therefore the livelihoods of taxi drivers and ultimately the industry itself. In the long run, as is clear from Uber's behaviour elsewhere in the world, it will not benefit the customer. Once the company gets hold of a market, fares and charges go up and the livelihoods of taxi drivers get smashed. Will the Taoiseach ask the Minister for Transport to impose such regulations to prevent Uber destroying the industry and livelihoods of taxi drivers around this fixed fare system and enforce the taxi regulation and meter stuff? \n The Taoiseach  Deputy McCormack raised infrastructure reform, particularly for small to medium-sized businesses. Some of the measures we have taken in respect of deferring the alignment of the minimum wage with the national living wage will help to avoid the escalation of costs because the SME sector has borne the brunt of a lot of additional costs over the past five years. There is no doubt the reduction in VAT on hospitality will help a lot of SMEs in the hospitality sector and hairdressing as well. The number of sick days leave is going to be quickly expanded. We have expanded it to three days. The cumulative cost of everything has been fairly excessive. The Small Business Forum is there to try to balance imposition on small business as well as the cost.  The other issue is the sequential approach to planning and regulations as opposed to a concurrent approach whereby instead of waiting for the planning to be done, agencies do the procurement. Instead of waiting for environmental assessments, doing them all in parallel would speed up a lot of activity. In many instances, we are constantly looking at the avoidance of increased cost for SMEs and trying to slow down the increased costs that have come their way. It is interesting the rate of youth employment has crept up in the past six to nine months. I believe that is related to costs on SMEs.  Deputy Dolan is correct that retrofitting is the most effective way to reduce costs. Between 2019 and September 2025, the Government provided over €1.5 billion in support to homeowners for over 228,000 upgrades, including 30,000 fully funded retrofits under the warmer homes scheme. It is estimated that if a deep retrofit is done, it can save a household up to €1,100 per year in energy costs. I get the Deputy's point that the administration of it needs to be faster. There is also resource demand in respect of it as well with some people not being able to afford to do retrofits because of the cost.  On Deputy Ó Murchú's issue, I do not have the specifics on Ardee Educate Together National School. I do not know what the interaction with the county council is, but in any event----- \n Deputy Ruairí Ó Murchú  The refusal to change----- \n The Taoiseach  They should sort it out. A school is an important facility. The county council should be facilitative in the building of a school. \n Deputy Ruairí Ó Murchú  It is not just the council. \n The Taoiseach  Deputy O'Rourke raised regulation online. We have now established the regulatory framework governing online. There is ongoing review in respect of it. Children must be protected. That has to be the optimal.  Deputy Coppinger raised healthcare assistants and family reunification. We have significant reunification in Ireland under our migration system, in particular when people leave direct provision who have residency. The Minister will bring forward legislation in respect of this and these are issues we can discuss in greater detail at that stage.  On Deputy Murphy's point, I will talk to the Ministers responsible. There has to be proper regulation of management companies. There are fundamental rights involved in terms of those complexes. I will pursue that with the Minister and see where we are in terms of amendment to primary legislation.  Deputy Quaide raised the issue of counselling and psychotherapy. On qualification frameworks and regulators generally, we want more therapists, but they have to be highly qualified. Public health is number one and the protection of the consumer. In some instances, they can be quite protectionist as well. The judgment called for regulators and I would like CORU to get the judgment right in terms of not having the bar so high that there are only highly qualified, and others are not. That is not just in terms of therapy and counselling; that is in terms of teaching and a range of other issues.  Deputy Conway-Walsh raised the regulation of quarries. I will talk to the Minister involved in that. We can overregulate too but I take the Deputy's point about the quality of aggregate and quality of the product. There are existing systems to deal with that. The SEAI is there. There are various regulatory bodies to deal with the quality of materials, but I will talk to the Minister in respect of that. New bodies were set up after the defective blocks scheme.  Deputy Boyd Barrett raised taxi regulation. I will talk to the Minister about the issues that the Deputy raised. There is a balance between consumers, those availing of taxis and the regulation of same. We had regulation a long time ago; it did not work. There was always an imbalance between supply and demand. I will look at this and will talk to the Minister for Transport in respect of it. He is fully aware of it. \n An Ceann Comhairle  We have a delegation of students visiting from Ukraine as our part of our EPAS programme hosted by Maynooth Post Primary School. They are most welcome. We had their president here yesterday, which we enjoyed immensely. ",

        "answerText": " Minister for Transport  The NTA is the independent transport regulator of the small public service vehicle (SPSV) sector, and I am not involved in the day-to-day operations of that sector.  Section 24 of the Consolidated Taxi Regulation Acts 2013 & 2016 empowers the NTA Board to make a “Maximum Fares Order” fixing the maximum fare that may be charged by the driver of a taxi for any journey. The current maximum fares order took effect in December 2024, and a maximum fare review is carried out approximately every 2 years. The NTA has conducted these reviews since 2011. Hackneys and limousines agree their fares in advance and do not use a meter.  The NTA's most recent fare review was undertaken between November 2023 and March 2024. During this review, the NTA took account of the most significant economic issues that were relevant to the SPSV sector which included: inflation and cost of living, fuel prices and energy supply, geopolitical uncertainty and increased public transport availability. Following this review, and a public consultation on the matter, the NTA introduced the Taxi Regulation (Maximum Fares) Order 2024 which increased taxi fares by an average of 9%. This came into operation on 1 December 2024 and ensures that taxi fares continue to reflect the rising costs associated with operating a taxi in Ireland. This increase includes a special rate for the weekend peak, 12 midnight to 4.00am, on Friday night into Saturday morning and Saturday night into Sunday morning, year-round, to incentivise more drivers to service the night-time economy. This followed on from the 2022 Order in which a 12% increase on fares was introduced.  As set out in the legislation, charging more than this maximum fare can lead to a prosecution, however, charging below the maximum fare is permitted.  I issued a letter to the NTA on 19 November last asking that they clarify the regulatory position on fixed price fares for the information of taxi operators and public representatives alike. I also met with the Advisory Committee on SPSVs on 27th November whose role it is to provide advice to the Minister and the NTA in relation to issues relevant to SPSVs and their drivers, where the matter was discussed. I intend to further engage with SPSV sectoral representatives on this issue, once I receive the regulatory clarification from the NTA.  SPSV operators are self-employed and may decide whether (or not) to sign-up with a licensed dispatch operator. They are not obliged to be affiliated with any dispatch operator but where they choose to do so, they are free to contract with a dispatch operator of their choice. ",

Community pharmacies may offer, as a quality initiative, to provide a patient’s medicines in such systems and may charge for this. However, such is a pharmacy arrangement with the patient and is not a State funded service.  There has been a significant focus on improving access to and the affordability of healthcare services over the last few years. This includes reductions in the Drugs Payment Scheme threshold, expansion of access to free GP care, and the abolition of all public in-patient hospital charges for children and adults. These measures continue to create a health and social care service that offers affordable access to quality healthcare.  The Community Pharmacy Agreement 2025 marks a significant milestone in the strategic collaboration between the Department of Health, the HSE, and the IPU. It sets out a comprehensive and ongoing pathway to modernise and expand the role of community pharmacy in Ireland’s healthcare system.  The Agreement is designed to support the delivery of safe, equitable, and efficient healthcare, and to ensure that community pharmacists are better equipped to contribute to national health priorities through structured engagement, sustainable funding, and integrated service delivery.  Under the Agreement, a Strategic Collaboration Group will be established from early 2026 which will provide a structured forum for dialogue and joint consideration of strategic issues shaping the future of community pharmacy in Ireland.  The Agreement also includes the establishment of a rolling annual medicines optimisation programme with dedicated annual funding. The Strategic Collaboration Group will be tasked with exploring the best way to utilise this fund. ",

        "showAs": " 17. Deputy Ruth Coppinger asked the Taoiseach if he will report on the programme plan for his Department's new disability unit for 2025-2027. [63181/25] ",
        "answerText": " An Ceann Comhairle  We have 15 to 16 minutes left. There are 20 Deputies to speak on the next question. I propose to divide the time remaining after the Taoiseach's opening statement between a number of Deputies. \n The Taoiseach  It is a brilliant statement. \n An Ceann Comhairle  The Taoiseach will have to try to be brief. \n The Taoiseach  I jest. \n Deputy Peadar Tóibín  It is all in the delivery. \n The Taoiseach  I will try to cut it short to allow others to come in. I propose to take Questions Nos. 14 to 35, inclusive, together.  I established the disability unit in the Department to bring about a renewed focus and urgency and out of a desire to drive progress on disability issues. The unit's first programme plan, published in September, outlines how the unit will drive the delivery of the Government's new national disability strategy, working across government to make the ambitions a reality. In particular, the unit will look to drive innovation, to get things done, to bring momentum to policy implementation, to troubleshoot, where appropriate, to improve the delivery of services, and to get strategic thinking on future challenges. The unit will also support the Cabinet committee on disability.  The first programme plan for the unit outlines ten priority areas for the period from 2025 to 2027 across five workstreams. The first workstream relates to transforming children's disability services, early years education and health. The second is about increasing system capacity and the third is about opening doors and addressing barriers to employment pathways and supports. The fourth relates to implementing the national disability strategy and the fifth is on planning and designing for the future. The programme plan allows for further workstreams to be assigned to the unit as may be needed.  We do not want to duplicate the work of Ministers or Departments but to support them in improving services and getting things done. It is already up and running. The Cabinet committee on disability has met five times to date. With the support of the unit, we have looked at the new national disability strategy. As the House will know, that has gone through and has now been published. The provision of therapists in special schools is up and running. Some €16 million has been allocated for that this year. There have also been improvements to the delivery of services and the assessment of need process is being reformed, which includes legislative reform.  The budget was impacted by the unit and the Cabinet subcommittee and there was a significant focus on disability, particularly the income disregards for carer's allowance, among other initiatives and payments. The budget also provided a record €3.8 billion allocation towards specialist disability services. This represents a 20% increase year on year. That is to provide permanent dedicated funding for essential disability services. The investment in children's disability services will provide therapy services and strengthen the children's disability network teams through the provision of additional staff and so forth. Some €20 million was targeted at the assessment of need waitlist initiative, providing up to 6,500 clinical assessments. We are developing our budget spotlight on disability. That will be published in due course. It relates to the last budget but will also provide further thinking with regard to future budgets. We are also looking at developments in the area of transport and mobility. We are awaiting proposals from the Departments of Transport and Finance in that regard. \n An Ceann Comhairle  I propose to take the first six Deputies and to allow the Taoiseach six minutes to respond. \n Deputy Pádraig O'Sullivan  This is a topic the Taoiseach is very familiar with. He has visited the Rainbow Club on dozens of occasions at this stage and knows the great work that Jon, Karen and the board do. When Senator Rabbitte was the Minister of State, she was the first to allocate funding to the Rainbow Club under a service level agreement to provide respite care for children. As the Taoiseach will know, every week, over 1,200 children avail of this service, which is provided on a shoestring budget. The Taoiseach will be very familiar with the difficulties the club had in acquiring a nearby site, the former HSE ambulance building. It now has that building and has been lucky enough to engage an architect who is a professional in this field pro bono to design a bespoke building that is fit for the club's purposes. We need to move this project on. We need the HSE and the Government to support it financially to deliver it. It is going to be a massive undertaking for the charity. What is the Taoiseach's office going to do to advance the project? \n Deputy Ruairí Ó Murchú  The National Human Rights Strategy for Disabled People 2025-2030 was launched with great fanfare but we await the action plan. There is much talk of accountability. Will the Taoiseach give me a timeline for the introduction of that action plan? Who will be taking the lead, particularly with regard to oversight and accountability? Will it be the unit, the Cabinet committee or the Department of Children, Disability and Equality? How exactly will it work? How will we see improvements, whether in relation to assessments and therapies or the low level of disabled people who are involved in employment and the need for schemes that actually work? A lot of work is needed to make schemes such as the wage subsidy scheme and the work and access programme fit for purpose. \n Deputy Cian O'Callaghan  The level of unemployment among disabled people in Ireland is among the worst in Europe. I recently met with a number of disabled people in my constituency who have excellent qualifications and skills and who are willing and eager to work but who are stuck in unemployment. There are a number of barriers to employment that need to be removed. We are far behind other European countries in this regard. In 2021, the OECD released a report that made a number of recommendations as to how to tackle this. Those recommendations have still not been implemented. When will they be implemented in full?  What is the Government doing to tackle the scandalously high unemployment levels for disabled people in Ireland? \n Deputy Barry Heneghan  Bhí mé ag caint faoi seo dhá sheachtain ó shin agus an tseachtain seo caite. An rud atá i gceist ná Stapolin Educate Together National School in Baldoyle, which has a petition. Children from the school were in the Dáil last week. It needs two autism classrooms to be sanctioned by the Minister. There are eight children in mainstream classes with eligibility letters and a further 30 in the catchment area who are on waiting lists. This is a huge priority for me and I would love it to be addressed. \n Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett  David and Nicole have a five-year-old son with autism, and an older son. They live in a maisonette, which is 29 sq. m. It is absolutely tiny and rank with damp. Because of his autism, their son has serious sensory processing issues. He is a flight risk. I know these flats well. They have very dangerous concrete steps, which are a serious risk to him. Occupational therapists, medical professionals and people in school have said that he has to be got out of there as he cannot develop or do his occupational therapy if he is living in these conditions. Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council says autism is too prevalent in the community to give it medical priority. That is outrageous. The prevalence of a condition is not a reason to say it is not a priority if the child is in danger. If a child is in danger, it is a priority to get the child out of danger. \n An Ceann Comhairle  I appreciate that. The Taoiseach has the message. \n Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett  I would like there to be an intervention on that. \n Deputy Paul Murphy  The budget was a savage attack on disabled people. It took over €1,000 out of the pockets of disabled people and betrayed the promise in the programme for Government to introduce a permanent annual cost-of-disability support payment. The last time I asked about this, the Taoiseach claimed the cost of disability would be looked at in the next budget. The cost-of-living crisis is now. The cost-of-disability crisis is now. Some 70,000 people who are disabled or have a long-term illness are living in poverty. That is one in three. I have been inundated with emails from disabled people asking for winter cost-of-living and cost-of-disability payment. Many will be forced to choose between heating and eating this Christmas. They also want a permanent cost-of-disability payment without further delay. The Taoiseach has billions of euro in surplus. Do not be a Scrooge this Christmas. Please act on it. \n Deputy Peadar Tóibín  The children's disability network team, CDNT, in Meath is not fully staffed. According to statistics I received today, there are 20 vacant posts across disability teams in Kells, Dunshaughlin, Navan, Slane and Trim. Separate data received by Aontú today show that the Government is actually reducing the number of college places for speech and language therapists, from 370 in the year before Covid to 355 last year. The Government is reducing the number of students filling the necessary college places on an annual basis. What is the Taoiseach saying to parents whose children have been waiting for 14 months to see the CDNT in County Meath and to the children who are being bounced around endlessly from CAMHS, the CDNTs and other services? \n An Ceann Comhairle  Before the Taoiseach replies, could he maybe answer the other Deputies in writing?  Sixteen Deputies did not get to ask questions. They might get some form of response from the Taoiseach. \n The Taoiseach  You can bring some more of them in if you want, a Cheann Comhairle. \n An Ceann Comhairle  Only if the Taoiseach needs less time. We cannot go over the 45 minutes provided. \n The Taoiseach  I am not going to write replies to oral questions. I have given an overall response to everybody. \n An Ceann Comhairle  I am bound by the timelines set down. \n The Taoiseach  Do I have six minutes remaining? \n An Ceann Comhairle  Yes. \n The Taoiseach  I will get around to everybody who has asked a question. \n An Ceann Comhairle  I am talking about the Deputies who have not have not got in. \n Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett  The Taoiseach cannot really answer questions that have not been asked. \n An Ceann Comhairle  I know, but that is it. \n The Taoiseach  It is a new departure if I am going to do a written reply to every oral question. That is not on either. \n An Ceann Comhairle  The Taoiseach should go ahead. I suppose it is just a casualty of how interruptions affect the course of questions. To be fair, the Taoiseach cannot answer a question that has not been asked. We are delaying the answering process. \n Deputy Jennifer Whitmore  Could we even have 30 seconds to ask a question and then maybe the Taoiseach could respond? \n An Ceann Comhairle  No. We cannot go over time. I do not set the time. I do not have that discretion. \n Deputy Jennifer Whitmore  No, but we could stay within the time. \n An Ceann Comhairle  There are 15 Deputies left. \n The Taoiseach  Deputy Pádraig O'Sullivan raised the Rainbow Club, which is doing exceptional work. Jon and Karen O'Mahony have been exceptional leaders in that regard. The former Minister of State, now Senator Rabbitte, did good work on a service level agreement. I was involved in advocating for that building, which was a HSE building, to be allocated to the Rainbow Club. I will certainly continue to work with them and to support them with capital. What is important is that we get a timeline and some idea of how we can progress that as quickly as we possibly can. It is a very good, practical example of how a parent-led, community-based approach can develop services for autism in a nimble and flexible way that has helped so many families.  Deputy Ó Murchú asked about the action plan. That will come.  I do not have an exact date but it is on target. It is fairly imminent. \n Deputy Ruairí Ó Murchú  Who will lead on it? \n An Ceann Comhairle  Please, Deputy Ó Murchú. \n The Taoiseach  The Minister, Deputy Foley, will lead, with the support of the unit in my office, but she will also report to the Cabinet subcommittee, which will then make recommendations to the Cabinet. That is how this will work. The Cabinet subcommittee is very important because all the key Ministers have to be there.  I agree with Deputy Cian O'Callaghan that the unemployment levels among the disability community is too high, and the barriers are too much. Part of the strategy in terms of what I am trying to do with the Minister, Deputy Calleary, is to remove some of those barriers and to create additional supports to make sure that employers are even more incentivised to recruit people. The intention is also to give supports to those who employ people with disabilities on a more sustainable basis. I do not disagree with the Deputy. The historic underemployment of people with disabilities in society is something that is exercising me.  I will pursue the issue raised by Deputy Heneghan about the two autism classes in the Educate Together school in Baldoyle.  I agree with Deputy Boyd Barrett. That is a very strange response from the council referring to the prevalence of autism. Autism is a spectrum, a continuum. There is high-functioning autism, people in the middle and those with autism which is very severe and profound. The council should be able to use the general guidelines in respect of health needs more generally. I am at a loss as to why the council cannot say in this case that the child needs prioritisation and a proper house to facilitate the treatment and life of the child. That is something on which I will go back to the Minister for housing in respect of guidelines to be sent to councils in that respect. I would not have thought it necessary. I thought councils would have enough flexibility to do this.  I disagree with Deputy Paul Murphy's description of the budget as a savage attack, but €3 billion has been invested in special education as an outcome of the budget, as well as €130 million for grants to adapt the houses of older people and disabled people. There was a €10 increase per week in the disability allowance, an expansion of the wage subsidy scheme, an increase of €375 in the income limit for carer's benefit, and a €20 increase in the monthly domiciliary care allowance. That is not a savage attack on disability. We have to pursue the cost of disability and the Minister will bring plans in the next budget in respect of that.  In response to Deputy Tóibín, the vacancy rate nationally has come down for CDNTs. We have increased the allocation of therapy places in third level colleges. \n An Ceann Comhairle  I thank the Taoiseach. Even though there is time left, the point is that this format is not working. The place to discuss that is at the Business Committee on Thursday. I ask Members to bring it up and we can sort out something else. Certainly, where there is a grouping of 19 Members, it is not possible to give the Taoiseach time to answer in the remaining time. I am sorry for those who did not get in but there is just nothing we can do, other than discuss it at the Business Committee and change the format. ",

        "answerText": " Minister of State at the Department of Culture, Communications and Sport  National governing bodies of sport (NGBs) and their overarching international sporting federations are independent, autonomous bodies responsible for the governance of their own sports, including the organisation of sporting fixtures whether in domestic or international competitions.  As such, it's important to make clear that neither the Government nor Sport Ireland has a role in determining who can participate in international competitions organised by international sporting federations. International sporting federations are responsible for determining the composition of their membership in line with their own internal rules. The international federations have a leadership role for their global games and it is at this level that strategic decisions should be taken rather than by individual countries’ NGBs.  On a wider note, I can say that Ireland welcomes the agreement on the first phase of the 20-point plan to end the war in Gaza. The first phase of the plan, the ceasefire and hostage release agreement, is an important step on a road to peace. Our immediate focus must be on ensuring humanitarian aid into and throughout Gaza at scale. Ireland stands ready to play our part in working towards a sustainable peace between Israel and Palestine through the implementation of the two-State solution. ",

        "answerText": " Minister for Education and Youth  A core value of the curriculum, across all levels of schooling in Ireland, is inclusivity and diversity. The curriculum at primary and post-primary is for all learners, from all backgrounds – regardless of gender, socioeconomic background, race or creed. It aims to foster inclusivity where equality and diversity are promoted.  The National Council for Curriculum and Assessment plays a key role in the development of the curriculum for early childhood education, primary schools and post-primary schools. Inclusion and diversity is called out as a key principle of the NCCA’s work.  In recent years, the diversity of our school communities has been added to through immigration. At primary level, Social and Environmental Education explores social, environmental, cultural, religious and political themes through history and geography. It is framed by global learning themes which include human rights, democracy, equity, social and environmental justice and sustainable development.  Social and Environmental Education looks at personal, Irish, European and global issues—past, present and future. It helps children understand local, national and global events and challenges, and supports them in becoming active, informed, and responsible citizens who value and care for the world around them. It includes an awareness of the motivation for people’s migration to and from Ireland over time and the impact of these movements.  The inclusion of learning about religions, beliefs and worldviews is to support children’s awareness, appreciation and understanding of the rich diversity of religions, beliefs and worldviews in different times, places and circumstances. Worldviews are a framework of beliefs, values and attitudes that can be religious, philosophical, moral, personal, or a combination of these.  Inclusive education and diversity is one of the key principles of the Primary Curriculum Framework. Inclusive education provides for equity of opportunity and participation in every child’s learning, celebrating diversity and responding to the uniqueness of each learner.  The new Primary Wellbeing Curriculum, which includes Social, Personal and Health Education (SPHE), places inclusion and diversity at its core. It recognises the rich diversity of cultures, identities, backgrounds, and families represented within Irish classrooms and ensures that no child is discriminated against on the basis of gender, family status, sexual orientation, religion, age, disability, race, or membership of the Traveller community.  The curriculum aims to create equitable and inclusive learning environments where all children feel valued, respected, and empowered to contribute to their communities. It supports the development of children as active citizens, fostering empathy, teamwork, fairness, and respect for diversity. Key features of the curriculum include challenging stereotypes and recognising and affirming diversity within classrooms and the wider society.  For post-primary level, the NCCA is currently reviewing and updating the Intercultural Guidelines for primary and post-primary schools to support the further integration of intercultural education in the curriculum. The guidelines will be updated this year.  Many subjects that students take at both junior and senior cycle are based on learning outcomes which allow teachers autonomy to work with students in choosing themes that are of interest or relevance to students’ lives. As some issues become topical in society and prominent in the media, teachers can adjust their plans to reflect this and bring these issues into the classroom. The way these courses are designed means that recent political or social developments can be discussed in the classroom and can be incorporated into the curriculum.  Regarding our anti-bulling initiative, Cineáltas : Action Plan on Bullying , was published on 1st December 2022. Cineáltas is my department’s whole-education approach to preventing and addressing bullying behaviour in schools.  Cineáltas is dedicated to the prevention and addressing of bullying behaviour including cyber bullying, racist bullying, gender identity bullying and sexual harassment, among other areas, in schools. It is centred on a child rights-based approach and provides a collective vision and clear roadmap for how the whole education community and society can work together to prevent and address bullying behaviour in our schools.  The Bí Cineálta procedures are centred on a child rights-based approach and support a partnership approach where all members of the school community work together to prevent and address bullying behaviour. The procedures have been updated to take account of gender identity bullying, cyberbullying, racist bullying, sexist bullying, and sexual harassment. They support schools to develop clear strategies to prevent and address these bullying behaviours. The Bí Cineálta procedures must be implemented in schools by the beginning of the 2025-26 school year.  We also have the Delivering Equality of Opportunity in Schools, or DEIS, programme. Tackling educational disadvantage and helping students reach their full potential is a key priority for me as Minister for Education and Youth and for Government. Currently, the DEIS programme supports almost 1,200 primary and post-primary schools, reaching approximately 260,000 students, with an annual investment of over €180 million. Budget 2026 allocates an additional €16 million in 2026, rising to €48 million in 2027, to support the implementation of the new DEIS Strategy and introduce the DEIS Plus scheme, which will commence in 2026.  The new DEIS Strategy will set out the Department of Education and Youth’s strategic vision, goals, and objectives to tackle educational disadvantage in all schools. The Strategy has a focus on developing more innovative approaches and working towards a more flexible system of support to ensure that all schools can receive the right support at the right time. This will involve a more dynamic resource allocation model where levels of resources more accurately follow the levels of need identified by objective data.  The DEIS Plus scheme will provide additional support to schools with the highest levels of need, in line with the Government’s commitment. It will target a cohort of schools with high concentrations of children and young people experiencing intergenerational disadvantage where there is a significant gap in outcomes and there are barriers to those children and young people achieving their potential.  The details of the DEIS Plus scheme are currently being finalised within an overall programme of work to tackle educational disadvantage and will be outlined in the new DEIS Strategy, which will be published before the end of the year. Future allocation of overall resources will be considered within the context of the new DEIS Strategy and the availability of resources. ",

This measure is intended to support the management of the symptoms of menopause and, therefore, relates to the provision of treatment for the symptoms a specific medical condition/life stage i.e. menopause. HRT is the most commonly used treatment for managing symptoms of menopause and has shown to be the most effective intervention.  I am aware that HRT is used in the treatment of other medical conditions/circumstances, including gender-affirming healthcare, hypogonadism, IVF, and some cancer treatments. However, the current provision of the Free HRT Arrangement, legislated for under the Health Insurance (Amendment) and Health (Provision of Menopause Products) Act 2024, limits eligibility to those whose healthcare provider has prescribed HRT to alleviate the symptoms of menopause. The legislation does not make amendments to what must be included in a prescription for it to be considered valid.  I am not in a position to comment on or intervene in individual cases, patient’s prescriptions, or decisions made by individual pharmacists in the exercise of their professional judgement.  Pharmacists have a legal and ethical responsibility to ensure that each dispensing is safe, appropriate, and in the best interests of the patient. These responsibilities are reflected in the [ , ] which sets out the principles of professional practice expected of all pharmacists in Ireland. In particular, Principle 2 of the Code outlines the obligation to “provide safe and effective care,” and Principle 5 emphasises the need to “exercise professional judgment in the best interests of patients.”  These principles require pharmacists to consider, at each dispensing, not only the legal validity of the prescription, but also whether the continued supply of the medicine is clinically appropriate. This includes situations where the full 12-month supply may not be dispensed if, in the pharmacist’s judgement, further assessment is needed, or where clarity from the prescriber may be required.  Where a member of the public believes that a pharmacist has not acted appropriately or has not complied with their legal or professional obligations, they are entitled to make a complaint to the PSI. All complaints received are considered in accordance with the provisions of the Pharmacy Act 2007. A decision not to progress a complaint does not suggest that the concerns were not considered seriously, but rather that the statutory threshold for further action under section 36(1) of the Act was not met.  Alternatively, outside of the statutory complaints process, anyone can raise a concern with the PSI about the behaviour, conduct or practice of a pharmacist, or the service they have received in a pharmacy. All concerns are formally reviewed by the PSI to consider whether further action is needed. In these situations, those raising the concern are not kept informed of the outcomes of the internal reviews/actions taken by PSI. Further information is available on the PSI’s [ website. ] ",

        "answerText": " The Taoiseach  I propose to take Questions Nos. 1 to 16, inclusive, together.  The Cabinet Committee on water quality oversees implementation of the programme for Government commitments in relation to the range of issues affecting Ireland’s water system. The committee last met on 30 October and the date of its next meeting has not yet been scheduled. The committee is informed by the work of the Environmental Protection Agency, EPA, which monitors and reports on water quality in Ireland. The EPA recently published its report Water Quality in Ireland 2019-2024, which shows water quality improvements in some areas but also an overall decline in waterbodies in a satisfactory ecological condition. While the overall ecological status of Ireland’s waters is significantly better than the European Union average, the downward trend is a matter of concern. The report shows that targeted actions in the agricultural sector and improvements in wastewater treatment appear to be paying dividends, with lower reported levels of nutrients in water bodies where targeted actions have been taken.  The Cabinet committee has also examined the investment programme of Uisce Éireann to improve wastewater treatment capacity and meet best practice in managing its existing infrastructure. Last week, the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage published a sectoral plan for water services and water quality. This includes record investment of €12.2 billion, largely allocated to Uisce Éireann to support the delivery of the additional water services capacity required to deliver the Government's housing plan and to improve water quality. This investment will help to deliver the Government water action plan, Ireland's roadmap to protect and restore our rivers, lakes, estuaries, coastal waters and ground waters.  Last year, the Government also published Water and Agriculture: A Collaborative Approach, and this report sets out measures to address the twin objectives of improving water quality and demonstrating that a robust case exists for the maintenance of a derogation for Ireland from certain aspects of the EU nitrates directive. In October, the Minister, Deputy Browne, published a draft nitrates action programme, which will form the basis of Ireland’s ongoing discussions with the European Commission on a new derogation. The Minister has invited submissions from the public on its contents. A public consultation process on the strategic environmental assessment and appropriate assessment of the plan is also live, with submissions invited by 1 December.  European Union environmental Commissioner Roswall visited Ireland last week and met with the Minister, Deputy Heydon, as well as farmers and other stakeholders to discuss Ireland's application for a derogation and the importance of its continuation to Ireland's outdoor, grass-based livestock systems. The visit provided an opportunity for the Commissioner to visit a farm in County Kildare to see at first hand the efforts towards improving water quality and to engage with public representatives and stakeholders. Discussions with the Commission are ongoing to find an approach that facilitates the continuation of high-quality dairy and beef production by derogation farmers while ensuring sufficient protection for the quality and ecological status of our rivers, lakes and estuaries. \n An Ceann Comhairle  We have 16 speakers. They have a minute each and I ask them to be as concise as possible. I call on Deputy Cleere. \n Deputy Peter 'Chap' Cleere  Last week, we saw serious disruption for towns and villages like Thomastown, Graiguenamanagh, Inistioge and Freshford, which are currently faced with significant backlogs for the implementation of effective flood relief schemes. I acknowledge there has been extensive consultations with local communities to achieve a solution that satisfies those communities and the needs of the local environment. However, the delivery has been delayed far too long. The conversation needs to move to action. It is all about implementation and delivering effective solutions for these communities at risk.  Let me give the Taoiseach a brief example. In Graiguenamanagh, my own town, there was a major flood issue in 2016. In 2018, funding was announced. In 2020, a design team was assigned. We are now in November 2025, and we have not even gone for planning permission yet. It is anticipated that the planning process will take two years. Construction will then start at the end of 2028, with a two-year timeframe for completion. That just gives an example of the length of time these projects are taking. \n An Ceann Comhairle  The Deputy has five seconds. \n Deputy Peter 'Chap' Cleere  I understand that fish life is important, but what about the lives of Johnny and Mary, living in a house that has been flooded? The people in Freshford, Graiguenamanagh, Thomastown and Inistioge are going to bed at night from November to March wondering if their houses will be flooded come the morning. \n An Ceann Comhairle  I thank the Deputy. \n Deputy Peter 'Chap' Cleere  The injustice to these communities has gone on far too long. \n Deputy Aindrias Moynihan  Farmers are very keen to improve water quality. The recent oversubscription of environmental schemes reflects that appetite. Our grass-based system differs very much from what would be found across Europe. Family farms right across Ireland need to be able to plan for the year ahead and the nitrates derogation is very much part of the planning for the day-to-day operation of the farms. Farmers are really keen to know where they stand and they are going to need to know that for the start of the year. Retaining this derogation is vital. I very much impressed this on Commissioner Roswall during her recent visit to Ireland. She did acknowledge that progress had been made but she was also keen to see that there would be ongoing progress and improvements. Will the Minister and the Government be able to win support across EU colleagues to ensure the derogation will be retained? Additionally, farmers are also being told they are not alone in respect of improving water quality. They are keen to pull their weight and they will, but they also need to know that municipal waste inputs and Irish Water will also pull their weight. \n Deputy Paul Murphy  Two years ago, I raised with the Taoiseach a repeated problem of sewage overflowing in Dodder Valley Park beside Balrothery weir. When there is heavy rainfall, the sewage shoots out beside a residential area in a beautiful park. It is still happening. It happened again last weekend with the heavy rainfall. In March 2024, I got a reply from Uisce Éireann accepting that it was impacting the environment and posing a risk to public health through flooding. At that time, it said it was at stage 3 of a four-stage process and it would have options and costings in quarter 4 of 2024. In August 2024, I followed up on this matter. I got a response in February of this year, over six months after the promised commencement of stage 4. The company apologised for the delay and said it was concluding stage 3 and moving into stage 4. I have followed up again with the company. It is simply unacceptable that the health of residents and park users is put at risk and that the deadlines for action keep getting delayed. Does the Taoiseach agree that Irish Water, Uisce Éireann, must act? \n Deputy Ruairí Ó Murchú  I would like to use this time to remember Chloe McGee, Chloe Hipson, Dylan Commins, Shay Duffy and Alan McCluskey. Ar dheis Dé go raibh a n-anamacha dílse. We think of their families and friends. It is going to be a very difficult time over the next couple of days for communities right across counties Louth, Monaghan and Meath. I have been in O'Fiaich College and DkIT and seen huge supports for students and staff. It was the same in the Sean McDermotts club last night also. This is the level of resilience we will see. My thoughts go out to those affected by what has been an absolutely desperate tragedy. I also think of those injured. We hope for a speedy recovery. Beyond that, we think of the emergency services, whose members saw things nobody should have to see. \n An Ceann Comhairle  Go raibh maith agat. I appreciate that yesterday's proceedings overtook us and we did not get to pay our due respects. What the Deputy said goes for us all. I thank him. I call on Deputy Conor D. McGuinness. \n Deputy Conor D. McGuinness  Go raibh maith agat. I want to raise with the Taoiseach the situation of two households living in Lyre, Mahon Bridge, County Waterford. They live in two adjoining council-built cottages constructed in 1949. At the time, the local authority installed a water supply from an open stream flowing off the Comeragh Mountains, and that is still their only source of water 75 years later. It is untreated and coming from a roadside stream. The water runs black and is full of silt, filth and worse. Each of the men has pulled dead rats and badgers from it on occasion. The supply is so unsafe that the health authorities have warned them not to even wash their hands with it.  I have raised this directly with the Minister for housing and with Uisce Éireann. A brand new public mains runs just 500 m from the townland of Fews across from these men's homes. Connecting these homes would require just a short bore under a regional road but Uisce Éireann has refused to fund it and instead told residents to apply for a private well grant. Unfortunately, the land in the area they live in is not suitable for a private well and they have that on good authority from several professional well drillers. Will the Taoiseach please act in the interests of these two households and instruct Uisce Éireann? I will show the Taoiseach, very briefly, a bottle with a sample of water they provided me with recently. It illustrates the depth of what their public water supply is. \n An Ceann Comhairle  Deputy, we do not allow displays of such nature but I understand it is your first time. I call Deputy Barry Heneghan. \n Deputy Barry Heneghan  I have raised the issue of water quality in Dublin Bay time and time again. I am not going to just single out the north side. This is a north and south Dublin problem. We saw the rain that fell at the weekend. We have all seen the drone footage of the bay being polluted. I have swimmers whose only way of socialising is getting into that water and having the chats but the E. coli levels are not acceptable at the moment. In Dublin Bay and with the way the plumes work with the tides, the north side is affected worse when there is a high level. Some of these constituents are here today with the visual artists from Palestine who raised money for Artists Without Borders in Clontarf Castle. They are going to be swimming in that water. These are the people who need this water protected. We see in Dún Laoghaire that oysters are being brought in to treat the water. Can we get that on the north side as well? I have a mandate for that. It was on my four-pager. Oysters are great natural filters of E. coli and other contaminants. \n Deputy Rose Conway-Walsh  The EU drinking water regulations came into effect in Irish law in March 2023. \n The Taoiseach  Sorry, the which? \n Deputy Rose Conway-Walsh  The EU drinking water regulations. I raise it in the context of the ongoing intolerable situation where 500 households in Ballycroy and Inishbiggle, in County Mayo are left without water for days on end. The way to solve this is to allow some flexibility in the multi-annual water programme to enable moneys that have been returned to the Department, or are to be returned to the Department, from one scheme can be reallocated to another scheme that desperately needs it. There is a gravity-fed group scheme in Ballycroy and it is run by volunteers. What has happened is some of the volunteers have passed away so they are trying to reconfigure the volunteers in the parish to be able to apply for the necessary funding. There is a way to solve this. Mayo County Council applied for emergency funding earlier this year but was unsuccessful so we need emergency funding and some flexibility around the framework. \n Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett  I also wish to raise the issue of water quality in Dublin Bay, for the umpteenth time. Every time there is a massive downpour like the ones we had very recently, rainfall water or stormwater mixes with sewage and pours into Dublin Bay. The pumping station at the west pier in Dún Laoghaire pumps stuff out to Ringsend but Ringsend does not have the capacity. It overflows, goes into Dublin Bay and then water quality is very seriously undermined.  I was looking at a question I asked back in 2019, and it was not the first time. Even then, the Government was promising it was going to upgrade Ringsend. That was 2019 and it still has not been done. It still happens every time it rains. It is unbelievable. When is the Government finally going to make sure that the upgrade at Ringsend and the rehabilitation of our decrepit water infrastructure, which is jeopardising water quality, swimmers and health and causing all sorts of bad, adverse problems, is going to be finally addressed by this Government? \n Deputy Liam Quaide  I know the Taoiseach will reject the claim that rural Ireland is being left behind by his Government but many residents of the village of Ballyhooly in my constituency beg to differ. They have good reason to. The very basic need for a consistent supply of water to drink, bathe in or use in appliances such as dishwashers and showers has been denied to them for many years. Residents in Ballyhooly have to deal with extremely low water pressure alternating with a non-existent supply of water for prolonged periods. This has hit people with chronic illness, disability and age-related care needs the hardest. It has also severely impacted the local school and farming community. In recent months, there has been a reprieve from a full-scale outage but water pressure remains very low and there is no clear timeframe on the extent of works required to resolve the issue. Short-term fixes will no longer cut it for Ballyhooly. When are we going to see movement on this essential project that will allow the village to thrive? \n Deputy Erin McGreehan  Along with my constituency colleague, I want to pay respects to those poor five souls, the young people who lost their lives in the car accident at the weekend: Chloe McGee, Shay Duffy, Alan McCluskey, Dylan Commins and Chloe Hipson. It is a desperate loss for their families, friends, work colleagues and everybody. I only hope their families can find the strength to walk along the pain and agony that comes upon a family when they lose someone so tragically. It seems almost futile and frivolous to mention it during a discussion on water quality.  I have raised on several occasions the state of the water and rivers around Dundalk Bay. Research was published recently in a local newsletter spelling out clearly issues around repeated sewage discharge and wastewater plants operating beyond capacity, with visible waste near Blackrock and protected habitats being steadily damaged. People are seeing it, smelling it and living beside it. As the Taoiseach knows, I raise these concerns regularly and I get very dismissive responses from Irish Water. I often feel almost gaslit by them. I hope that when the Cabinet committee is working on water quality with the infrastructure Department that it will consider fast-tracking projects to make sure our water quality is up to standard. \n Deputy Peadar Tóibín  Keeping the lights and on and water in the taps is surely one of the basic responsibilities of any administration but we live in a country where that is simply not happening. For a country where it seldom stops raining, it hardly goes a week before there is a water or hosepipe ban in this country. In my county of Meath, things are out of control currently. As we speak, a burst mains causing major disruption in Navan. There are multiple outages every week in the system in Enfield. People in Trim can hardly turn the water taps on because of discoloured water or bans on water being used at certain times of the day, etc. Councillor Dave Boyne and I have had to campaign to get water trucks to bring water to other towns in the county. The Taoiseach talks about massive investment, which is welcome, but it is not making a difference on the ground because there are major problems for Irish Water to deliver on infrastructure in terms of planning, permits and tendering etc. When will those be fixed so we can get the system fixed? \n Deputy Paul Lawless  I have raised this many times previously but the water quality in Clew Bay, County Mayo is being massively damaged at the moment. Raw sewage from Newport town is collected and stored in containers. When the high tide comes in to Clew Bay, it washes raw sewage on to the shoreline. Everyone is in agreement that a water treatment plant is needed for the town and it has been in the planning process for decades. There are significant issues in relation to the Maritime Area Regulatory Authority, MARA, which is not meeting its statutory timelines, and indeed Uisce Éireann. It appears that what is happening is a letter-writing club between the two organisations, with no progress being made. I have raised this previously and I ask the Taoiseach to intervene. We cannot have critical infrastructure delayed for decades as a result. I have raised this with Uisce Éireann and MARA but it is time the Government intervened and injected some urgency into this. \n The Taoiseach  I thank all of the Deputies. A comprehensive number spoke in respect of the responsibilities of Irish Water, particularly in terms of wastewater treatment plants and flood relief schemes.  Deputy 'Chap' Cleere raised the issue of a series of flood relief schemes in his constituency. I do not know why the planning process should take two years and that is something we need to analyse further but measures will come to Government in respect of critical infrastructure in the next number of weeks. Flood relief schemes are taking too long because the urgency is very real.  Given the worsening climate, we have more frequent storms and rainfall that is heavier and comes in short bursts and that is creating huge pressure on our systems. I have been to many flooding scenes where the devastation is appalling and negatively impacts on households and businesses. We then have consequential compensation schemes and everything we try to do to alleviate the pressure but there is nothing worse than being the victim of a flooding incident. I will take a look at those schemes and talk to the Minister of State with responsibility for the OPW, Deputy Moran, to see how we can accelerate this. We are also looking at a critical infrastructure Bill and will see whether we can include wastewater and flood relief schemes.  Deputy Aindrias Moynihan raised the derogation and I fully agree with him that retaining the derogation is vital for farm families and for the food production system and the dairy industry. We need a sustainable farming industry but farmers are working with us on various water improvement schemes under the European Union framework and have being doing a lot to measure and assess this work. I have had discussions with the President of the European Commission explaining the unique position in Ireland because we have a pasture-based system that is outdoors more than indoors. Most other European systems are indoors. The Minister for agriculture, Deputy Heydon, has been working with Commissioner Roswall, who came to Ireland last week. She met farmers in Kildare and saw first-hand the measures we are taking to make farming and agriculture more sustainable. We know farmers do need to know. I take the Deputy's point in respect of other contributors to waste and I met representatives of Irish Water recently in the context of the Cabinet subcommittee meeting. Representatives from the Environmental Protection Agency were there as well. In my view, Irish Water has to get it right in respect of its own actions. It cannot contribute negatively to water quality, being a water body itself, nor can local authorities. They also certainly need to step up to the plate in protecting our waterways.  Deputy Murphy raised the issue of Balrothery estate in terms of sewerage overflow. Again, I will talk to Irish Water in respect of where that is at. We have allocated unprecedented resources to Irish Water as a result of the national development plan and we have given it multi-annual funding. Irish Water knows what its funding will be for the next five years, which should enable staff to get on, to plan and do things. There is a lot of work to be done. Our population is growing exponentially, and has grown during the past two decades. That is creating pressure on water services. What will be important as well, for those who correctly referenced wastewater treatment plants, is that we have to try to create a narrative and a consensus in society not to object to wastewater treatment plants, to their upgrade or to supply projects. An awful lot of these projects are getting snarled up in planning and being delayed for far too long. What is happening in the preparation of the schemes, stage III to stage IV, is that everybody is dotting the i's and crossing the t's because they are anticipating an objection or a judicial review so they want to make sure they can be resilient in the face of a court case being heard or a judicial review of a decision taken during the planning process. What we are getting is a very slow process in getting projects through. We will have to deal with that and the Government is determined to deal with that because we have to push ahead. Even on a small issue like apartment guidelines, and we had it earlier this afternoon during Leaders' Questions, we get public representatives judicially reviewing regulation. Then people complain about things not moving. We cannot have it our own way, every way, but that is a general comment on where we are and it is important.  Deputies Ó Murchú and McGreehan correctly articulated all of our shock and horror at the devastating accident in Louth. Five young lives were lost. They were going out for a nice evening. We are all parents and we are all afraid of something like that happening when our young people go out and so on and we all want them to come home. On this occasion, they did not come home and the impacts on the parents are beyond comprehension. It is very difficult for them. We hope the beautiful memories they had with their young children will sustain them in the time ahead. I thank the Deputies for raising this in the House.  In regard to Deputy McGuinness's contribution, I will talk to Irish Water. I cannot get involved in every single case. This relates to two houses. Surely the county council and Irish Water should knock heads together and get that issue sorted if the water mains are 500 m away.  Deputy Heneghan has left the Chamber. He has gone with the swimmers; I would say they are gone too. Deputy Boyd Barrett raised the issue of Dublin Bay as well. It is a very serious issue. E.coli levels are too high and when there is heavy rain. people cannot swim. That is not satisfactory. I am back to the issue that we need wastewater treatment plants. The whole Dublin water project is being judicially reviewed. The Arklow wastewater treatment plant was conceived at the same time as the Dublin scheme. It has opened - I opened it - and the Dublin scheme has not even gotten off the ground. There are other projects of that kind we need to get off the ground and to get going. The points were well made by Deputies Boyd Barrett and Heneghan in that regard.  In terms of the drinking water regulation and the 500 households, again it is a specific issue and I will talk to Irish Water in respect of that. \n Deputy Rose Conway-Walsh  That is not Irish Water \n The Taoiseach  Is it a group scheme? \n Deputy Rose Conway-Walsh  It is a group scheme. \n The Taoiseach  The Deputy wants flexibility in the multi-annual funding. I will talk to the Minister to see whether there is anything that can be done there or not. \n Deputy Rose Conway-Walsh  Thank you. \n The Taoiseach  There is a combination of issues in terms of the reconstitution of the group of volunteers. Deputy Boyd Barrett raised the issue that Ringsend does not have capacity. We have been engaging and have appointed----- \n Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett  It has been going on for years. \n The Taoiseach  I know and we have allocated billions of euro now so hopefully we can get it done.  Deputy Quaide raised the issue of Balyhooly and the basic quality of water. I have spoken to Irish Water representatives about the Cork situation more generally in terms of water quality issues and they are working on that.  Deputy McGreehan again raised the issue of habitats and Dundalk Bay. Again, I asked Irish Water to engage with public representatives. All State agencies should engage with public representatives in a respectful and engaging way and should give proper responses. The State funds these agencies. In many ways they are created as agencies to get things done but that should not absolve the agencies then of their responsibilities to communicate to democratically elected Deputies and Senators or indeed councillors on the local authorities as well. I will have a look at what the story is in Dundalk Bay.  Deputy Tóibín raised the issue of Trim again in terms of keeping the taps on and water quality. Again, it relates to wider issues. They had the plan, we have now funded the plan, and the issue now is getting things done as quickly as we can.  Deputy Lawless raised Clew Bay and Newport. Again, it is about getting the infrastructure in place as quickly as we can. I will relay all of those to Irish Water for a response. \n An Ceann Comhairle  I thank the Taoiseach. We will move to the next questions, which is the grouping of Question Nos. 17 to 31, inclusive, to ask the Taoiseach for a report on the work of the shared island unit. We have 17 minutes and 14 seconds left. ",

        "answerText": " The Taoiseach  I propose to take Questions Nos. 17 to 31, inclusive, together.  Our programme for Government sets out an ambitious agenda for building our shared island. Yesterday, the Government made a major funding commitment of over €50 million through our shared island fund to ten new programmes.  We are investing for the future to improve people’s lives and strengthen connections across the island of Ireland . We are moving forward with €14 million for a major new shared island media initiative by Coimisiún na Meán, delivering on our programme for Government commitment to resource schemes to encourage cross-Border journalism on an ongoing basis;  A sum of €5.9 million is being allocated to the fire and emergency services from North and South to deepen their co-operation to enhance capacity and training on management of flooding events  and on search and rescue operations. There will be €6 million for the new shared home place programme, which will foster a sustained, broad engagement with all communities on this island and with our diaspora on the island of Ireland’s diverse heritage, and how this can shape our shared future. Funding of €14.5 million is being allocated for an expanded creative lreland shared island programme and arts projects. There will be a €1.8 million contribution to the next phase of the all-Ireland pollinator plan to protect the island’s unique biodiversity.  Ministers are also working with confirmed shared island fund resourcing to establish a new air link between Derry and Dublin next year; support development of new cross-Border and Border region greenway routes; deepen our co-operation with Northern Ireland Executive counterparts on tackling bovine TB, the information service for cross-Border workers and commercialising research. The Government also yesterday, as part of the national development plan review, published our shared island investment priorities across virtually all sectors out to 2035, backed by our shared island fund and other resourcing.  The iconic Narrow Water Bridge and Ulster Canal restoration projects are forging ahead. Next year, Government resourcing will enable commencement of construction of a new teaching building at Ulster University in Derry and continue the transformative hourly frequency Dublin to Belfast rail service. In April, I launched a new phase of my Department’s joint research programme with the Economic and Social Research Institute, ESRI, with a focus on strategic policy and co-operation considerations for the island, and research projects for 2025-26 are under way. This includes a new annual report series by the ESRI assessing economic trends across the island of Ireland, which will be published next month.  Through our shared island Initiative, the Government will continue to invest in strategic all-island co-operation and deepen our partnership with the Executive and UK Government as we work every day to build reconciliation between the different traditions of this island. \n Deputy Erin McGreehan  The shared island unit has real potential and has had real results and benefits for County Louth and the country, as the Taoiseach said, in terms of the arts, emergency services and biodiversity. Yesterday's announcement that Dundalk Institute of Technology, DKIT, will gain university status alongside Queen's University Belfast is incredibly exciting news. It will be transformative for the north east, and will be a really complementary match-up with Queen's University as well. This is a huge opportunity for the shared island unit to invest in the future, to invest in our young people and to invest in our economy and our industry.  I wish to ask the Taoiseach about the investment in people and about deeper health care co-operation with our neighbours in the North. There have to be synergies and opportunities there that we can look at with Daisy Hill Hospital in Newry and even further afield in Dundalk. We can start looking at how we can look after the communities in the Cooley Peninsula, Carlingford and Omeath, and how we can reflect this in our usual daily life and health care. They do not match up at the minute and we can do more. \n Deputy Cormac Devlin  I thank the Taoiseach for the reply and in particular the announcement of €50 million for the new projects, which is very welcome. We need to see more of the practical people-focused projects like those. The Taoiseach mentioned the Dublin-Derry link among other initiatives. The Enterprise rail link between Dublin and Belfast has proven very popular. I ask that it be considered to extend that further to support the night-time economy of both cities. That would be a very important move.  In the same spirit, the announcement by Minister for higher education, Deputy Lawless, of a major new partnership between Dundalk IT and Queen's University, establishing DKIT as a University College of Queen's University is a landmark development for higher education and for the Dublin-Belfast corridor. Will the Taoiseach set out how these shared island allocations and DKIT-Queen's partnership will be aligned as part of a cohort plan for the Dublin-Belfast corridor? Will the Taoiseach confirm that the necessary policy and legislative frameworks will be brought to Government early in 2026 so that students, staff and local communities can see these benefits on the ground as quickly as possible? \n Deputy Paul Murphy  I will quote the Taoiseach who told an international audience at COP30:  The science is undeniable. Temperatures are rising, and the clock is ticking. If we are not prepared to tell our citizens the truth about this, we are failing them, and this planet, in the most profound way.  Has the Taoiseach tried telling the truth to the big dairy farmers and the big dairy processors who are driving up carbon emissions and are polluting our waterways, North and South? I have raised the issue previously in terms of Lough Neagh. Lough Derg is the latest of our lakes to turn neon green, a 41st shade of green that the Taoiseach will not be plámásing world leaders about. The main cause is nutrient pollution from agriculture, accelerated by the nitrates derogation. When will the Taoiseach tell the truth that environmental protection and intensive for-profit animal agriculture are incompatible, that we need to reduce the number of dairy cattle, that we need to compensate farmers with a herd reduction scheme and that the nitrates derogation must go? \n An Ceann Comhairle  I will just pause the clock for a minute. We have only eight minutes left in this session and we cannot go over time, I am afraid. I do not have that discretion for Taoiseach's Questions. I will have to limit each Member's contribution to 30 seconds give the Taoiseach an opportunity to respond. \n Deputy Ruairí Ó Murchú  I would like to bring up the fabulous news about the partnership between DKIT and Queen's University. We are talking about a greater level of provision of undergraduate and postgraduate programmes and an innovation and research hub to be based in Dundalk. We know that this can definitely develop the Dublin-Belfast corridor. There is a necessity to follow through with legislative support. Beyond that, this could be part of a vital shared island project. I would like to know what will happen in that regard. \n Deputy Michael Murphy  The question of greater North-South integration and any future constitutional change carries profound economic implications. It is really important that we approach this debate with honesty and clarity. Further integration will require significant investment, aligning public services, connecting infrastructure, integrating health and education and ensuring social welfare compatibility. If we are to maintain public confidence, we need transparent, independent economic analysis. We need to be honest about the challenges and the opportunities. \n Deputy Liam Quaide  In recent times we have seen an alarming escalation in racist violence against immigrants and minority communities both North and South of this island. According to An Garda Síochána statistics, race crimes and related incidents rose by 24% between 2021 and 2024. There were similar increases in such crimes in the North between July 2024 and June of this year. Amnesty International has described this period in the North as \"a year of hate and fear\". There is a striking similarity of experiences of minorities both North and South in respect of these increased threats. There is also clear potential to collaborate on an all-island basis. What initiatives are under way or planned to help support integration through communities North and South to help them learn from each other in terms of best practice? \n Deputy Shane Moynihan  Yesterday's announcement is very welcome in terms of the infrastructure foundations put in place to harness the economic potential of the shared island. Part of that, which we have discussed in this House, is the role of the all-island labour market and the need for focus and skills. I would love to hear from the Taoiseach about what engagement is happening with the Northern Ireland Executive with regard to building up the SME sector across both sides of the island. They will be the fabric that knit the economic fabric of this island together in creating the shared island and creating a shared and united future for all. What schemes are being put in place to incentivise and promote that? \n Deputy Rose Conway-Walsh  I commend the work of Dublin City University, Aberdeen University and University College Dublin on the constitutional deliberations from grassroots that is being done by Dr. Shelley Deane, Professor Joanne McEvoy and Professor Jennifer Todd. I raise this because this work has been done with focus groups in Mayo, Bellaghy, Longford, Cookstown and Monaghan. The shared island unit, which is very much welcome, is doing work on women and the Constitution. I ask that the unit uses this academic work to underpin what the unit is going to do. The credibility of the work the academics are doing would really carry this forward. Why has it not got academic underpinning? \n Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett  Across Britain and the North of Ireland people are being arrested, prosecuted and, in some cases, imprisoned because they support Palestine Action, on the basis that the British Government has designated Palestine Action, a group campaigning against British complicity with the genocide that Israel is committing, as a terrorist organisation. It is absolutely outrageous. There will be a protest this Saturday in Belfast as people stand in solidarity with it. Sally Rooney has written an article in The Guardian this week about prisoners being close enough to being tortured in British prisons who are in prison awaiting trial on this. Will the Taoiseach speak out against the British Government's outrageous decision to designate protesting against genocide as somehow terrorism? \n Deputy Peadar Tóibín  BBC Northern Ireland runs a podcast called \"Borderline\". The podcast is part of the significant debate on Irish unity that is happening across the country. One of the themes of that podcast is the fact that the Irish Government is not participating in that discussion.  Many voices have stated there is a serious reluctance from the Government to even discuss the issue of Irish unity. The debate has moved on. People North and South are now talking about what planning and preparation is necessary for the referendum to be held. Brexit shows the danger of holding a referendum without doing the planning and preparation in the first place. \n An Ceann Comhairle  Thank you, Deputy. I call Deputy Lawless. \n Deputy Peadar Tóibín  This morning the BBC mentioned that the Irish Government is the only place where this planning and preparation could happen. \n An Ceann Comhairle  Deputy Lawless. \n Deputy Peadar Tóibín  When will the Taoiseach step up to the plate? \n Deputy Paul Lawless  I want to raise concerns about the Supreme Court ruling in Britain on religious education and collective worship in the North of Ireland. Aontú is a pluralist republican party. I believe it is really important that all parents can choose the ethos of the school they wish to send their children to. Catholic schools played a significant role in the lives of nationalist families. They were a safe place for Catholics in the North and promoted the Irish language and games. \n An Ceann Comhairle  Thank you, Deputy. \n Deputy Paul Lawless  Will the Taoiseach engage with his counterpart----- \n An Ceann Comhairle  Thank you. \n Deputy Paul Lawless  -----in Britain to ensure we can retain our Catholic schools in the North? Schools can be an inclusive----- \n An Ceann Comhairle  Thank you, Deputy. Your time is up. If you want a response----- \n Deputy Paul Lawless  -----place and a religious place. \n An Ceann Comhairle  I call the Taoiseach, who has limited time I am afraid. \n The Taoiseach  I thank all of the Deputies for raising important issues. Deputy McGreehan in the first instance correctly identified that we are delivering results in respect of the shared island unit. It is practical and impactful. It is not about rhetoric. We have had rhetoric for 60 or 70 years and longer. It is about getting things done and delivering, and that is what we are doing. I take the point the Deputy made in respect of Dundalk IT and Queen's University. That is a very exciting development. It is a huge opportunity. Both institutions have to work now, as Deputy Ó Murchú said, to get the heads of agreement worked out and proper understanding for the benefit of students and staff. Deputy McGreehan has been a strong advocate of this. Deputy Ó Murchú has raised it as well. I have made it clear to the Minister, Deputy James Lawless, that I am supportive. I have no doubt that if the shared island unit gets a concrete proposal, it can respond positively. Obviously there is a lot more detailed work to be done. We need to do this properly, which is why the fund goes out to 2035. We do not need to rush things. We need to get them done properly and effectively so it is informed.  Deputy Devlin used the phrase \"practical people-focused projects\". This sums it up. No other Government since the foundation of the State has invested in Northern Ireland like this Government has. The shared island unit is a unique departure. It speaks far more than a lot of the rhetoric. I have been reading a lot about the 1940s, the 1950s and the 1960s. Some pretty good histories have been published recently on partition. Some good work has been done on all of this. Throughout the decades people spoke about four green fields, unity and all the rest of it but very little happened. We have come through 30 years of horrific violence, which was unnecessary in my view. We have an opportunity now. People are entitled to their constitutional positions. There is no issue there. There is nothing stopping any political party, by the way, from advancing a detailed blueprint. I have yet to see one. There is nothing stopping any political party doing this but we can come back to it on another day. \n Deputy Peadar Tóibín  The Government is the best place to do it. \n The Taoiseach  These questions are on the shared island unit so I will keep it there.  Deputy Devlin raised Dundalk IT and Queen's University and I have explained this. With regard to Dublin and Belfast and the night-time economies, we are very anxious to really develop the Dublin-Belfast economic corridor. The councils are good. I get the point on the night-time economies. I will look at it in terms of what we can do.  To respond to Deputy Paul Murphy, COP is a bit outside the shared island unit but he got it in. When he speaks about \"the big dairy farmers\" - he is classic at this - he is pretending that medium-sized and small dairy farmers would be okay under him. What he is saying would wipe out dairy farming entirely. This is what he is saying and he should be honest about it. The Government has made its position clear on this.  I agree 100% with Deputy Michael Murphy that we need evidence-based, informed and objective research and data. The shared island unit has a separate strand for big funding where we commission the ESRI to do major research. It did one on school completion North and South. The North was higher. We now have an initiative under the shared island unit on healthcare. \n An Ceann Comhairle  Thank you, Taoiseach. \n The Taoiseach  It has done economic studies as well as studies on primary care and health. Very good studies are being done by the ESRI and there will be more. More data will be coming next month. Research is also being done by the National Economic and Social Council.  To respond to Deputy Quaide, we are doing work in the area he mentioned but there is potential for more work if we can get a viable project. He is correct that attacks have increased. People are living in fear and this is a big concern.  To respond to Deputy Shane Moynihan, work has been done under the shared island unit in terms of enterprise centres and on SMEs. Deputy Moynihan can look at InterTradeIreland's project under the shared island unit, which I launched recently. Tremendous work has been done joining companies North and South together using shared island unit funding.  To respond to Deputy Conway-Walsh, there is commissioned research from the ESRI on economics. The shared island unit is outside of the constitutional issue and will remain so to try to get buy-in from all communities without prejudice. This is one of the reasons it has buy-in across the board from all communities and traditions. \n Deputy Rose Conway-Walsh  I am trying to avoid reinventing the wheel. \n The Taoiseach  Yes, but we do not want to undermine and kill what is a good initiative. \n Deputy Rose Conway-Walsh  It is not----- \n An Ceann Comhairle  We are out of time. \n The Taoiseach  Deputy Boyd Barrett raised what is a separate issue really.

That concludes Questions to the Taoiseach. \n The Taoiseach  I will come back to Deputy Boyd Barrett another day on that. ",

As such, it's important to make clear that neither the Government nor Sport Ireland has a role in determining who can participate in international competitions organised by international sporting federations. International sporting federations are responsible for determining the composition of their membership in line with their own internal rules. The international federations have a leadership role for their global games and it is at this level that strategic decisions should be taken rather than by individual countries’ NGBs.  On a wider note, given that the detailed supplied relate to a fixture with Israel, I can say that Ireland welcomes the agreement on the first phase of the 20-point plan to end the war in Gaza. The first phase of the plan, the ceasefire and hostage release agreement, is an important step on a road to peace. Our immediate focus must be on ensuring humanitarian aid into and throughout Gaza at scale. Ireland stands ready to play our part in working towards a sustainable peace between Israel and Palestine through the implementation of the two-State solution.  Regarding the topic of athlete safety and welfare raised by the deputy, Sport Ireland works with National Governing Bodies of Sport (NGBs) to ensure that appropriate policies are put in place to take a proactive approach to safeguarding by identifying and mitigating risks to athlete welfare. It also works with NGBs to ensure mechanisms are in place to appropriately deal with matters that may arise. ",

This report concluded that COVID-19 does not satisfy the statutory criteria for recognition as an occupational illness or accident at work. Specifically, it found that presumptions about workplace transmission would not be sustainable as it is not possible to establish with confidence that the disease has been contracted through a person’s occupation and not through community transmission. This is because data shows that community transmission was the primary means of transmission.  However, my Department's range of income supports, including illness benefit and invalidity pension, at the same or higher rates of payment as occupational injuries benefit, are available to people who cannot work due to the effects of long COVID.  With specific reference to employees in the health services the report found that the Temporary Scheme of Paid Leave for Public Health Service Employees was the appropriate channel through which a targeted sectoral support should be considered. This Temporary Scheme is a matter for my colleague, the Minister for Public Expenditure, Infrastructure, Public Service Reform and Digitalisation. The scheme has been extended a number of times, most recently to conclude on 31 December 2025. Any employee remaining unwell after that date may utilise the full provisions of the Public Service Sick Leave Scheme which will provide further support.

From a policy perspective, I met with members of the disability sector on 29 September 2025 for a constructive dialogue around our shared ambition to ensure 100% transport accessibility in Ireland. The Government launched the National Human Rights Strategy for Disabled People on 3rd September 2025. In line with the United Nation Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, the strategy puts great importance on engagement with disabled people. Pillar 5 of the strategy, 'Transport and Mobility' contains a number of transport priority actions. I really welcomed the opportunity to hear views on transport accessibility and the new strategy’s actions. It was a valuable and rewarding exchange with Disabled Person Organisations, service providers, Disability User Groups, and board representatives from transport operators.  Under the Dublin Transport Authority Act 2008, the National Transport Authority (NTA) has statutory responsibility for promoting the development of integrated, accessible public transport networks and infrastructure. The NTA works with the relevant public transport operators, for example Irish Rail, who have responsibility for day to day operational issues, to progressively make public transport more accessible.  In May of this year, Irish Rail reduced the advance notice needed to 1 hour at 15 of the main stations where the majority of its requests would come from. The stations cover almost every terminus station on the network, as well as key interchange points such as Limerick Junction, Mallow and Athlone.  In light of the Irish Rails responsibilities for rail services, including advance bookings, I have referred your question to the the company for direct reply to you.

        "answerText": " Minister for Finance (Deputy Paschal Donohoe)  The Government decided upon the introduction of the Local Property Tax (LPT), that a liability to the tax should apply to all owners of residential properties with a limited number of exemptions and no deductions. Limiting the exemptions and deductions available allows the rate to be kept low for those liable persons who do not qualify for an exemption.  Local authorities put the proceeds of the LPT towards infrastructure and services in their areas, such as the maintenance and provision of public roads, footpaths, lighting, open spaces, surface water drainage and other public amenities. All property owners benefit from this expenditure in their locality, regardless of whether they are obliged to pay management fees or not.  There is no exemption from, or reduction in, LPT for those paying management or apartment fees under the Finance (Local Property Tax) Act 2012 as amended. When a person pays a management fee, they receive services such as bin collection, maintenance of common areas and a sinking fund for repairs. These are costs that property owners or occupiers who do not pay management fees must meet from their own means.  The 2019 LPT Inter-Departmental Review Group looked at this matter but did not recommend that persons paying management fees be afforded relief in respect of LPT. Moreover, the review did not consider that there was a case for deductibility of such management fees against LPT.  A requirement to pay a management fee or service charge to property management companies is not relevant in determining whether a property is subject to the LPT. Accordingly, whilst those who are liable for these payments may be exempt from LPT for another reason, or may be entitled to avail of a deferral arrangement under the provisions contained in the legislation, there is no specific exemption for the payment of management fees, nor is there provision to offset the amount paid on management fees against LPT. I have no plans to change this. ",

In Budget 2026, I provided for a €1.15 billion package of new social protection measures.  Government has been very clear that there would be no once-off measures in this year’s Budget.  We are at the start of a five-year programme for Government and not everything can be done in year one.  However, the Budget package contained significant targeted measures to support disabled people.  These measures include:  • A €10 increase in the weekly rates of payment, bringing the personal rates of payment to €254 per week from January.  • A Christmas bonus double payment to all persons getting a long-term disability payment, to be paid in December 2025.  • A €20 increase in the rate of Domiciliary Care Allowance bringing the rate to €380 per month.  • A €5 increase in the Fuel Allowance, bring it to €38 per week from January 2026.  • People moving from Disability Allowance or Blind Pension to take up work will be able to retain their Fuel Allowance payment for five years.  The Back to Work Family Dividend is also being extended to this group, where they have children.  • From January, extending the Wage Subsidy Scheme to people who acquire a disability while in employment and increasing the rates paid from April.  • Increase the Earnings Disregard for Carer’s Allowance by €375 to €1,000 for a single person and by €750 to €2,000 for a couple from July 2026.  The income limit for Carer’s Benefit will also increase by €375 to €1,000 per week from July 2026.  Overall, across Disability Allowance, Invalidity Pension, Blind Pension and Domiciliary Care Allowance, over €250 million in additional funding has been made available when comparing the Revised Estimates for these schemes between 2025 and 2026.  In addition, the recently published National Human Rights Strategy for Disabled People 2025-2030 takes a whole-of-Government approach and includes a commitment to establish a Strategic Focus Network on the Cost of Disability, led by my Department.  My officials have already held meetings with a number of organisations to discuss the possible structure and content of the Strategic Focus Network on the Cost of Disability.  I will be meeting a number of organisations at the next meeting of my Department’s Disability Consultative Forum on 2 December at which the Cost of Disability Strategic Focus Network is the main agenda item.

The Programme for Government commits to introducing a permanent Annual Cost of Disability Support Payment with a view to incrementally increasing this payment.  In addition, under the recently published National Human Rights Strategy for Disabled People 2025-2030 my Department will lead a Strategic Focus Network on the Cost of Disability.  The First Programme Plan of Actions 2025 - 2026 will be published shortly.  My officials have already held meetings with a number of organisations to discuss the possible structure and content of the Strategic Focus Network on the Cost of Disability.  I will be meeting a number of organisations at the next meeting of my Department’s Disability Consultative Forum on 2 December at which the Cost of Disability Strategic Focus Network is the main agenda item.  My Department provides the Supplementary Welfare Allowance scheme, for those whose means are insufficient to meet their needs and those of their dependents.  Under the scheme, the Department may make an ‘additional needs payment’ to meet essential expenditure which a person could not reasonably be expected to meet out of their weekly income.  Any person who considers they may have an entitlement to an additional needs payment is encouraged to contact their local community welfare service.  I trust this clarifies the issue for the Deputy. ",

        "answerText": " Minister for Social Protection  The Government recognises the significant additional costs that disabled people can face in their daily lives and is committed improving outcomes for disabled people by introducing permanent measures.  In Budget 2026, I provided for a €1.15 billion package of new social protection measures.  This included a general rate increase of €10 across social welfare schemes from January 2026, with proportionate increases for those on reduced rates and Qualified Adults.  This will bring the maximum personal rate of Disability Allowance to €254 per week from January 2026, a 4.1% increase when consumer prices have increased by 2.7% over the 12 months to September 2025, according to data from the Central Statistics Office.  In Budget 2026 we also provided for the highest ever increases in the Child Support Payment – an increase of €16 to €78 for children aged 12 or over, and of €8 to €58 for children under 12.  In addition, the rate of Fuel Allowance will increase by €5 from €33 to €38 per week from January 2026.  This will provide an additional €140 during the annual fuel allowance season which will help to offset the impact of increasing energy costs.  Budget 2026 also contained other significant targeted measures to support disabled people.  These measures include:  • A Christmas bonus double payment to all persons getting a long-term disability payment, to be paid in December 2025.  • People moving from Disability Allowance or Blind Pension to take up work will be able to retain their Fuel Allowance payment for five years.  • People getting Disability Allowance or Blind Pension who have children will be eligible for Back to Work Family Dividend when taking up employment and moving off those payments.  • Expansion of the Wage Subsidy Scheme to people who acquire a disability while in employment and to those who transfer from Invalidity Pension to Partial Capacity Benefit, and increasing the rates paid from April.  • The Government allocated €3.8 billion to the Department of Children, Disability and Equality for disability services in 2026, including funding for Community Based Specialist Disability Services to ensure people with disabilities receive the right support, at the right time, in the right place.  This represents a 20% increase year on year and represents an overall increase since 2020 of €1.8 billion.  The Department of Social Protection package also contained measures aimed at supporting carers, and recipients of Domiciliary Care Allowance.  • Increase the Earnings Disregard for Carer’s Allowance by €375 to €1,000 for a single person and by €750 to €2,000 for a couple from July 2026.  • The income limit for Carer’s Benefit will increase by €375 to €1,000 per week from July 2026.  • €20 increase in the monthly Domiciliary Care Allowance payment bringing the payment to €380 per month from January.  These measures build on the progress made in recent years. Over the last five budgets the weekly payment rates for disability and carer's payments have increased by €51.  The earnings disregard for Disability Allowance and Blind Pension has increased by almost 38% since Budget 2021 from €120 to €165 currently.  A person availing for the Disability Allowance earnings disregard can earn up to €517.60 a week and still keep their entitlement to the minimum rate of payment and their secondary benefits.  My Department will publish a social impact assessment of Budget 2026, with distributional analysis of the measures in this Budget.  I trust this clarifies the matter for the Deputy. ",

Under the Roads Acts 1993-2015, the operation and management of individual national roads is a matter for Transport Infrastructure Ireland (TII), in conjunction with the local authorities concerned.  Therefore, matters relating to the day to day operations regarding national roads, including toll roads are within the remit of TII. More specifically, the statutory power to levy tolls, to make toll bye-laws and to enter into agreements with private investors are vested in TII under Part V of the Roads Act 1993 (as amended). Moreover, the contracts for the privately-operated toll schemes are commercial agreements between TII and the Public Private Partnership (PPP) concessionaires concerned.  With regard to the toll on the M50, it is important to point out that revenues generated by this toll are invested by TII in the operation and maintenance of both the M50 and the wider national road network.  Noting the above position, I have referred the question regarding changes to the tolls on the M50 to TII for a direct reply.

My department and the National Council for Special Education (NCSE) have begun preparatory work in relation to planning for the provision of further new special class and special school places for the 2026/27 school year and beyond.  As you are aware parents were asked to notify the NCSE of their requirement for a special class for the 2026/27 school year by 1 October 2025. The NCSE is now collating and assessing the information gathered through this notification process. Once complete the NCSE will be in a position to engage with schools across the country to open new special classes.  In order to ensure new special classes can open as quickly as possible the NCSE prioritise working with medium and larger primary schools who do not already have a special class and have available accommodation to accommodate new special class. This approach maximises the use of existing space which can be reconfigured efficiently while also ensuring that new provision continues to be established. It also increases number of schools with special classes providing parents with greater choice and reducing the distances that some children are travelling to access a special class place.  However, as in other years where schools have no available accommodation, particularly at post-primary level and there is known demand in a local area, my department will continue to provide additional classroom accommodation to provide necessary places.  The NCSE will also have due regard to any vacant places in existing special classes in an area and any places that will be become available through the normal movement of children leaving primary or post-primary school.  The school referred to by the Deputy already has 3 special classes and any school willing to open further new special classes is to be commended.  The NCSE will assess what additional provision is required in local areas and what schools have capacity to accommodate required provision. My department and the NCSE are committed to ensuring that sufficient special education placements remain available for children with special educational needs and will continue to review and monitor the situation as to where new specialist provision is required.

        "answerText": " Minister for Health  Under the Hormone Replacement Therapy (HRT) measure, which came into effect on 1 June 2025, where a woman has been prescribed HRT by her healthcare provider for the purpose of alleviating the symptoms associated with all stages of menopause, the cost of the HRT medications or products, and the pharmacy dispensing fees will be met by the State.  This measure is intended to support the management of the symptoms of menopause and, therefore, relates to the provision of treatment for the symptoms a specific medical condition/life stage i.e. menopause. HRT is the most commonly used treatment for managing symptoms of menopause and has shown to be the most effective intervention.  Menopause has been highlighted as a key priority area by the Women’s Health Taskforce. It is a key action in the Women’s Health Action Plans. Several measures have been implemented in recent years to improve the experience of menopause for women in Ireland, including this HRT arrangement.  I am aware that HRT is used in the treatment of other medical conditions/circumstances, including gender-affirming healthcare, hypogonadism, IVF, and some cancer treatments. However, the current provision of the Free HRT Arrangement, legislated for under the Health Insurance (Amendment) and Health (Provision of Menopause Products) Act 2024, limits eligibility to those whose healthcare provider has prescribed HRT to alleviate the symptoms of menopause. The legislation does not make amendments to what must be included in a prescription for it to be considered valid.  Currently, prescriptions written by Irish registered prescribers practicing in Ireland are valid whether presented in paper format or received through Healthmail.  Healthmail is a secure clinical email service that allows health care providers to send and receive clinical patient information in a secure manner. The service is provided by the Primary Care Directorate of the HSE and is managed by eHealth Ireland and supported by the Irish College of General Practitioners and the Irish Pharmacy Union. ",

        "answerText": " An Leas-Cheann Comhairle  I remind Members that we are due to conclude at 4.18 p.m. \n The Taoiseach  I propose to take questions Nos. 18 to 36, inclusive, together.  The Cabinet committee on disability has been established to oversee the implementation of the programme for Government commitments in the area of disability, with specific focus on children's disability services as well as disability more generally under the Government's new National Human Rights Strategy for Disabled People 2025-2030.  Under the programme for Government, we are committed to delivering a step change in disability services and to advancing the rights and improving the lives of people with disabilities. To deliver on this, I established the stand-alone Cabinet committee on disability. This committee has met five times to date, most recently on 16 October, and it is due to meet again on 27 November. To date, the committee has considered issues including the new national disability strategy, the provision of therapists in special schools, improving the delivery of services and reform of the assessment of need process.  Despite the committed efforts of so many working to provide services and significant increases in funding and resources in recent years, I acknowledge that we can and must do more and do better. I am determined that this will be a Government that moves forward with purpose in improving the level, scale and quality of support for disabled people and their families.  The Government's new National Human Rights Strategy for Disabled People 2025-2030, published in September, is the framework for our whole-of-government approach to addressing disability and advancing the implementation of the United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities. It represents our commitment and ambition that all disabled people in Ireland can live the life of their choosing and participate in their communities and our society to the fullest extent possible.  In budget 2026, we took initial steps to deliver on this commitment through record allocations for disabilities services and special education. Reflecting the importance of disability issues, I have established a dedicated disability unit in my Department.  An initial programme planned for the unit has been published, outlining how the unit will work to achieve this. The unit is already up and running, supporting the work of the Cabinet committee on disability and ensuring a truly all-of-government approach to disability. \n Deputy Aisling Dempsey  I want to raise the urgent issue of the transition from child disability services to adult disability services. A constituent has told me that her child was not seen by child disability services until he was almost 18 and that was eight years post her first contact. The family had no clarity on what supports they were entitled to when he was a child, let alone what they were facing into from adult disability services. Another constituent - another mother - has told me some therapies her child receives now are not going to be available in adult disability services. Somehow, her adult child will not have the same needs any more. In this case, respite will also be withdrawn when her child ages out of child disability services. This is leaving families feeling anxious, unsupported and fearful for their family's future. Will the Taoiseach and the committee urgently examine the transition process between child and adult disability services to ensure continuity of care and no loss of essential supports for young people and their families? \n Deputy Catherine Ardagh  One of the greatest fears facing parents of children with disabilities and parents of adult children with disabilities is what will happen when we are no longer here. Who will care for my son? Who will care for all of these children, including adult children? It is a question that causes sleepless nights for so many people. Ultimately, we need a clear, compassionate pathway for lifelong housing and care in the community for adults with disabilities, so families can have certainty and peace of mind.  Will the Government commit to developing a national plan to ensure that every person with a disability has a safe, permanent home and the supports they need, not just for today but for the future? All of us have been in many houses in our constituencies and we have met elderly parents caring for middle-aged children with disabilities. It is heartbreaking that they are in their senior years and they do not know what is going to happen to their son or daughter when they pass. We have all dealt with these types of queries. It is something that lies ahead for me and my family also. We need to start discussing housing and care in the community for people with disabilities. \n Deputy Martin Daly  I am following on from what my colleague Deputies have already said about the care of the offspring of people who are getting older and have no certainty around what is going to happen when they are not here any more. It is a major challenge within the community. It seems like a cliff edge. When you die, you get a residency. That is not good enough. There has got to be planning around that, and it should be seamless.  A lot of work has been done on the provision of special education classes, and special school place provision. We have done stuff around increasing the income disregard for the carer's allowance and we are getting to an abolishment of the means test but also I think we need to address flexible arrangements around getting more people who live with disability into work and out of poverty without losing their benefits. The cost of disability payment should be considered also. There is a lot of work to be done. The direction is right but we do need a huge focus on it. \n Deputy Peadar Tóibín  It is 420 days since I asked the Tánaiste, Deputy Simon Harris, about why Harvey Morrison Sherratt was taken off the waiting list. The Tánaiste has not been able to answer that question in those 420 days. That is an incredible indictment in relation to it. He said in the Dáil that he would immediately ask the HSE and that he would ask the Minister for Health, yet no question has been answered.  We saw in The Sunday Times this weekend that a protected disclosure was submitted to the Department of Health. The information in this protected disclosure is catastrophic. The implication is that someone, or a group, took a decision that was not medically based and may have led to the death of Harvey. That is a catastrophic question. The import of that on a government is absolutely enormous. What the Government is asking us to believe is that on one level, the Tánaiste has spent 420 days asking questions in relation to why Harvey was taken off the waiting list and he still did not get an answer and, at the same time, a protected disclosure was given to the Department of Health with the answer. That is an incredible thing.  Does the Government understand the import of what has just happened? Why has it taken 420 days for the Tánaiste to answer a question? Have the staff or the management involved actually been asked what has happened? \n An Leas-Cheann Comhairle  I thank the Deputy. \n Deputy Peadar Tóibín  Are they refusing to answer what has happened? Why is it that the family only found out through The Sunday Times what happened in relation to their child? \n An Leas-Cheann Comhairle  I am sorry that I overlooked Deputy Coppinger. \n Deputy Ruth Coppinger  That is no problem.  Governments have fallen over less than what has happened in relation to Harvey Morrison Sherratt. We found out over the weekend through a protected disclosure that a worker heard or became aware that Harvey had been taken off the waiting list because he was mistakenly, or for whatever reason, considered \"palliative\" - in itself a horrible phrase. First, his parents were not told and, second, no care plan or treatment plan was drawn up if he was \"palliative\". This just defies belief. Aside from the fact that he may have ended up dying because of this error, perhaps if he had received the surgery, he would not be dead. The fact is that we have surgeons who would not tell parents about this and who would not organise a care plan for a \"palliative\" child. Every week, we come in here and ask the Taoiseach to have a statutory public inquiry. The Government's stance has been to have a scoping inquiry here and a scoping inquiry there. We need a full statutory inquiry into all of the issues surrounding Harvey, CHI and spinal surgery. The Taoiseach should have asked questions since this broke on Sunday, given how important this issue is in Ireland for so many people. \n An Leas-Cheann Comhairle  I thank the Deputy. \n Deputy Ruth Coppinger  He should have asked CHI directly about this particular issue, so I hope he has answers for us today. \n Deputy Mark Ward  I was at a public meeting last Monday in Neilstown hosted by parents of children with disabilities. They raised a multitude of areas and how their children are being failed. There are long waiting lists for assessment of need, speech and language therapy and occupational therapy. There is no access to appropriate school places. There are limited SNA allocations. They also talked about not even getting appropriate places for school transport and arbitrary timeframes for filling out forms. If they do not fill out the forms within the timeframe, there are consequences for their children.  I got a response this morning saying the average wait time for an assessment of need in my area of Dublin Mid-West is three and a half years, even though the statutory timeframe is six months. Children are being denied the right to reach their full potential. How is the Government going to address the failures children are experiencing? \n Deputy Paul Murphy  The budget reneged on a key commitment in the programme for Government to introduce a permanent annual cost of disability support payment and then to incrementally increase it. We know that it costs a lot of money to be disabled in this country. A few years ago, the Department of Finance estimated it at around €10,000. It has obviously gone up substantially since then. Last year's €400 lump sum disability payment was a drop in the ocean but far from increasing it, as promised, the Government abolished it completely. It slashed other payments that disabled people rely on, like the living alone allowance lump sum and the electricity credit. Even taking into account small increases to the disability allowance, the Government still took well over €1,000 out of the pockets of disabled people. It is shocking in one of the richest countries in the world, with a budget surplus and with the cost-of-living crisis ongoing, that the Government made disabled people poor. That is not just in real inflationary terms but even in nominal terms. \n An Leas-Cheann Comhairle  I thank the Deputy. \n Deputy Paul Murphy  The Government made them poorer, and took over €1,000 from them. Will it recognise this as a major mistake? Will it bring back an emergency lump sum cost-of-living payment for disabled people before Christmas? \n Deputy Ruairí Ó Murchú  I want to bring up the attempt by Darver National School in County Louth to have two autism classes sanctioned. The initial engagement between the principal, the SENO and the NCSE took place in June 2025. This was followed up throughout September and October, with no word back. It is absolutely supported by the patrons and the board of management and all have tried to make contact. We need to ensure that this happens but we also need to ensure that the school is contacted.  I do not think this is okay. I am just giving the timeframe on this.  I also need someone to light a fire under the Department of education in relation to Ardee Educate Together National School. Louth County Council is the agent but the Department ----- \n An Leas-Cheann Comhairle  Thank you Deputy. \n Deputy Ruairí Ó Murchú  This relates to parking spaces and planning. It should be a very small piece of work to get this changed to account for the 45 staff and also enough bays for the minibuses. At this point, there is not space. It would be very cheap to get it changed at this point. A contractor is on for this. If not at this point, then we could be talking about something that could cost €100,000-plus. \n Deputy Barry Heneghan  Is there an update or timeline from the Cabinet committee on disability on assessments of need?  In my own constituency, Stapolin Educate Together primary school is looking for two additional autism classes. It has a very powerful image of 12 chairs outside that school representing children locked out. I would urge the Taoiseach push----- \n The Taoiseach  Which school? \n Deputy Barry Heneghan  Stapolin in Dublin Bay North. I can send details to the Taoiseach’s office. These children are locked out. I urge that the NCSE look at this school. It has brilliant staff who are really hard working.  Gabhaim míle buíochas leis an Aire, Deputy McEntee, i dtaobh Ghaelcholáiste Reachrann. Tá sé iontach go bhfuil rudaí ag bogadh ar aghaidh air sin. \n Deputy Conor D. McGuinness  The Government is failing children in Waterford with additional needs over the stagnation in early intervention classes. Five years ago, there were two early intervention classes across Waterford city and county. This year, there are still two. That is despite an increasing need and a demand that is there but unmet. These early interventions are critical for children’s educational and social outcomes. It is something that the Taoiseach’s Government needs to grapple with. Over the last nine or ten months, we have seen issues around special education spaces and classes in schools. While the Government did belatedly do some work to fill some of those gaps in service provision, there is a lot more to do. That situation is still there and I think there will be problems next year. We need to get to grips with the early intervention classes and increase them dramatically so that there is availability for parents to get their children that much-needed timely intervention. \n Deputy Liam Quaide  The plight of ageing parents of adult children with intellectual disabilities is an area of abject neglect on the part of the Government. Many of these parents are being deprived of peace of mind in their later years because they remain the primary carers of their children. They are less physically able to carry out this role as time goes on. They are living with a constant background worry of not knowing where their children will live after they die and how their need for belonging and community will be met.  The Government’s privatisation of services means that both young people and adults who require 24-hour staffed residential support are increasingly living far from home, in some cases hundreds of kilometres away, not connected to wrap-around services, detached from their communities and families. What is the Taoiseach’s plan to address this particular crisis in residential services for people with intellectual disabilities? Why are these services being privatised and fragmented to such an extent when the outcomes in many cases are so poor for our disabled citizens and when the cost to the State is so enormous? \n Deputy Rose Conway-Walsh  It is an absolute disgrace that even today we still do not know which children were wrongly removed from the scoliosis waiting list or why it happened. Families have been left in the dark while children suffer in pain. There is a clear culture of secrecy, concealment and unaccountability at the heart of children’s healthcare and an utter lack of transparency. I want to talk to the Taoiseach again, after many other times I have done so, about Mikey Henry Benson from Mayo, who is still waiting for the procedures he needs. I want to ask the Taoiseach to ask the Minister for Health when she is in Mayo on Monday to meet the family of Mikey Henry Benson to go through the episodes and the pain they have gone through and to find a way forward so that we can ensure that Mikey Henry Benson stays alive? \n Deputy Cian O'Callaghan  The Government has said time and again that there should be an appropriate school place for every child. I am contacted constantly by parents who are desperately trying to get a place for their child in an autism class. The same as any other parent, they just want their child to be able to thrive. Stapolin Educate Together National School in Baldoyle has asked to open two additional new autism classes. The school has the space for the modular units required. It also has experienced staff who can support the opening of these two additional classes. All that is required is for approval to be granted. Is the Minister for education going to meet the school principal about this and when is approval going be granted for these two much-needed classes? \n Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett  While I was getting my treatment in St. Luke's, I met a very nice woman called Shirley who brought up her daughter Lauren's case with me. Lauren subsequently wrote to me. Lauren lives with her and has a life-long disability condition that means she is unfit for work. She had previously been on domiciliary care allowance, then on disability allowance, but she then got married. She lives at home with her mum still, being cared for by her mum, but because she got married and went over the threshold, her disability payment has been cut. It really highlights the massive problem and injustice of having means testing of disability payments. What does the Taoiseach have to say to Lauren and many others like her who lose all support for their disability on the basis that their partner’s income has gone over a very arbitrary threshold? \n An Leas-Cheann Comhairle  We are gone way over time, so I would ask the Taoiseach to consider that. \n The Taoiseach  We are about seven minutes over time, is it? \n An Leas-Cheann Comhairle  Yes. \n The Taoiseach  I will try to do what I can as quickly as I can. \n An Leas-Cheann Comhairle  No, you are okay. Just ----- \n The Taoiseach  No, I am conscious of others.  Deputy Dempsey raised the issue of transition from child services to adult services and that there was an absence of early planning for that. She also made the comment that parents were told that therapies would not be available in transition. That is not acceptable and respite should not be withdrawn. In the disability unit that I have established, a key workstream will be planning and designing for the future. There should be proper data and proper early analysis of expected need for services from primary to post-primary, from post-primary to adult or, indeed, continuing education or other aspects. That is where I want to get to and that is where we want to get to as a Government because there is no doubt - Deputy Ardagh has raised this as well, as have others - that the insecurity is shocking. It is very sad that so many parents – I have met them – have no certainty. Deputy Daly said it was a cliff edge, and it is for many. If one talks to some of the providers in the sections 38 and 39 organisations, they are all dealing with emergency cases. That is not satisfactory, so we have got to get a more planned approach to this transition. I think there are also issues in terms of the interaction between the sections 38 and 39 organisations and the Government and Government services and how that works. Many of those are under pressure as well, I have to acknowledge, but equally we have to work out the models and so forth. There should be proper databases outlining how many people are in a given service at a given time and what will the requirements be at a later date. There is that issue of creating a secure transition and that older parents in particular, senior citizens now, have a certain sense of security and knowledge well in advance that their children will be looked after in case anything happens to themselves. That is a very understandable human concern, which is not being met at the moment but that needs to be met. I am very determined that we would put services in place to enable that to happen. There is a fear there, as Deputy Ardagh said. She called for a national plan for this and that is something I am going to work on so that people will have that security. Other Deputies have raised that issue. We should be looking at a seamless transition, ideally.  There is a link into housing as well in that respect, different solutions at different times in the journey of life that people can move to better accommodation, more suitable accommodation. We should have greater flexibility around that provision. There can be too many silos between different Government Departments in respect of that but we are working on it. That is what the Cabinet subcommittee is for, to do a cross-government, whole-of-government approach.  Deputy Daly and others raised the income disregard and the cost of disability. The cost of disability will be looked at in the next budget and there is a working group established in relation to that. On the relationship between work and disability payments, there are some supports there for transitioning from disability, from the social protection system, into work in terms of the medical card and others. I think that can be strengthened and that those moving into work can be given greater certainty, more long-term certainty, that they will retain their benefits or whatever entitlements they have as they go into work. There have been improvements on the employer grant and so on but there is further work to be done in terms of giving greater security around that transition and encouraging people to go into work without fear of losing their health entitlements or the various other entitlements they have.  Earlier during Leaders' Questions, we dealt with questions in respect of Harvey Morrison Sherratt. I would say to the Deputy the Minister is this afternoon meeting with the parents. The Minister did look for a chronology from the HSE. The Minister has that. The CEO of the HSE shared that with the family. It is a draft because the HSE wanted the family's input into that. I dealt with the protected disclosure earlier on Leaders' Questions. The Minister did not see that. All protected disclosures do not go to the Ministers per se . The Minister has an obligation to establish a system by which it goes to the protected disclosure commissioner. That commissioner has the specific protected disclosure and is now going to deal with that. Without question, there is a meeting on between the Minister, the Tánaiste and the parents of Harvey, with a view to an inquiry. The precise format is to be determined.  Deputy Coppinger had a similar question in relation to this. It is a fundamental question as to why Harvey was taken off a waiting list. There are clinical decisions clearly involved here that have to be examined and will be examined. Likewise, there are other, broader investigations and examinations of issues pertaining to CHI, as the Deputy knows. Some of them have come in and some have not. Overall, again, terms of reference have to be specific here. We can have statutory inquiries that can go on too long and do not give closure to families. I think there is a bit of work to be done yet and the Minister is meeting with the family in that regard.  Deputy Murphy raised the issue of the cost of disability programme. I dealt with that earlier insofar as the next budget will be dealing with that. Once-off payments were two years. What we were determined to do in this budget was to increase the permanent payments within the social protection system, which we did, for example, and to enhance them as well and also, in terms of the carer's allowance threshold and income disregard, to increase that and we will eliminate that over the lifetime of this Government. We increased the domiciliary care allowance significantly.  In terms of education, there are now about 46,500 teachers and SNAs working in our education system, committed to supporting and nurturing children with special educational needs. Huge numbers of special needs assistants have been appointed over the past number of years. There are about 400 new special classes in the budget of 2025, and about 2,700 new places for the 2025-2026 school year. Some of those school places are under construction and being put in place. A number of specifics have been asked. I will check those out with the Minister. I am not in a position to have knowledge of every single application from individual schools in respect of autism classes and so forth but I will follow those up with the Minister. I presume the Deputies are also engaging with the Departments in respect of that.  On the assessment of need, the Cabinet subcommittee on disability did approve outline proposals for a change in legislation which will have to happen to prioritise the provision of services. Therapy services to children has been the number one priority in terms of the legislative objective of that. The access and inclusion model, AIM, is a critical intervention for early years in terms of disability, in response to Deputy McGuinness's question. I would make that point and that has been enhanced and improved and will be improved as a result of the recent budget. Deputies Quaide, Dempsey and Ardagh raised the issue of insecurity and worry for ageing parents of children with disabilities. I am very conscious of that and we will work to see if we can improve on that.  I have dealt with the issue raised by Deputy Conway-Walsh. I response to Deputy Cian O'Callaghan, I will check in respect of the school in Baldoyle. I do not have awareness of that. In response to Deputy Boyd Barrett, again, I do not know the specific issue but I think it is an income threshold issue in terms of people marrying. \n Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett  It is, yes, the means test. \n The Taoiseach  I will have that examined. That is something that we can certainly look at. I will talk to the Minister for Social Protection in relation to that. \n Deputy Rose Conway-Walsh  Sorry, I think the Taoiseach was referring to the previous question. It was the one on Mikey Henry-Benson I had asked. \n The Taoiseach  Sorry. Again, I will talk to the Minister in respect of it. To be fair, this should be done at hospital level. It should be done properly through the clinicians properly engaging with the family and with the parents. There are liaison officers in CHI as well who should be----- \n Deputy Rose Conway-Walsh  I know it should but it was not and it is not. \n The Taoiseach  I will make the Minister aware of the case. \n Deputy Rose Conway-Walsh  Thank you. \n Deputy Ruairí Ó Murchú  On the two issues, if I could write to the Taoiseach and if his good offices would be able to put some pressure on----- \n The Taoiseach  There are about ten projects now that you have all mentioned. I am good but----- \n Deputy Ruairí Ó Murchú  In fairness these are critical time-wise. ",

        "answerText": " An Leas-Cheann Comhairle  I remind Members that we are due to conclude at 4.18 p.m. \n The Taoiseach  I propose to take questions Nos. 18 to 36, inclusive, together.  The Cabinet committee on disability has been established to oversee the implementation of the programme for Government commitments in the area of disability, with specific focus on children's disability services as well as disability more generally under the Government's new National Human Rights Strategy for Disabled People 2025-2030.  Under the programme for Government, we are committed to delivering a step change in disability services and to advancing the rights and improving the lives of people with disabilities. To deliver on this, I established the stand-alone Cabinet committee on disability. This committee has met five times to date, most recently on 16 October, and it is due to meet again on 27 November. To date, the committee has considered issues including the new national disability strategy, the provision of therapists in special schools, improving the delivery of services and reform of the assessment of need process.  Despite the committed efforts of so many working to provide services and significant increases in funding and resources in recent years, I acknowledge that we can and must do more and do better. I am determined that this will be a Government that moves forward with purpose in improving the level, scale and quality of support for disabled people and their families.  The Government's new National Human Rights Strategy for Disabled People 2025-2030, published in September, is the framework for our whole-of-government approach to addressing disability and advancing the implementation of the United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities. It represents our commitment and ambition that all disabled people in Ireland can live the life of their choosing and participate in their communities and our society to the fullest extent possible.  In budget 2026, we took initial steps to deliver on this commitment through record allocations for disabilities services and special education. Reflecting the importance of disability issues, I have established a dedicated disability unit in my Department.  An initial programme planned for the unit has been published, outlining how the unit will work to achieve this. The unit is already up and running, supporting the work of the Cabinet committee on disability and ensuring a truly all-of-government approach to disability. \n Deputy Aisling Dempsey  I want to raise the urgent issue of the transition from child disability services to adult disability services. A constituent has told me that her child was not seen by child disability services until he was almost 18 and that was eight years post her first contact. The family had no clarity on what supports they were entitled to when he was a child, let alone what they were facing into from adult disability services. Another constituent - another mother - has told me some therapies her child receives now are not going to be available in adult disability services. Somehow, her adult child will not have the same needs any more. In this case, respite will also be withdrawn when her child ages out of child disability services. This is leaving families feeling anxious, unsupported and fearful for their family's future. Will the Taoiseach and the committee urgently examine the transition process between child and adult disability services to ensure continuity of care and no loss of essential supports for young people and their families? \n Deputy Catherine Ardagh  One of the greatest fears facing parents of children with disabilities and parents of adult children with disabilities is what will happen when we are no longer here. Who will care for my son? Who will care for all of these children, including adult children? It is a question that causes sleepless nights for so many people. Ultimately, we need a clear, compassionate pathway for lifelong housing and care in the community for adults with disabilities, so families can have certainty and peace of mind.  Will the Government commit to developing a national plan to ensure that every person with a disability has a safe, permanent home and the supports they need, not just for today but for the future? All of us have been in many houses in our constituencies and we have met elderly parents caring for middle-aged children with disabilities. It is heartbreaking that they are in their senior years and they do not know what is going to happen to their son or daughter when they pass. We have all dealt with these types of queries. It is something that lies ahead for me and my family also. We need to start discussing housing and care in the community for people with disabilities. \n Deputy Martin Daly  I am following on from what my colleague Deputies have already said about the care of the offspring of people who are getting older and have no certainty around what is going to happen when they are not here any more. It is a major challenge within the community. It seems like a cliff edge. When you die, you get a residency. That is not good enough. There has got to be planning around that, and it should be seamless.  A lot of work has been done on the provision of special education classes, and special school place provision. We have done stuff around increasing the income disregard for the carer's allowance and we are getting to an abolishment of the means test but also I think we need to address flexible arrangements around getting more people who live with disability into work and out of poverty without losing their benefits. The cost of disability payment should be considered also. There is a lot of work to be done. The direction is right but we do need a huge focus on it. \n Deputy Peadar Tóibín  It is 420 days since I asked the Tánaiste, Deputy Simon Harris, about why Harvey Morrison Sherratt was taken off the waiting list. The Tánaiste has not been able to answer that question in those 420 days. That is an incredible indictment in relation to it. He said in the Dáil that he would immediately ask the HSE and that he would ask the Minister for Health, yet no question has been answered.  We saw in The Sunday Times this weekend that a protected disclosure was submitted to the Department of Health. The information in this protected disclosure is catastrophic. The implication is that someone, or a group, took a decision that was not medically based and may have led to the death of Harvey. That is a catastrophic question. The import of that on a government is absolutely enormous. What the Government is asking us to believe is that on one level, the Tánaiste has spent 420 days asking questions in relation to why Harvey was taken off the waiting list and he still did not get an answer and, at the same time, a protected disclosure was given to the Department of Health with the answer. That is an incredible thing.  Does the Government understand the import of what has just happened? Why has it taken 420 days for the Tánaiste to answer a question? Have the staff or the management involved actually been asked what has happened? \n An Leas-Cheann Comhairle  I thank the Deputy. \n Deputy Peadar Tóibín  Are they refusing to answer what has happened? Why is it that the family only found out through The Sunday Times what happened in relation to their child? \n An Leas-Cheann Comhairle  I am sorry that I overlooked Deputy Coppinger. \n Deputy Ruth Coppinger  That is no problem.  Governments have fallen over less than what has happened in relation to Harvey Morrison Sherratt. We found out over the weekend through a protected disclosure that a worker heard or became aware that Harvey had been taken off the waiting list because he was mistakenly, or for whatever reason, considered \"palliative\" - in itself a horrible phrase. First, his parents were not told and, second, no care plan or treatment plan was drawn up if he was \"palliative\". This just defies belief. Aside from the fact that he may have ended up dying because of this error, perhaps if he had received the surgery, he would not be dead. The fact is that we have surgeons who would not tell parents about this and who would not organise a care plan for a \"palliative\" child. Every week, we come in here and ask the Taoiseach to have a statutory public inquiry. The Government's stance has been to have a scoping inquiry here and a scoping inquiry there. We need a full statutory inquiry into all of the issues surrounding Harvey, CHI and spinal surgery. The Taoiseach should have asked questions since this broke on Sunday, given how important this issue is in Ireland for so many people. \n An Leas-Cheann Comhairle  I thank the Deputy. \n Deputy Ruth Coppinger  He should have asked CHI directly about this particular issue, so I hope he has answers for us today. \n Deputy Mark Ward  I was at a public meeting last Monday in Neilstown hosted by parents of children with disabilities. They raised a multitude of areas and how their children are being failed. There are long waiting lists for assessment of need, speech and language therapy and occupational therapy. There is no access to appropriate school places. There are limited SNA allocations. They also talked about not even getting appropriate places for school transport and arbitrary timeframes for filling out forms. If they do not fill out the forms within the timeframe, there are consequences for their children.  I got a response this morning saying the average wait time for an assessment of need in my area of Dublin Mid-West is three and a half years, even though the statutory timeframe is six months. Children are being denied the right to reach their full potential. How is the Government going to address the failures children are experiencing? \n Deputy Paul Murphy  The budget reneged on a key commitment in the programme for Government to introduce a permanent annual cost of disability support payment and then to incrementally increase it. We know that it costs a lot of money to be disabled in this country. A few years ago, the Department of Finance estimated it at around €10,000. It has obviously gone up substantially since then. Last year's €400 lump sum disability payment was a drop in the ocean but far from increasing it, as promised, the Government abolished it completely. It slashed other payments that disabled people rely on, like the living alone allowance lump sum and the electricity credit. Even taking into account small increases to the disability allowance, the Government still took well over €1,000 out of the pockets of disabled people. It is shocking in one of the richest countries in the world, with a budget surplus and with the cost-of-living crisis ongoing, that the Government made disabled people poor. That is not just in real inflationary terms but even in nominal terms. \n An Leas-Cheann Comhairle  I thank the Deputy. \n Deputy Paul Murphy  The Government made them poorer, and took over €1,000 from them. Will it recognise this as a major mistake? Will it bring back an emergency lump sum cost-of-living payment for disabled people before Christmas? \n Deputy Ruairí Ó Murchú  I want to bring up the attempt by Darver National School in County Louth to have two autism classes sanctioned. The initial engagement between the principal, the SENO and the NCSE took place in June 2025. This was followed up throughout September and October, with no word back. It is absolutely supported by the patrons and the board of management and all have tried to make contact. We need to ensure that this happens but we also need to ensure that the school is contacted.  I do not think this is okay. I am just giving the timeframe on this.  I also need someone to light a fire under the Department of education in relation to Ardee Educate Together National School. Louth County Council is the agent but the Department ----- \n An Leas-Cheann Comhairle  Thank you Deputy. \n Deputy Ruairí Ó Murchú  This relates to parking spaces and planning. It should be a very small piece of work to get this changed to account for the 45 staff and also enough bays for the minibuses. At this point, there is not space. It would be very cheap to get it changed at this point. A contractor is on for this. If not at this point, then we could be talking about something that could cost €100,000-plus. \n Deputy Barry Heneghan  Is there an update or timeline from the Cabinet committee on disability on assessments of need?  In my own constituency, Stapolin Educate Together primary school is looking for two additional autism classes. It has a very powerful image of 12 chairs outside that school representing children locked out. I would urge the Taoiseach push----- \n The Taoiseach  Which school? \n Deputy Barry Heneghan  Stapolin in Dublin Bay North. I can send details to the Taoiseach’s office. These children are locked out. I urge that the NCSE look at this school. It has brilliant staff who are really hard working.  Gabhaim míle buíochas leis an Aire, Deputy McEntee, i dtaobh Ghaelcholáiste Reachrann. Tá sé iontach go bhfuil rudaí ag bogadh ar aghaidh air sin. \n Deputy Conor D. McGuinness  The Government is failing children in Waterford with additional needs over the stagnation in early intervention classes. Five years ago, there were two early intervention classes across Waterford city and county. This year, there are still two. That is despite an increasing need and a demand that is there but unmet. These early interventions are critical for children’s educational and social outcomes. It is something that the Taoiseach’s Government needs to grapple with. Over the last nine or ten months, we have seen issues around special education spaces and classes in schools. While the Government did belatedly do some work to fill some of those gaps in service provision, there is a lot more to do. That situation is still there and I think there will be problems next year. We need to get to grips with the early intervention classes and increase them dramatically so that there is availability for parents to get their children that much-needed timely intervention. \n Deputy Liam Quaide  The plight of ageing parents of adult children with intellectual disabilities is an area of abject neglect on the part of the Government. Many of these parents are being deprived of peace of mind in their later years because they remain the primary carers of their children. They are less physically able to carry out this role as time goes on. They are living with a constant background worry of not knowing where their children will live after they die and how their need for belonging and community will be met.  The Government’s privatisation of services means that both young people and adults who require 24-hour staffed residential support are increasingly living far from home, in some cases hundreds of kilometres away, not connected to wrap-around services, detached from their communities and families. What is the Taoiseach’s plan to address this particular crisis in residential services for people with intellectual disabilities? Why are these services being privatised and fragmented to such an extent when the outcomes in many cases are so poor for our disabled citizens and when the cost to the State is so enormous? \n Deputy Rose Conway-Walsh  It is an absolute disgrace that even today we still do not know which children were wrongly removed from the scoliosis waiting list or why it happened. Families have been left in the dark while children suffer in pain. There is a clear culture of secrecy, concealment and unaccountability at the heart of children’s healthcare and an utter lack of transparency. I want to talk to the Taoiseach again, after many other times I have done so, about Mikey Henry Benson from Mayo, who is still waiting for the procedures he needs. I want to ask the Taoiseach to ask the Minister for Health when she is in Mayo on Monday to meet the family of Mikey Henry Benson to go through the episodes and the pain they have gone through and to find a way forward so that we can ensure that Mikey Henry Benson stays alive? \n Deputy Cian O'Callaghan  The Government has said time and again that there should be an appropriate school place for every child. I am contacted constantly by parents who are desperately trying to get a place for their child in an autism class. The same as any other parent, they just want their child to be able to thrive. Stapolin Educate Together National School in Baldoyle has asked to open two additional new autism classes. The school has the space for the modular units required. It also has experienced staff who can support the opening of these two additional classes. All that is required is for approval to be granted. Is the Minister for education going to meet the school principal about this and when is approval going be granted for these two much-needed classes? \n Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett  While I was getting my treatment in St. Luke's, I met a very nice woman called Shirley who brought up her daughter Lauren's case with me. Lauren subsequently wrote to me. Lauren lives with her and has a life-long disability condition that means she is unfit for work. She had previously been on domiciliary care allowance, then on disability allowance, but she then got married. She lives at home with her mum still, being cared for by her mum, but because she got married and went over the threshold, her disability payment has been cut. It really highlights the massive problem and injustice of having means testing of disability payments. What does the Taoiseach have to say to Lauren and many others like her who lose all support for their disability on the basis that their partner’s income has gone over a very arbitrary threshold? \n An Leas-Cheann Comhairle  We are gone way over time, so I would ask the Taoiseach to consider that. \n The Taoiseach  We are about seven minutes over time, is it? \n An Leas-Cheann Comhairle  Yes. \n The Taoiseach  I will try to do what I can as quickly as I can. \n An Leas-Cheann Comhairle  No, you are okay. Just ----- \n The Taoiseach  No, I am conscious of others.  Deputy Dempsey raised the issue of transition from child services to adult services and that there was an absence of early planning for that. She also made the comment that parents were told that therapies would not be available in transition. That is not acceptable and respite should not be withdrawn. In the disability unit that I have established, a key workstream will be planning and designing for the future. There should be proper data and proper early analysis of expected need for services from primary to post-primary, from post-primary to adult or, indeed, continuing education or other aspects. That is where I want to get to and that is where we want to get to as a Government because there is no doubt - Deputy Ardagh has raised this as well, as have others - that the insecurity is shocking. It is very sad that so many parents – I have met them – have no certainty. Deputy Daly said it was a cliff edge, and it is for many. If one talks to some of the providers in the sections 38 and 39 organisations, they are all dealing with emergency cases. That is not satisfactory, so we have got to get a more planned approach to this transition. I think there are also issues in terms of the interaction between the sections 38 and 39 organisations and the Government and Government services and how that works. Many of those are under pressure as well, I have to acknowledge, but equally we have to work out the models and so forth. There should be proper databases outlining how many people are in a given service at a given time and what will the requirements be at a later date. There is that issue of creating a secure transition and that older parents in particular, senior citizens now, have a certain sense of security and knowledge well in advance that their children will be looked after in case anything happens to themselves. That is a very understandable human concern, which is not being met at the moment but that needs to be met. I am very determined that we would put services in place to enable that to happen. There is a fear there, as Deputy Ardagh said. She called for a national plan for this and that is something I am going to work on so that people will have that security. Other Deputies have raised that issue. We should be looking at a seamless transition, ideally.  There is a link into housing as well in that respect, different solutions at different times in the journey of life that people can move to better accommodation, more suitable accommodation. We should have greater flexibility around that provision. There can be too many silos between different Government Departments in respect of that but we are working on it. That is what the Cabinet subcommittee is for, to do a cross-government, whole-of-government approach.  Deputy Daly and others raised the income disregard and the cost of disability. The cost of disability will be looked at in the next budget and there is a working group established in relation to that. On the relationship between work and disability payments, there are some supports there for transitioning from disability, from the social protection system, into work in terms of the medical card and others. I think that can be strengthened and that those moving into work can be given greater certainty, more long-term certainty, that they will retain their benefits or whatever entitlements they have as they go into work. There have been improvements on the employer grant and so on but there is further work to be done in terms of giving greater security around that transition and encouraging people to go into work without fear of losing their health entitlements or the various other entitlements they have.  Earlier during Leaders' Questions, we dealt with questions in respect of Harvey Morrison Sherratt. I would say to the Deputy the Minister is this afternoon meeting with the parents. The Minister did look for a chronology from the HSE. The Minister has that. The CEO of the HSE shared that with the family. It is a draft because the HSE wanted the family's input into that.

That commissioner has the specific protected disclosure and is now going to deal with that. Without question, there is a meeting on between the Minister, the Tánaiste and the parents of Harvey, with a view to an inquiry. The precise format is to be determined.  Deputy Coppinger had a similar question in relation to this. It is a fundamental question as to why Harvey was taken off a waiting list. There are clinical decisions clearly involved here that have to be examined and will be examined. Likewise, there are other, broader investigations and examinations of issues pertaining to CHI, as the Deputy knows. Some of them have come in and some have not. Overall, again, terms of reference have to be specific here. We can have statutory inquiries that can go on too long and do not give closure to families. I think there is a bit of work to be done yet and the Minister is meeting with the family in that regard.  Deputy Murphy raised the issue of the cost of disability programme. I dealt with that earlier insofar as the next budget will be dealing with that. Once-off payments were two years. What we were determined to do in this budget was to increase the permanent payments within the social protection system, which we did, for example, and to enhance them as well and also, in terms of the carer's allowance threshold and income disregard, to increase that and we will eliminate that over the lifetime of this Government. We increased the domiciliary care allowance significantly.  In terms of education, there are now about 46,500 teachers and SNAs working in our education system, committed to supporting and nurturing children with special educational needs. Huge numbers of special needs assistants have been appointed over the past number of years. There are about 400 new special classes in the budget of 2025, and about 2,700 new places for the 2025-2026 school year. Some of those school places are under construction and being put in place. A number of specifics have been asked. I will check those out with the Minister. I am not in a position to have knowledge of every single application from individual schools in respect of autism classes and so forth but I will follow those up with the Minister.
